Starting with a TrailBlazer LTZ or TrailBlazer EXT with the Leather Plus Package, Chevy adds body-color cladding, unique seats, mesh map pockets, rain-sensing wipers, liftgate lighting, an underfloor storage cargo liner, heavy-duty cargo mats, an adjustable cargo shelf (EXT model only) and The North Face duffel bags and blanket. Not for you? Perhaps a V8 will suit your fancy. Chevy's 5.3-liter V8 is available on the TrailBlazer EXT only. Other changes for 2003 include a larger 22-gallon fuel tank (late fall availability) and additional child-seat anchors on EXT models. Chevy has also made some previously standard equipment optional, such as the side airbags, rear cargo shade, interior lighting and auto-dimming driver-side mirror.

Audi,audi tt,2001,audi tt 2001,"['Distinctive styling, cutting-edge interior, optional all-wheel drive.']","['Useless back seat in coupe, interior ergonomics take getting used to, lacks low-end grunt.']",4.7,"For 2001 Audi introduces the TT Roadster, which retains the same interior and chassis as the coupe. Makes sense, as the coupe was designed with the roadster version in mind. There's also a 225-horsepower quattro version for both the coupe and convertible. For buyers seeking the ultimate performance sport coupe (or roadster), the 2001 Audi TT will likely disappoint. But those willing to give up, say, 12 percent of sheer ability will get back at least 25 percent in pure style. The Audi TT concept car was introduced in 1995, and we hated it. Subsequently, we've had numerous visual encounters and chances to get behind the wheel. You could say we've developed an acquired taste. In person, the car just looks right, appearing aggressive and graceful at the same time. The rear boasts rounded flanks and a cleanly arced roofline. Purposeful styling details are executed with ice-cold precision; it is an instant classic - a shape that will be a topic of discussion for years. The ride ain't too shabby, either. Audi's entry-level TT comes with a front-engine, front-drive powertrain layout. Its turbocharged, 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine makes 180 horsepower and is connected to a five-speed manual transmission, achieving zero to 60 in 7.4 seconds. Also available is a massaged 225-horsepower engine that shaves nearly a second off of that time. With standard all-wheel drive, it can reach a top speed of 143 mph. The torque is increased as well, from 173 to 207 foot-pounds, but we still feel that both are lacking in low-range take off. Once you overcome that, though, hang on to your toupees! The TT Coupe has a sparse interior and a nearly useless rear seat. Inside, Audi has created a visual and tactile feast of aluminum, leather and stainless steel. The effect is successful, appearing to be expensively outfitted, but not luxurious in the traditional sense. And, thanks to the hatchback design for the coupe, the TT offers owners some utility, carrying 13.8 cubic feet of cargo with the rear seat up and 24.2 cubic feet if the rear seat is folded down. The numbers go down for the quattro and convertible versions; but hey, this isn't a minivan. Standard equipment includes leather sport seats, cruise control, a tachometer, alloy wheels, a split-folding rear seat, and an AM/FM stereo with cassette and speed-sensitive volume control. A CD player is optional. Power seats, a sunroof and a full-size spare tire are not available on this car. The front-wheel drive convertible comes with a manually operated top, while the Quattro comes with a power top, both with glass rear window with defrost. To keep passengers safe, Audi installed ABS, traction control and a first-aid kit in the TT. Head and thorax side airbags are also standard. Pre-tensioners and force limiters make seatbelts even more effective than conventional systems and next-generation front airbags deploy at lower speeds. Audi contends that through marvelous feats of engineering and dual roll-bar hoops, the protection level for the convertible in a rollover is equal to that of the coupe. The TT's styling will make it popular with people who like to impress. Whether in coupe or roadster form, the car makes a bold statement you won't soon forget.

The SR5's optional Sport package has gained a front skid plate, floor mats and new tube step-up bars (optional). Handsome 15-inch alloy wheels are now standard, there's a new chrome package available, and Golden Pearl has been added to the Limited's selection of exterior colors. A likeable SUV that reminds you, for better or for worse, of its truck-based origins. In the seven years since the current 4Runner debuted, the segment of the marketplace in which it competes has exploded in popularity and become littered with fine sport-utes. Yet, Toyota's rugged entry continues to represent an excellent choice, despite its age and distinctly truck-like underpinnings.That's right. If you're looking for a tall car, the 4Runner is likely to disappoint with its stiff ride and general lack of road feel. But if it's a roomy vehicle made for serious off-road work, combined with creature comforts and a solid reputation for reliability, that you're after, then you've come to the right place.Buyers can choose between the standard SR5 or luxurious Limited trim, both of which can be had in either two- or four-wheel drive (the Limited comes with a full-time 4WD system). A 3.4-liter dual overhead-cam V6, attached to a four-speed automatic transmission, makes 183 horsepower at 4,800 and 216 pound-feet of torque at 3,600. It's adequate, but you'll likely find yourself wishing for more go-power.Inside, passengers -- once they manage to clamber aboard -- are greeted by a chunky, purposeful dash that wasn't so much styled as it was pieced together. No matter, it works from an ergonomic standpoint. Seating is comfortable and supportive front and rear, with backseat riders benefiting from plenty of legroom. Cloth upholstery in the SR5 Sport is abrasive, but the Limited has far more pleasing leather hides covering the seats.Along with the leather, the Limited also comes with standard features like fake wood trim, heated power driver and passenger seats, automatic climate control and a CD player. These items can't be ordered on the SR5, but there is a Sport package that adds a fender-blistered, hood-scooped, monochromatic exterior treatment on the outside with larger brakes, bigger alloy wheels, a front skid plate and a performance-oriented rear differential underneath.All 4Runners come standard with Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), traction control and ABS enhanced with electronic brake force distribution and brake assist. VSC is a stability control system that helps keep the truck under control when a lateral, or sideways, skid is detected. Brake assist can apply maximum braking power under emergency situations quicker than the driver can.Cargo capacity measures 44.6 cubic feet with the rear seat in use and 79.8 cubic feet with it folded. Able to tow 5,000 pounds when properly equipped, the 4Runner excels off-road, with as much as 11 inches of ground clearance when the optional P265/70R16 tires are selected. A slick, powered rear window in the hatch, combined with the large, optional sunroof and lowered side glass, results in an open, airy vehicle -- much like a convertible, but not.The 4Runner is nevertheless a truck for people who like trucks. Stout and sturdy, rugged inside and out and boasting excellent crash-test scores from both government and industry entities, this SUV, like most other Toyotas, can take whatever you throw at it.",V6 cylinder ,183," 217 lb-ft @ 3,600 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Ford,ford transit-crew-van,2023,ford transit-crew-van 2023,['Cheap'],['Standard engine may be sluggish when carrying a full load'],,"The  Ford Transit Crew splits the difference between the Cargo and Passenger  variants, offering two rows of seats for five passengers while reserving a  sizable portion of the interior for cargo. It won't transport up to 15 people  like the Transit Passenger van, but it's a great option for those who need just  a few more seats, plus enough cargo space to carry their tools and supplies. 
Like  all Transit vans, the Transit Crew comes with only the bare essentials as  standard equipment. It's up to you to add whatever else you need by choosing  from the Transit's long list of options. Ford's full-size van can be had in three  roof heights, two wheelbase lengths, and rear- or all-wheel drive.  Additionally, there's an extended body option that adds a few feet behind the  rear axle. Two gasoline V6 engines are available.
For  2023, Ford introduces an optional in-mirror camera system, allowing drivers to  see behind them even if their cargo van has no rear windows. The base 3.5-liter  V6 also gets an engine stop-start system as standard. Other than that, the  Transit soldiers on with some minor reshuffling of packages and options.
The  Transit might be a commercial vehicle, but it feels surprisingly  consumer-friendly when you're behind the wheel. The dashboard is familiar and  car-like, and the standard infotainment system is easy to use. Opt for the  available Sync 4 system, and you'll be treated to a responsive and intuitive  tablet-sized touchscreen perched atop the dash. It also brings with it upscale  features like wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
The  Ford Transit Crew is a configuration that the full-size van segment hasn't  widely adopted yet. The Mercedes-Benz Sprinter has a crew variant, but other  full-size vans like the Chevrolet Express and Ram ProMaster are offered as  either cargo or passenger models. So if you need something that's a little bit  of both, the Transit Crew could be your best option. There are dozens upon dozens of ways to spec the Transit Crew, and how you order yours will depend on how you intend to use it. Some handy options to consider include adaptive cruise control for driving in traffic, the 360-degree camera system for parking in tight spaces, and the Sync 4 infotainment system for the impressive 12-inch touchscreen and voice command capability.",V6 cylinder ,300," 260 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",rear wheel drive , 10-speed shiftable automatic

But  the RX has also been rather blasé to drive. That changes with the  redesigned 2023 Lexus RX, which is available in a new RX 500h F Sport  Performance flavor.

The RX 500h F Sport Performance uses a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder  engine, a six-speed automatic transmission and a hybrid system to produce  respectably quick acceleration. All-wheel drive is standard, and Lexus says  it's optimized to enhance traction on dry roads as well as in snowy or icy  conditions. More secure handling and upgraded brakes specific to the RX 500h F  Sport Performance should also contribute to the RX 500h's increased  athleticism. 
The  new fifth-generation 2023 RX is the same size as before, but Lexus says it  offers more rear legroom and cargo space inside. Lexus also reworked the tech,  and the new RX features a fully digital dashboard combined with a choice of a  9.8-inch or a 14-inch horizontally oriented touchscreen display. Everywhere you  look it's a step forward from the previous model, and the interior of the RX  looks both more youthful and luxurious. 
Bold  styling, updated infotainment and driver assist features, and modern interior  design and materials help the new RX keep pace with its European luxury rivals.  And if you're looking for both a sporty and luxurious SUV, the RX 500h F Sport  Performance is the model to consider. The new Lexus RX 500h comes only in F Sport Performance trim.

Honda,honda odyssey,1999,honda odyssey 1999,"['This is the best-engineered, most well-planned minivan ever.']",['Leather seats are not available.'],4.1,"Honda's latest minivan, the totally redesigned Odyssey, features the most powerful V6 in the minivan segment. Honda's first attempt at building a minivan came with the 1995 Odyssey -a smallish vehicle that drove like a car but couldn't fit the needs of most American minivan buyers.  The Odyssey was misplaced in the minivan market, which favors a huge, comfortable amount of interior space and versatility to tight taxicab ambience and ease of parallel parking.The new Odyssey can comfortably carry up to seven adult passengers, and it even has room under the seats for easy stowage of hockey sticks or skis.  The suspension, engine, and every inch of sheetmetal are all-new, and the new Odyssey is related to the old Odyssey in name only , the car has been completely redesigned.Starting with the engine, the Odyssey is powered by a 3.5-liter 24-valve VTEC V6, which produces up to 210 horsepower and 229 foot-pounds of torque, while achieving the environmentally friendly status of a low-emission vehicle.  The V6 is based on the Accord's 3.0-liter engine but offers substantially more power, which helps to move a lot of extra girth.The base model LX includes such standard fare as dual sliding doors, power windows (including power rear-vent windows), power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, a theft-deterrent system, two 12-volt power outlets, front and rear air conditioning, antilock brakes, and, of course, the 3.5-liter V6 engine.  That price is actually $800 less than the previous-generation Odyssey LX, and severely undercuts similarly equipped long-wheelbase minivans from the competition. The step-up EX model is exactly the same price as the previous Odyssey EX. The EX features such niceties as dual power sliding doors, body-colored door handles, a roof rack, keyless remote, an eight-way power driver's seat, alloy wheels, traction control, a CD player and steering wheel mounted radio controls.  Plunking down the extra $3,000 for EX trim is worth it, just for the seats, which are infinitely more comfortable than the two-way manually adjustable seats of the LX.  Leather seats are not available, so watch for an Acura version of the Odyssey sometime in the near future.Sitting on a four-wheel independent suspension, a first in the minivan segment, the Odyssey is supported comfortably and it keeps the driver in touch with the road.  Combined with the Odyssey's wide track, the suspension adds a nimble feel to this big car. Body roll around corners is well-damped for a vehicle of this height.Takeoff from a stop is smooth, and gear changing is seamless, even at higher speeds.  The front disc / rear drum brakes slow down the Odyssey smoothly and quickly for such a heavy car.  All in all, it's a high-powered, smooth-shifting minivan that handles with confidence and doesn't make a powerful racket.Instrument panel gauges are easy to read and the center controls are logically placed, and all controls are within easy reach.  The cruise controls are mounted on the steering wheel, as are remote radio controls on the EX model.  The EX is further enhanced with power door controls just left of the steering column.  The interior abounds with cubbyholes and map pockets, and the nine cupholders are all functional, unlike some of the indentations other minivan makers are stamping onto seatbacks these days.  The most unique Odyssey feature continues to be its hideaway, or ""magic"" seat.  With a minimum of effort and the use of one set of hands only, the rear seat can be folded out of sight and flush with the floor in a matter of seconds.  The second row seats are convertible and can be used as separate captains chairs or as a bench. A minivan would not be complete without safety features, and the Odyssey comes with its share.  All seven passenger seating positions have headrests and three-point seatbelts, both firsts in the minivan market.  An Electronic Brake Distribution system (EBD) is also standard.  This system senses the placement and amount of cargo, and compensates for it during hard braking to avoid rear-wheel lockup. The new Odyssey is a marvel of engineering and, if product excellence determines success, it will be the first hugely successful import minivan.  Honda has expanded its horizons with the Odyssey, finally creating an epic worthy the name.",V6 cylinder ,126," 229 lb-ft @ 4,300 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Visually, the Acadia stands out more than  it did before thanks to a tougher face that better matches GMC's truck-oriented  marketing. The Acadia's outdated six-speed automatic is also gone, replaced  with a new nine-speed unit that promises better acceleration and improved fuel  efficiency. GMC has added a new optional turbocharged four-cylinder engine that  should provide similar benefits compared to the base four-cylinder engine. The  3.6-liter V6 engine is still around. 
For  2020, you get the latest generation of GMC's infotainment in the cabin, along  with fast-charging USB-C ports. Finally, there's a new AT4 trim level that has  more rugged styling and a few mild enhancements to aid in off-road situations. 
All  of these changes help make the Acadia a more distinctive choice. Previously, it  failed to offer a significant enough experience compared with its roomier  corporate sibling, the Chevy Traverse. But know that there are more choices  than ever if you're shopping for a three-row crossover SUV. The Honda Pilot,  for example, offers impressive all-around capability, while the slightly  smaller CX-9 provides superior handling and a luxury-level interior. You should  also consider the all-new Kia Telluride, which is one of our top-rated SUVs. Because  of the 2020 changes, there's not much sense in opting for anything less than  the SLT. That gets you the  turbocharged engine, more comfortable second-row captain's chairs and leather  upholstery (among other upgrades).

Premium models can be equipped with a Mach 1000 audio system. Both this system and the Mach 460 get speed-sensitive volume. Later this year, an MP3 player will be available. Performance Red paint is replaced with Torch Red. Despite a performance disadvantage, Ford's Mustang will outlive the Chevy Camaro and Pontiac Firebird, which are being euthanized at the end of the year. Even though it's not perfect, the 2002 Ford Mustang embodies raw American style and power, is fun to drive and easily tossed about, and doesn't break the bank in terms of cost of ownership. Rapidly approaching the big 4-0, Ford's perennially popular Mustang is advancing upon middle age. But if it's going through a mid-life crisis, nobody is noticing. The Mustang is as hot as ever. Ford's sport coupe has outsold GM's Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird for years. This is in spite of the fact that the Mustang has suffered a performance disadvantage since its 1994 redesign.There are four Mustangs from which to choose: the V6 Coupe, the V6 Convertible, the GT Coupe and the GT Convertible. All models can be ordered in either Deluxe or Premium trim. There is also a standard trim available on V6 coupes only. A 3.8-liter pushrod engine that makes 190 horsepower at 5,250 and 220 pound-feet of torque at 2,750 powers the V6 model. Acceleration is acceptable, especially with the standard five-speed manual transmission, though V6 Coupes definitely have a rental-car stigma attached to them.The GT Coupe and Convertible are more in tune with what pony cars should be. Equipped with a 4.6-liter overhead-cam V8, GT output is listed at 260 horsepower at 5,250 and 302 lb-ft of torque at 4,000 rpm. That's good for a 0-to-60 blast of less than 6 seconds, and plenty of twist for tail-out slides around nearly any corner.Standard V6 coupes include features like air conditioning, a dual-media stereo with cassette and CD players, alloy wheels, power windows and door locks, rear defroster and an anti-theft system. Add Deluxe trim, and you get a rear spoiler, floor mats, power driver seat and cruise control (Deluxe convertibles also come with an automatic transmission). Options on Deluxe models include a Mach 460 sound system, ABS with traction control (when the automatic transmission is selected) and a special Sport Appearance Group. Premium models include those items and buy access to the Mach 1000 audio system and leather upholstery.Deluxe GT adds the V8 engine, a traction-lock rear axle, dual exhaust, upgraded suspension, 17-inch wheels shod with performance tires, foglights and cloth sport bucket seats. Leather and a Mach 460 audio system are optional. Step up to a Premium GT, and you'll enjoy those two options as standard, plus a unique set of rims. You'll also be able to select the Mach 1000 audio package. Simple enough, eh?Mustangs offer drivers and passengers comfortable front chairs that lack any semblance of side bolstering, well-placed controls with the exception of teensy stereo buttons, clear views out the front and side windows and acceptable interior materials presented in a retro dual-cowl design cabin. Though technically a four-seater, Mustang's rear seat passengers, especially those riding in the convertible, had better be short.One reason the Mustang has enjoyed continued success is its relaxed, easy-going and tossable nature on the road. Predictable during hard cornering, and exhibiting progressive side-to-side weight transfers, Mustang exhibits commendable stability during high-speed driving. The braking and steering have also impressed us during test drives. Rough pavement can make the ride uncomfortable, however, as the rear suspension still uses a solid rear axle. And watch out for lumpy road surfaces in turns, because the Mustang will easily side-step if the live rear axle gets jostled about.Another Mustang advantage is safety. It offers drivers and front-seat passengers a high level of crash protection as rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. All-speed traction control and antilock brakes are also standard on most trim levels. Ford thoughtfully provides a traction-control defeat switch for those people who like roasting the rear tires on a regular basis.Mustang is one of the most recognizable nameplates on the road. In fact, the term ""pony car"" was coined because of this sporty Ford's name. And since the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird are scheduled for termination later this year, the Mustang will once again become the only traditional rear-drive pony car on the market.

A strong drivetrain, well behaved road manners, and a spacious and comfortable interior makes the Yukon one of the best full size sport utilities on the market. Yukons are popular SUVs, and rightly so.  Featuring room for the family and plenty of gear in one of two well-appointed trim levels in either two- or four-wheel drive with four doors, the Yukon is versatile enough for any task thrown its way.  For 2000, GMC has redesigned the truck from top to bottom, providing buyers with stronger engines, a more robust foundation, more seats inside, and nicely updated sheetmetal that, if not ground-breaking, is at least attractive.Starting with the stiff new Sierra pickup platform, engineers ladled a number of luxury goodies atop a slightly larger four-door cabin.  In keeping with its rugged luxo-truck image, even basic Yukon SLEs are well-equipped with a 275-horsepower, 4.8-liter Vortec V8 engine, aluminum alloy wheels, deep tinted glass, and front and rear air conditioning.  Other standards include power windows, locks and doors, a CD player pumping out the jams through nine premium quality speakers, and an electrochromic rearview mirror with compass.  Step up to SLT trim and you'll be rewarded with leather upholstery. All Yukons come with four-wheel disc ABS for short stopping distances and a five-link, semi-floating coil-spring rear suspension for improved ride characteristics. An optional Autoride suspension system can vary shock dampening automatically as needed, and 4WD models can be equipped with a stout Z71 off-road suspension package. Front and side airbags are standard, and an optional traction-control system keeps the 2WD Yukon's tail planted in the slippery stuff.An automatic transmission is the only way you can go in the new Yukon, but an optional 5.3-liter V8 engine is available if you need the extra torque for towing. Also extra cost is a power sunroof, automatic climate control, rear-seat audio controls, a luxury package that adds heated power front seats and a HomeLink transmitter, and, for the first time, a third-row seat that expands seating to a maximum of nine passengers, albeit at the expense of valuable cargo space.One of the great things about the Yukon is that it gives you plenty of interior room and luggage capacity in a garageable, daily-driver package. Despite its full-size SUV status, it's manageable in tight quarters and quite responsive, particularly the 2WD model, which is equipped with a carlike rack-and-pinion steering system. And now, with third-row seating, you can have the practicality of a minivan and the go-anywhere capability of an SUV, in one easy-to-live-with package.

The 2021 GMC Sierra 3500HD is a  truck that's made to work, even in its most well-appointed trims.

You'd have to search hard to find a trailer or  collection of equipment too heavy for you to pull or haul with this maxed-out  Sierra.  Only  a few trucks offer the same performance and capabilities as the Sierra 3500HD,  though that doesn't make the segment any less competitive or cutthroat. The  Ford F-350 Super Duty and Ram 3500 offer their own take on the heavy-duty truck  formula. In our minds, the two have slightly more comfortable and  better-appointed interiors, making them better to live with day to day without  sacrificing performance. There's  also the Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD. It's nearly identical to the Sierra save  for interior and exterior design as well as a few features and optional  equipment.

New front and rear fascias, and new engine mounts, which reduce engine vibration and harshness, are the only other changes to Hyundai's smallest car. What a pleasant surprise from Hyundai.  If the latest Sonata hinted at the direction the company was to take in the future, then the Accent is an in-your-face declaration from this Korean manufacturer that the days of selling shoddy, inept vehicles in the United States are over.  The Accent is one of the better subcompacts in today's market.However, you've got to pay for excellence, and the Accent is among the more expensive subcompacts. In contrast, a Chevrolet Metro sedan is a tad less pricey than the Accent.  There is a reason for this: the Metro doesn't come standard with such niceties as rear window defogger, cargo area lighting, remote releases for the fuel door and trunk or digital clock.  Additionally, the Accent benefits from single-piece side stampings, which contribute to stiffer body rigidity, and a 92-horsepower engine that far outranks the top-line 70-horse motor provided in the Chevy.  Is the Hyundai worth the additional $400 over the Metro?  Absolutely!  The Metro feels a bit roomier, but the Accent offers more equipment and feels more solidly constructed than the tinny Chevrolet.Unfortunately for Hyundai, another South Korean automaker has entered the U.S. market, expanding rapidly during the past couple of years.  Kia builds the Sephia sedan, and it is larger and more powerful than the Hyundai.  The Sephia can be loaded to the gills for little more than the Accent, and looks more expensive than it really is in top-level trim.Aside from the putrid seat fabrics, childish paint schemes and funky smell associated with all new Hyundais, we like the Accent quite a bit.

Toyota,toyota tundra,2000,toyota tundra 2000,"['You can finally get a full-size, V8-powered pickup with Toyota build-quality.']","['Lack of options and platform configurations when compared to Ford, GM, and Dodge Trucks.']",4.5,"The 2000 Toyota Tundra is an all-new, full-size pickup truck designed to compete with the Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado 1500, GMC Sierra 1500 and Dodge Ram 1500. It features an optional V8 engine and can be ordered in a two- or four-door, regular- or extended-cab configuration. The 2000 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup suited more for the general consumer than commercial use. As the maker of America's best-selling automobile (the Camry), it must have been frustrating for Toyota to learn that trucks are now outselling cars in this country. Especially since the closest thing to a full-size pickup truck previously offered by Toyota was the anemic and poorly received T100. With the introduction of the Tundra in spring of 1999, as a 2000 model, Toyota has finally crafted a full-fledged, maximum-sized pickup, capable of running with the big dogs. Topping its pedigree is an optional 4.7-liter, I-Force V8 engine lifted directly from the Land Cruiser/LX 470 sport utility twins. This powerplant makes 245 horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque and is available only with a four-speed automatic transmission. Payload capacity is 2,000 pounds and towing capacities for the V8 start at 5,000 pounds (it goes up to 7,000 pounds with an optional tow package). A 3.4-liter V6, making 190 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque is standard on base model Tundras, which may be mated to either a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission.Toyota has also met the demand of current truck buyers when it comes to configuration. The Tundra is available in regular and extended-cab versions, the latter with two rear-facing doors for easier rear-seat access (which, by the way, is what Toyota calls its four-door Tundra layout: Access Cab). Unfortunately, regular-cab versions come in longbed form only while Access Cab models come only as shortbeds.Inside, the Tundra feels a bit more compact than its American counterparts, but not uncomfortably so for front-seat passengers. Rear seating is another matter, with legroom at a premium for anyone of average height. With the exception of rear seating, the Tundra cabin is an excellent place to spend the day. It offers a quiet ride that surpasses competing trucks, as well as many cars. Options like leather seating and a 10-disc CD changer further contribute to the Tundra's relaxing internal environment.We wish Toyota offered more variety in areas like configuration and option packages, and an increase in rear-seat legroom would help the Tundra better compete with the extended cab models from GM, Ford and Dodge. Still, the very fact that a V8-powered, full-size pickup can now be had with a Toyota nameplate on it means that there's a whole new set of rules for America's truck buyer.",V6 cylinder ,382,,all wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Chevrolet,chevrolet blazer,1999,chevrolet blazer 1999,"['Still-handsome styling, wide range of features and options, competent drivetrain.']","['Spotty build quality, cheesy interior parts, uncomfortable rear seats, no V8 option.']",3.6,"Blazer gets automatic transmission improvements, new exterior colors and larger outside mirrors, while four-wheel-drive versions can be equipped with GM's AutoTrac active transfer case. Inside, there are new power-seating features, upgraded sound system options and available redundant radio controls in the steering wheel. On the safety side, the '99 Blazer now offers a vehicle content theft alarm, flash-to-pass headlamp feature and a liftgate ajar warning lamp. What's more, a new TrailBlazer trim package is available on four-door versions, featuring monochrome paint with gold accents, unique aluminum wheels, touring suspension and leather-lined interior. Back in 1982, Chevrolet rolled out the S-10 Blazer, the first modern compact sport-utility vehicle.  Seventeen years later, the Blazer remains a strong seller in one of the hottest automotive markets. Take only one good look and it's easy to see why the Blazer has such lasting appeal.Powered by a stout 4.3-liter, 190-horsepower V6 and available with several suspension choices, the Blazer can be tailored to specific needs, as either two-wheel or four-wheel drive, with two doors or four.  The four-door is the most popular by far, easily the model of choice with families on the go.  There are accommodations for as many as six passengers in the bigger Blazer, if they don't mind squeezing. There's lots of cargo space too, with the spare tire mounted underneath the cargo floor on four-door models. Chevy claims that with the rear seat folded, a washing machine box will fit into the cargo bay. We actually tried it with a test vehicle, and they aren't fibbing. Sadly, the Blazer's interior is marred by acres of chintzy plastic and precious little rear foot room in front of a rather low and mushy seat.  Adult rear-seat riders are likely to complain loudly.Off road is not where the Blazer shines brightest, despite the availability of a ZR2 super-duty suspension package. Offered only on two-door 4WD models, the ZR2 Blazer has a special chassis with a four-inch wider track, huge 31-inch tires, specially tuned Bilstein 46mm shocks, drivetrain refinements, an underbody shield package and LS trim. Regular Blazers are capable enough for two-track dirt, but serious off-road adventures would be better handled by something with a little more wheel travel. It's not a major shortcoming, being that most families don't spend much time off road (if any) in their sport-utes.On the other hand, as a road-going hauler the Blazer is quite capable. All 4x4 models come standard with GM's Insta-Trac shift-on-the-fly 4WD system, or can be equipped with the new for '99 AutoTrac pushbutton electronic transfer case. AutoTrac automatically senses wheel slippage and sends power to the axle with the most traction, which makes those old full-time all-wheel-drive systems obsolete. This setup takes the guesswork out of sure-footed travel over wet or snowy pavement.GM's PassLock anti-theft system, automatic headlight control and four-wheel disc brakes are all standard. Heated exterior mirrors and an electrochromic rearview mirror are standard on LT models, and optional on the LS.  Three new colors debut: Victory Red, Sunset Gold and Meadow Green Metallic.For 1999, Chevrolet has added power-seat enhancements, sound system upgrades with optional steering wheel radio controls and CD changer. There's also a new headlamp flash-to-pass feature, a liftgate ajar warning lamp and a vehicle content theft deterrent system on Blazers equipped with remote keyless entry. An all-new model, the TrailBlazer, is based on a four-door LT and then adds a monochrome exterior theme with gold accents, special alloy wheels, the Z85 Touring Suspension and two-tone leather-trimmed interior.When the current Blazer debuted for the 1995 model year, it won the North American Truck of the Year award. Smart styling, a powerful drivetrain and reasonable pricing made it an instant hit. Lately, however, the competition has again raised the bar on the Blazer. The segment-leading Ford Explorer finally got a new V6 in 1997 that is more refined and powerful than the Blazer's V6, and it's sister, the Mercury Mountaineer, has an available V8. That same year, Jeep updated the Cherokee, offering nearly as much interior space as the Blazer and 4WD for around $20,000. For 1998, the Dodge Durango came to market as an instant success, and Jeep has now gone back and redesigned its Grand Cherokee for '99. Simply put, with all the new product in the compact-SUV world, this Chevy isn't the value it used to be.",,142,,all wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Honda,honda insight,2013,honda insight 2013,"['Thrifty fuel economy', 'low price for a hybrid.']","['Unsophisticated ride', 'cramped backseat', 'air-conditioning shuts off with auto-off engine at traffic lights.']",3.9,"After numerous updates last year, the 2013 Honda Insight returns unchanged. While fuel-efficient and reliable, the 2013 Honda Insight doesn't quite measure up to its archrival, the Toyota Prius. Though  coming off a minor makeover last year, the 2013 Honda Insight continues to be a  lackluster choice for a hybrid, despite its low, sub-$20,000 MSRP. A growing  number of new gasoline- and diesel-powered compacts that are nearly as fuel-efficient  add to the challenge it faces.
The  Insight does have a couple things going for it. For one, its petite size and  somewhat firm suspension tuning make it relatively fun to drive for a  fuel-economy-oriented hybrid. It also remains one of the most fuel-efficient  cars you'll find in America, with an EPA-estimated 42 mpg combined, since this  is one of the few hybrids that gets great highway mpg as well as great city  mpg. If a low entry price and high mpg are your main priorities, you'll  probably be satisfied with the Insight.
Unfortunately  for Honda,  there are better choices out there with those same qualities. The most obvious  is the Toyota Prius C.  It is very similar to the Insight in terms of concept and price, yet has more  available features and gets notably better fuel economy (50 mpg combined). You'll  also get better fuel economy from the Honda Civic  Hybrid, a more  expensive but much nicer car overall. Non-hybrids like the Ford Fiesta and Volkswagen Golf TDI,  which are EPA-rated at 40 mpg or better on the highway, are also worth  considering. Overall, we think most people will be happier with one of the  aforementioned choices. The  2013 Honda Insight is propelled by a hybrid system comprising a 1.3-liter  four-cylinder gasoline engine paired with an electric motor and a nickel-metal  hydride battery pack. The gas engine is good for 88 horsepower and 88  pound-feet of torque, while the electric motor contributes 13  and 58 lb-ft. Due  to varying power peaks, the maximum combined output is 98  and 123 lb-ft of  torque. Power flows to the front wheels through a continuously variable  automatic transmission (CVT).
In  Edmunds testing, the Insight accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 10.8 seconds,  identical to the Prius C. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 41 mpg city/44 mpg  highway and 42 mpg combined. The  2013 Honda Insight comes standard with antilock brakes (front disc, rear drum),  stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags  and active front head restraints.
In  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety tests, the Insight received the best  possible rating of ""Good"" in frontal offset, side crash and roof  strength tests. On  the road, the 2013 Honda Insight drives less like a hybrid and more like a  familiar gasoline-only-powered model. This is due in large part to the fact that  the four-cylinder engine is always used to propel the vehicle, with the  electric motor kicking in when more power is needed. This is in contrast to hybrid  powertrains like that in the Toyota Prius that can propel the car at low speeds  via the electric power plant. This is why the Insight gives you both good city  and highway mpg, while other hybrids deliver only good highway mpg.
The  Insight's well-calibrated steering and firmer suspension make it more enjoyable  to drive than the Prius C, though not as much as non-hybrid competitors like  the Ford Fiesta and Mazda 2. The downsides here include a ride that may be a  little too firm for some people's tastes and a cabin that is somewhat noisy. The  Honda Insight's passenger cabin is a little on the spartan side, especially in  base models that lack the center console and have just a single pair of  speakers for the stereo. On a positive note, gauges and controls are  well-placed and intuitive. Especially noteworthy are the graphic displays that  coach you on driving in the most fuel-efficient manner possible, with changing  background color of the speedometer.
While  the Insight's front buckets are comfortable enough, the rear seat is a little  short of both head- and legroom. Interior cargo space -- 15.9 cubic feet behind  the 60/40-split rear seats and 31.5 cubic feet with those seatbacks folded down  -- is about as expected, though you'll find more from other hatchbacks. 
Standard  equipment on the base Insight includes 15-inch steel wheels, automatic climate  control, full power accessories, driver-seat height adjustment,  60/40-split-folding rear seats, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a trip  computer and a two-speaker sound system with a CD player and an auxiliary audio  input jack.
The  midrange LX adds cruise control, a front center armrest and storage bin and an  upgraded sound system with four speakers and an iPod/USB audio interface. 
The  EX comes with 15-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, heated mirrors, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, Bluetooth phone connectivity and a six-speaker sound  system. The EX can also be equipped with a touchscreen navigation system that includes  voice controls, a digital audio card reader and a rearview camera.",,210,,all wheel drive , Continuously variable-speed automatic 
Jeep,jeep grand-cherokee,1996,jeep grand-cherokee 1996,['Cheap'],,4.2,"Jeep turns its flagship into an Explorer killer with dual airbags, revised styling, a better V6 engine, improved front suspension and an upgraded Selec-Trac four-wheel-drive system. Interiors have been restyled, featuring new luxury doodads and an optional integrated child safety seat. Trim levels are two: Laredo and Limited. For years, the Ford Explorer has been the best-selling sport-utility vehicle in this country, but in 1993 a new challenger called Grand Cherokee arrived to try to wrest the sales crown away from the champ.  It was not successful.  However, it did outsell every other sport utility on the market, and became the Explorer's biggest threat.Indeed, this Jeep has the most car-like feel of sport utilities, and is among the most stable on pavement.  In fact, with the optional 5.2-liter V8 pumping away under the hood, the Grand Cherokee becomes the Porsche of sport-utes.  Equipped with a new-for-1996 dual airbag system and four-wheel antilock disc brakes, Grand Cherokee buyers have long list of equipment to wade through, including three different drive systems, three diffenrent trim levels, and a host of luxury and convenience items.The exterior is all hard edges and angles, but is instantly recognizable as a Jeep product and looks rugged.  A  retro touch we could do without is the location of the spare tire.  The Grand Cherokee doesn't have tiny tires, and the cargo area is among the smallest in the class to begin with, so why is the tire in the cargo area?  It should be under the cargo floor, mounted under the truck or placed on a rack on the liftgate.  Otherwise, we have few quibbles with this sport-ute.Jeep spent some time improving the Grand Cherokee for 1996.  Cosmetically, the grille, fascias and cladding have altered for a more cohesive appearance.  On top-level models, the fog lights have been moved from their precarious perch on top of the front bumper to nicely integrated recesses in the front air dam  New deep-dish wheels are too deeply dished, making the JGC look taller and less stable than the 1995 model.  The base 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine has been improved, resulting in more usable torque and quieter operation.  Selec-Trac full-time four-wheel drive and the front suspension have been upgraded as well.Inside, Jeep restyled the bulky dash.  It now has nicely rounded and contoured edges, and houses the aforementioned dual airbags.  Memory seat, radio and mirror settings are standard on the Limited, as are six-way power heated front seats and variable-assist power steering.  All models get new seat fabrics and an upgraded center console.  Trim levels number two this year; Laredo and Limited, with the top-of-the-line Orvis Package available on the Limited.  Five new colors round out the changes.  As you can see, Jeep isn't resting on its laurels waiting for the competition to leave the Grand Cherokee in the dust.Unfortunately, just as Jeep caught up to and surpassed the Explorer in comfort and safety features, Ford went and squeezed a V8 under the Explorer's hood.  Now, the Ford has a V8, dual airbags and a trick Control Trac 4WD system, like the Jeep.  The Ford also has more room, a more comfy rear seat, and a lower price tag.  Plus, you don't have to load cargo around a big ol' tire in the back.  The verdict?  For around town family hauling, we prefer the value-packed Explorer XLT.  But for speedy fun and off-road prowess, the JGC Laredo V8 gets our vote.",,563,,all wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

It's a successful, if controversial, formula and one of the  most influential in automotive history. Since the original X6 debuted, Audi,  Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and more have released coupe variants of more staid SUVs  to varying degrees of success.  Roofline  aside, the new X6 mirrors the X5 in just about every way. You can pick from  three models that are distinguished primarily by engine. The base trim is the  X6 sDrive40i that comes with a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder (335  horsepower and 330 lb-ft of torque). It's mated to an eight-speed automatic  transmission that sends power to the rear wheels. The next step up is the X6  xDrive40i, which adds all-wheel drive. At  least for the time being, the X6 M50i is the top dog, sporting a turbocharged  4.4-liter V8 that increases output to 523  and 553 lb-ft of torque. All-wheel  drive is standard. In the spring, it will be surpassed by the high-performance  X6 M that will set itself apart from the rest with 600 .As  always, it's difficult to justify a purchase of this ilk. One of the most  important reasons for getting an SUV is to transport more passengers and their  things. Going with the X6 reduces that advantage, and you'll pay more for the  privilege to boot. But the X6 does boast a sleeker silhouette, and that definitely  counts for something on the emotional side of the car-purchasing ledger.  We  recommend going with either the two-wheel-drive sDrive40i or the all-wheel-drive xDrive40i. Sure, the X6 M50i offers greater performance and a  killer soundtrack thanks to its stout V8, but the 40i offers plenty of grunt  for day-to-day driving. The money you save compared to the V8-powered model is  best spent on options such as the M Sport package, an upgraded interior and  more driver assistance features.",,140,,all wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

All trim levels get an upgraded touchscreen interface with new smartphone app integration. There also are new optional safety systems and driver assistance technologies. Finally, Subaru has created a new special edition of the WRX STI called the Series Hyper Blue. When you take a spin in a 2016 Subaru WRX, you can tell right away that it has the right stuff. It's a blast to drive thanks to its turbocharged power and sharp handling, and the standard all-wheel drive is a definite bonus if you live in a place with a lot of wet weather. Learn more about what else we like about this sport sedan below. After its complete redesign for 2015, the 2016 Subaru WRX  offers the same heaps of power and performance as before, for a relatively  affordable price. The base engine is one of the strongest in its class, with  sub 6- second 0-60 acceleration even in the base model with the optional  continuously variable automatic transmission. The WRX is a lot of fun when the  road gets twisty, too, thanks to its precise steering, nimble handling and  standard all-wheel drive. The upgrade STI version simply ups the ante.
Unhappily, though, the WRX interior appointments and design remain  pretty middle-of-the-pack, and the cabin isn't as insulated against high-speed  wind and road noise as much as we'd like. Many will find the STI's track-tuned  suspension still a bit too stiff for comfortable daily driving as well.

The 2016 Subaru WRX  carries on from last year's redesign with just a few changes.
But will you really care? That depends on your priorities. The  closest competition for the WRX has traditionally come from the Mitsubishi  Lancer, but the Ralliart and Evolution are discontinued for 2016. Instead, look  to hot hatchbacks from Ford and Volkswagen. Ford offers its front-drive,  252-horsepower Focus ST and  all-new all-wheel-drive Focus RS, while VW builds the Golf GTI and all-wheel-drive Golf R.  All four deliver stellar performance along with high-quality interiors. The Mini Cooper JCW hatchback remains one of our favorites in the sport-performance class as well.  But overall, the 2016 Subaru WRX remains hard to beat if performance and fun  top your list of desires for an affordable performance car. Subaru's 2.0-liter turbocharged, horizontally opposed  four-cylinder ""boxer"" engine continues to power the 2016 WRX model in  all three trim levels. Its 268 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque are  directed to the all-wheel-drive system through a standard six-speed manual transmission.  An optional CVT with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters that let the tranny  impersonate either a six- or eight-speed automatic, depending on driving mode,  is available for the WRX Premium and Limited trim levels. The WRX Premium and Limited  trims also get inverted front struts for improved handling.

The 2016 Subaru WRX  cranks out 265 , while the STI boosts it up to 305 .
In Edmunds testing, a manual-equipped WRX posted a speedy 5.4-second  0-60-mph run. Subaru says the WRX with a CVT needs 5.9 seconds to cover the  same distance. EPA-estimated  fuel economy for the WRX with a manual transmission is 23 mpg  combined (20 city/27 highway), while CVT-equipped models are unchanged at 21 mpg  combined (18 city/24 highway).
The STI steps up the game with a 2.5-liter turbocharged  four-cylinder boxer engine rated at 305  and 290 lb-ft of torque. A beefed-up  six-speed manual is the only transmission available. In our testing, the STI  accelerated to 60 mph in just 5.0 seconds. EPA fuel economy is 19 mpg combined (17 city/23 highway).  Every WRX model  gets standard traction and stability control, antilock disc brakes, active  front head restraints, a rearview back-up camera, front seat side airbags, side  curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag. Blind spot detection, rear cross-traffic  alert and lane departure warning systems are options on the WRX Limited with  either the manual or CVT, and are standard on the STI Limited.
Subaru's EyeSight front collision mitigation system,  however, is reserved for the WRX Limited with a CVT. The package adds adaptive  cruise control, automated pre-collision braking, and lane keeping assistance  systems and independently operating, steering-responsive foglights to help  illuminate curves.
In Edmunds brake testing, a WRX stopped from 60 mph in a  short 106 feet. An STI actually took a bit longer at 108 feet in our test,  though its upgraded brakes showed superior fade resistance after multiple panic  stops compared to the regular WRX.
The WRX received the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's  highest rating of ""Good"" for small overlap and moderate overlap frontal-offset  collision tests, side impact resistance, roof strength and whiplash protection. The 2016 Subaru WRX's turbocharged 2.0-liter engine is  muscular throughout its operating range and delivers a particularly addictive  flood of midrange power. The manual is likely to remain the transmission of  choice for true gearheads, despite its tricky-to-modulate clutch action. The  CVT is more refined than most, and the steering-wheel-mounted shifter paddles  combine with the WRX's driver-selectable operating modes to present plenty of  opportunity to make the most of the engine's output.
As is only right and fitting for a car with World Rally  Championship heritage, the WRX is tight and precise, devouring twists in the  road with confidence. Subaru's big gun, the 2016 WRX STI, raises the bar a few  more pegs with its more powerful engine, limited-slip differentials, hefty  Brembo brakes and beefed-up six-speed manual. It's a blast to drive and makes  the most of its all-wheel-drive traction, but the side effect is the stiff ride  quality, which can be jarring even for this class of car. WRX interiors typically have taken a backseat to performance,  and that's the case with the 2016 WRX. What you get is a pretty basic design  and layout, but with simple and easy-to-use controls. The base audio system is  improved this year, however, and now has a 6.2-inch screen.

Subaru improved  the base audio system for the 2016 WRX, now with smartphone integration and a  6.2-inch touchscreen. A 7-inch screen is optional.
Seating is pretty roomy, as is the trunk, and while  hatchbacks still have an edge, cargo space (12 cubic feet) is further helped by  the fold-down rear seatbacks. The WRX is a driver's car and the driving  position is spot on, as are the firm, nicely bolstered sport seats. Thin roof  pillars provide for excellent outward visibility, and large side mirrors make  it easy to monitor conditions to the side and rear. 
Standard WRX features include 17-inch wheels and summer  performance tires, a trunk-lid spoiler, cruise control, sport front seats,  automatic climate control, a 4.3-inch vehicle information display, a height-adjustable  driver seat, a tilt-and-telescoping leather-wrapped steering wheel, a rearview  camera, 60/40-split fold-down rear seatbacks, Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity and Subaru's Starlink six-speaker infotainment system with 6.2-inch  touchscreen, satellite and HD radio, CD player, USB interface and auxiliary  input and smartphone integration.
Stepping up to the WRX Premium gets you 18-inch wheels and  summer tires, foglights, a power sunroof, heated front seats, windshield wiper  de-icers and heated outside mirrors. The Limited model adds to that with an  eight-way power driver seat, leather-trimmed upholstery, LED low-beam headlamps  and keyless ignition and entry.
WRX Premium buyers who stick with the manual transmission can  get the optional 7-inch Starlink screen and premium nine-speaker Harman Kardon audio  system, bundled with navigation. Limited buyers who select the CVT can get the  navigation and premium audio system bundled with Subaru's optional EyeSight front  collision mitigation system. It includes adaptive cruise control, automated pre-collision  braking, lane departure warning and lane-keeping assistance systems. The package  also includes an electronic parking brake, blind spot detection, navigation, rear  cross-traffic alert and steering-responsive foglights that help illuminate  corners and curves.
The WRX Limited with a manual transmission can be ordered  with the optional blind spot detection and rear cross-traffic alert systems bundled  with navigation and the premium nine-speaker media system. The EyeSight system,  though, is not available with the stick shift.
The 2016 WRX STI model comes with all the WRX and WRX Premium  items except the sunroof but adds a more powerful engine, Brembo brakes, front  and rear limited-slip differentials, driver-selectable modes for the center  differential and a more aggressively tuned suspension. Dual-zone climate control  is also standard. Step up to the STI Limited trim level and you'll get back the  sunroof and add keyless ignition and entry, blind spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alert and the premium audio system with navigation and the 7-inch  Starlink screen.
Options for STI models are limited to a package for the base  trim that includes keyless ignition and entry, navigation and the premium audio  system. The only option for buyers of the STI Limited is the no-cost choice  between the iconic rally-style tall wing spoiler or the new low-profile trunk  lip spoiler.
There's also a limited edition of the STI available this  year. Called Series Hyper Blue, it's essentially an STI Limited but with  special exterior paint and interior trim.",,185,,all wheel drive , 6-speed manual 
Subaru,subaru forester,1999,subaru forester 1999,['Handles like a car.  Accelerates like a car.  Rides like a car.'],['Travels off-road like a car.'],4.2,"Forester's engine makes more torque and the automatic transmission has been improved. L and S models have longer lists of standard equipment and two new colors are available. What do you do when sport-utility buyers won't drive home in your all-wheel drive station wagon, which is dressed up like an SUV, because it looks too 'wagony'?  If you're gutsy like Subaru, you put a taller, more squared-off body on your wagon chassis, and call it good.  The new Forester is a Subaru parts bin exercise, and since the parts bin is rather small at Fuji Heavy Industries, which owns the upstart all-wheel drive automaker, the car is cobbled together from a mixture of Impreza and Legacy bits.Based on the rally-proven Impreza platform, the Forester uses the same AWD system found in other Subaru models.  The 2.5-liter boxer engine comes from the Legacy Outback, and makes 165 horsepower in the Forester.  Torque has been increased for 1999, earning a Stage II designation for this motor.  Forester has more power than its primary competitors, though Suzuki's new Grand Vitara V6 has closed the gap.Also, thanks to its hunkered-down stance, low center of gravity and car-based foundation, the Forester handles better than the Chevrolet Tracker, Honda CR-V, Suzuki Grand Vitara and Toyota RAV4.  The trade-off is lower ground clearance and less capable off-road ability, but you weren't going to go too far off the beaten path anyway, were you?  (Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, know-what-I-mean?)Inside is room for four adults, with a rear center position marked off for a fifth rider in a pinch.  Cargo space is equivalent to what you'd find in the RAV4 or Tracker, and storage room abounds.Three Forester models are available: the base, the mid-level L and the high-end S.  Air conditioning, roof rack, rear defogger, tachometer, power windows, tilt steering, rear wiper/washer, and an 80-watt cassette stereo are standard on the base model.  The L adds antilock brakes, power door locks and cosmetic goodies.  This year, the L's standard equipment list has been expanded to include power exterior mirrors.  With a base price barely over $20,000 when destination charges are included, the L is Subaru's volume seller.  The uplevel S gets a toothy chrome grille, alloy wheels, bigger tires, rear disc brakes, cruise control and upgraded interior trimmings.  New to the S for 1999 is a standard All Weather Package that includes heated seats and exterior mirrors, as well as a windshield wiper de-icer.  Remote keyless entry and leather is optional on the L and S.  Other Forester options include CD player, alloy wheels, cruise control, trailer hitch and a variety of cosmetic upgrades.  All Foresters can be painted in two new colors: Silverthorn Metallic and Aspen White.While we are partial to the Impreza Outback Sport and Legacy Outback models, the Forester will attract buyers who want an inexpensive, functional, all-wheel drive vehicle that looks like a truck and drives like a car.  As long as Subaru can keep a lid on pricing, the Forester should pick up right where the Outback wagons leave off",,210,,all wheel drive , 5-speed manual

The 5300 V8 is now ultralow emission certified (ULEV) for California. For states with less restrictive emission requirements, the Yukon offers flexible fuel capability with the use of cleaner burning gasoline blends. A more efficient starter, more durable steering gear housing and LATCH child seat attachments anchors round out the Yukon's upgrades for 2002. A comfortable and easy-to-drive SUV loaded with premium features. With a spacious interior that has legitimate room for seven, strong V8 engines that provide ample power and a truck-derived chassis that assures long-lasting durability, the Yukon is a versatile package that appeals to active-lifestyle families that need a little bit of everything from their family truckster. Buyers can choose between two different trim levels: base SLE or uplevel SLT. SLEs come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 rated at 275 horsepower, front and rear air conditioning, aluminum alloy wheels and deep-tinted glass. Add to that power windows, locks and doors, a nine-speaker AM/FM CD stereo, and an electrochromic rearview mirror with an integrated compass, and it's easy to see why these are popular SUVs.Step up to SLT trim and you'll enjoy leather upholstery, heated driver and passenger front seats with power lumbar and lateral support, electronic climate control, and the OnStar communications system. All Yukons come with four-wheel disc ABS for short stopping distances and a five-link coil-spring rear suspension that delivers a smooth highway ride. An optional Autoride suspension system varies shock damping automatically as needed, and 4WD models can be equipped with a Z71 off-road package that includes protective skid plates and a high-capacity air filter. Front and side airbags are standard, and an optional traction control system keeps the 2WD Yukon's tail planted in the slippery stuff.A four-speed automatic is the only transmission available in the new Yukon, but an optional 5.3-liter V8 engine is available if you need the extra torque for towing. Other extra cost items include a power sunroof, locking rear differential, rear-seat audio controls and polished aluminum wheels. One of the great things about the Yukon is that it gives you plenty of interior room and luggage capacity in a garageable daily-driver package. Despite its full-size SUV status, it delivers an enjoyable highway ride while remaining manageable in tight quarters. With third-row seating, you can have the practicality of a minivan and the go-anywhere capability of an SUV in one easy-to-live-with package.

Bmw,bmw 3-series,2023,bmw 3-series 2023,"['Polished handling', 'Tastefully modern interior with plenty of room', 'Powerful and fuel-efficient engines']","['Infotainment system can be complicated to use', ""Most of the 3 Series' advanced driver assist features aren't standard""]",,"The  seventh-generation BMW 3 Series has been on sale for a few years, which means  it was time for BMW to give it a feature  refresh to keep it competitive against the recently redesigned Mercedes-Benz  C-Class. We knew a styling update would be in the picture for the 2023 BMW 3  Series and feared the beaver-toothed grille from the 4 Series and M3/M4 would  transition to the mild-mannered luxury sedan, too. Thankfully, BMW hasn't  fussed with the exterior too much — the grille is slightly wider than  before, the headlight cluster no longer has the little notch in the middle, and  the front and rear bumpers feature sharper angles, giving it a more modern  look. 
There  are significant changes to the interior, however. For starters, the 12.3-inch  digital instrument panel and central touchscreen now share a singular curved  housing running BMW's latest iDrive 8 software. The new software makes the BMW  Intelligent Personal Assistant smarter, with improved natural language voice  recognition and additional features, including the ability to open and close  the windows or the sunroof through verbal commands. Finally, the central screen  is upgraded to measure 14.9 inches — nearly double the size of the  previously standard 8.8-inch screen — and once again offers touch  functionality. 
BMW  has also streamlined the center stack control layout. There are almost zero  dedicated physical controls for the climate system. Instead, these functions  are moved to the touchscreen in a climate menu, though the driver and passenger  temperatures are always displayed. We're not huge fans of making  attention-sapping touchscreens even more convoluted, but at least you can use  the car's voice recognition system to change the temperature. The useful set of  eight preset buttons, which can be configured for anything from radio stations  to navigation destinations and specific menus, also disappears. Lastly, the  shift lever has been replaced by a toggle switch. 
All  these changes make for a compelling entrant into the compact luxury sedan  segment, but the 3 Series will face stiff competition from the redesigned  Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the stylish Audi A4 and the up-and-coming Genesis G70.  Read on for our thoughts on how the updated 3 Series fares. If  you have a spot to plug it in, the BMW 330e is our recommendation. It's price isn't much higher than the base 3 Series, yet  it comes equipped with a plug-in hybrid powertrain supplying an estimated 23  miles of pure electric driving before switching to gas-electric hybrid  operation. And models manufactured in North America may qualify for a federal tax credit and potentially other incentives  (for new-car buyers); these incentives could actually make it the least  expensive 3 Series.",Inline 6 cylinder ,280," 368 lb-ft @ 1,800 ",all wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

Passenger side airbag shut-off switch is a nice nod toward making this truck safer for kids.']",['Extended cab models lack a third door and the redesigned front end is a bit too swoopy.'],4.6,"The 1998 four-wheel-drive Tacomas receive fresh front-end styling that makes them more closely resemble their two-wheel-drive brothers. A new option package appears for 1998 as well; the TRD Off-Road Package for extended cab models is offered. On the safety front, Toyota introduces a passenger-side airbag that can be deactivated with a cut-off switch, making the Tacoma somewhat safer for children and short adults. Toyota also offers a new Tacoma PreRunner for 1998, billing it as a two-wheel-drive truck with four-wheel-drive performance. Toyota's sixth-generation compact pickup debuted as a 1995.5 model with an actual model name: Tacoma. It's supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure. Any of three potent engines go under the hood.  Toyota aimed for aggressive styling, inside and out, and Tacomas sport an excellent selection of interior fittings. Regular and extended cab bodies are available, with either two- or four-wheel drive. A freshening of the front end occurred on the 1997 two-wheel drive Tacoma and the 1998 four-wheel drive models follow this year. Swoopy fenders, a larger bumper, aero-style headlamps and a new grille set this truck apart from its forebears.  Two-wheel drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated at 142-horsepower. Tacoma 4x4s earn a 150-horsepower, 2.7-liter four. Toyota claims that its four-cylinder engines are comparable to V6s from competitors. If those won't suffice, however, consider the V6 option: a dual-overhead-cam, 24-valve unit that whips out 190 horses and 220 foot-pounds of torque. With V6 power, borrowed from the bigger T100, this compact pickup can tow up to 5,000 pounds and soundly trounce most factory sport trucks in the stoplight dragrace.  All Tacomas have front coil springs instead of the former torsion bars, but 4x4s feature longer suspension travel to improve ride/handling qualities. Manual-shift trucks feature reverse-gear synchronization to reduce gear noise when shifting into reverse. Four-wheel antilock braking is optional on all Tacomas, and all pickups contain dual airbags with a shut-off switch for the passenger's side. In top-of-the-line Limited pickups, a One-Touch Hi-Four switch is available for easy, pushbutton engagement of four-wheel drive.  Tacomas are produced at the NUMMI joint-venture facility in Fremont, Calif., having been designed in that state. Options include cruise control, air conditioning, a sliding rear window, tilt steering wheel and moonroof.  The 1998 Tacoma PreRunner, however,  is set to attract truck buyers who desire but cannot afford a 4WD truck, 4WD truck owners who don't use their 4WD as often as they expected and 2WD truck buyers who take their vehicle off-road. Historically, a ""pre-runner"" is a truck that pre-runs an off-road race course. Toyota's new PreRunner has benefitted from considerable suspension tuning and development work with Toyota Motorsports  desert racing truck program to produce a 2WD vehicle with 4WD capabilities.  Stylistically, the PreRunner is identical to the other 1998 4WD Tacoma trucks, but the PreRunners are only available as XtraCab models with four- or six-cylinder automatic transmissions.  Special details on the PreRunners include a double-wishbone independent suspension with coil springs, a 1.02-inch stabilizer bar and hydraulic shock absorbers.  Standard tires are 15- by six-inch steel wheels and P225/75R15 mud and snow tires.  The Toyota Racing Development off-road package offers Bilstein shock absorbers, locking rear differential on six-cylinder models, alloy wheels and other off-road enhancements.  Toyota  hopes to attract buyers with the style and image of their Tacoma as well as a lower price tag.  We like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents. Most of these Toyota trucks don't come cheap.  Guess that's the price you pay for the peace of mind a Toyota provides.",Inline 4 cylinder ,190," 160 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Other changes include making the locking tailgate standard on XLT and Lariat trims, optional on XL and Standard models. Foglights become optional this year on all four-wheel-drive models except for the Lariat, which gets them standard. An STX package featuring 17-inch tires, aluminum wheels and color-keyed grille debuts as an option for the XLT 2WD. The Lariat receives a color-keyed steering column, leather-wrapped steering wheel and outside power signal mirrors. Silver Metallic paint replaces Silver Frost paint, and Light Denim Blue replaces Portofino Blue. When Ford introduced the new family of F-Series trucks in 1996 as a 1997 model, there was an uproar among old-school Blue Oval fans.  Gone were their beloved Twin-I-Beam suspensions, pushrod engines and traditional styling.  The new model appeared with a short- and long-arm front suspension, overhead cam engines and more swoops than a Dairy Queen sundae.Now that the vehicle has been out for two years, naysayers have put their fears to rest.  The SLA suspension provides excellent on- and off-road articulation, giving the most demanding drivers the best ride  available in any truck.  Overhead cam engines provide capable acceleration and enough power to tow Rhode Island to the West Coast.  The swoopy exterior means that parking an F-Series truck in a crowded parking lot may be a bit of a challenge, but the outstanding visibility it gives when off-roading more than makes up for its somewhat sissified shape.The Ford F-Series' interior is also a breakthrough.  Stepping out of one of the competitive vehicles, like a Chevy or Dodge, and into the F-Series is like going from a Yugo to a Lincoln.  All of the Ford's hard edges have been softened, and the interior materials are not something that one would expect to see in  a vehicle meant for a hard day's work.  When put to the test, however, the Ford's interior can stand up to  the rigors thrown at it by the meanest of foreman and orneriest of ranch hands.  Until this vehicle came onto the scene, ergonomic and truck were not words that we were likely to use in the same sentence.  The positioning of the F-Series' controls, however, make this vehicle easier to drive than many midsize sedans.Our main gripe about the new F-Series is its overly twitchy steering and the tall step-in on the four-wheel drive model.  Not too much to complain about, if you ask us.After driving several F-150s, it appears that Ford has taken a path designed to bring more personal-use  buyers into the Ford fold without alienating truck buyers who work their pickups hard.  Styling, always a subjective point, might turn potential buyers off with its free-flowing forms and smooth contours.  We, however, like its clean lines and lack of clutter, particularly around the grille.  If you are in the market for a full-size pickup, you need to see why the F-150 has been the best-selling truck on the market for the last decade.  Ford redefined excellence when it introduced its latest full-size truck; the others are still trying to catch up.  Chevrolet will be coming out with a new model for the 1999 model year, but we don't think that there will be any serious competition for Ford's F-Series trucks until then.",V6 cylinder ,150," 255 lb-ft @ 3,000 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed manual

But the A8, at least in its standard V6 form,  doesn't provide the same kind of driving thrills that put class leaders over  the top. The 2020 Audi S8 aims to dial in a bit more fun, starting with a stout  turbocharged V8 engine.  While  the standard A8 is available with a turbocharged V8, its 453-horsepower output  is no match for the S8's 563 . According to Audi, it takes the A8 4.5 seconds  to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph with this engine. Selecting the S8 reduces the  sprint time to just 3.8 seconds. The S8 receives other performance upgrades,  including standard all-wheel steering and a road-reading suspension, plus a  sport differential not offered on the A8 at all. Inside, the S8 is equipped  with features that are optional on other A8s. The  2020 Audi S8 should satisfy your needs if you're in the market for a high-tech  executive sedan with a little more pep than the A8.  There's only one S8 trim, so picking an S8 largely comes down to selecting how many option packages you'd like. Considering the S8's flagship status, we think the Executive and Driver Assistance packages are must-haves — the former adds blind-spot monitoring and the latter adds advanced driving aids.

In an effort to mold its image into that of a serious, first-rate automobile manufacturer, Hyundai has recently added standard equipment and enhanced the performance of several of its cars.  The improved Accent and all-new Sonata are proving that this South Korean automaker has finally learned how to build a good car.  This year's Elantra provides even more proof, and the company offers an industry-leading warranty program to back it up.  Called the Hyundai Advantage, the new buyer assurance program is a great incentive to buy a Hyundai over one of the many other compact choices on the market.  With the purchase of any Hyundai vehicle, consumers will receive an awesome 10-year / 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.  If the car is sold within those first 10 years, the new owner will still be entitled to a 5-year / 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.  Also part of the program is 5-year / 100,000-mile corrosion coverage and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty for 5 years or 60,000 miles.  Additionally, the program offers free 24-hour roadside assistance for five years, which includes towing and lockout service.Potential Elantra buyers can choose sedans or wagons in Base or GLS trim levels.  New under the hood of the Elantra is the 140-horsepower, 2.0-liter DOHC engine that powers the Tiburon and replaces the Elantra's previous 130-horsepower, 1.8-liter engine.  Riding on a four-wheel independent suspension, the Elantra features smooth, stable handling.  A speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system communicates improved road feel to the driver. Designers fiddled around with the Elantra's exterior this year, restyling the front end with a bold new grille, sleek hood lines and a larger air intake opening.  New headlights feature a multi-focus reflector system and the Elantra gets revised turn signal lamps.  The rear gets reengineered taillights and a restyled optional spoiler, while the car's midsection adds waistline molding and new five-spoke alloy wheels.  Inside the Elantra, consumers will find a new dashboard layout, rotary-type climate controls and a steering wheel that uses a low-weight magnesium core for greater strength and durability.  To enhance ride comfort, front seat backs have been slightly widened.  Dual airbags are standard on the Elantra, housed in a two-piece dashboard designed to reduce squeaks and rattles.  Adjustable headrests and seatbelt anchors are standard, and all models come with driver's side lumbar support and seat height adjustments.  Extensive use of sound deadening materials helps quiet this compact car.The five-speed sedan includes air conditioning, five-mph bumpers, rear window defroster, dual remote control mirrors, rear seat heating ducts, intermittent windshield wipers, remote fuel and trunk releases, cassette stereo, tilt steering column and speed-sensitive steering.

For nearly two decades, the Ford F-Series has been the best selling pickup truck in the United States.  For more than half that period of time, it's been the best selling vehicle, period.  Understandably, Ford execs were a bit hesitant to completely overhaul their Golden Child.  After all, the F-Series, which hadn't seen substantial engineering improvements since 1980, seemed to be selling just fine as it was.  Reality was, though, that deadlines for some stringent truck standards were approaching fast, and the F-Series was getting long in the tooth.  The redesign was approved.Five million development miles later, Ford introduced a radically new F-150 in January 1996.  The bold look, passenger car accouterments, overhead cam engines, and short and long arm front suspension of the new pickup are either embraced or shunned by die-hard Ford truckers used to the traditional styling, bare bones interior, rugged pushrod motors and Twin-I-Beam suspension of the 1996 model.  So what about this new truck?  Overall length is up for all models, and SuperCabs provide substantial improvements in rear passenger leg and hip room.  SuperCab models feature a third door as standard equipment, as more and more full-size pickups are purchased for personal use.  Styleside and Flareside cargo boxes will be available for both cab styles.  Dual airbags are standard, and the passenger side restraint can be switched off in the event that a rear-facing child safety seat has been installed.  The new F-150 meets 1999 side-impact standards for trucks, and a four-wheel anti-lock braking system is optional across the board.  New options include leather seats, a six-disc CD changer, and an anti-theft system.Two engines will initially be available, followed by a third in the fall of 1996.  A 4.2-liter V-6 is the standard engine, and it makes 210 horsepower at 5000 and 255 foot-pounds of torque at 3000 rpm.  That's more than GM, Dodge or Toyota.  The optional 4.6-liter V-8 isn't much more powerful, it just provides its power at more useful revs: 210 horsepower at 4400 and 290 foot-pounds of torque at 3250 rpm.  The third engine is a 5.4-liter V-8 which makes 235 horsepower and 330 foot-pounds of torque.  Tune up intervals occur every 100,000 miles thanks to platinum-tipped spark plugs.  Equipped with the 4.6-liter V-8, the F-150 2WD Regular Cab equipped with an automatic transmission and a 3.55 rear axle ratio will tow up to 7,200 pounds.  Sixteen-inch wheels are standard; optional are big 17 x 7.5J rims shod with meaty P265/70R-17SL tires.Sounds good to us.

Furthermore, even the base  Q3 comes loaded with lots of desirable equipment, so value turns out to be  another core strength.

The subcompact Audi Q3  crossover is a new face for American shoppers.
On the other hand, the Q3 is hardly the freshest face in  this segment, even though it debuted on our shores just last year. Audi's been  building it since 2011 overseas, which explains why it comes with the company's  outdated proprietary music interface rather than USB connectivity like newer  Audi models. The Q3's turbocharged four-cylinder engine is also an earlier  design, as is its six-speed automatic transmission. Consequently, the Q3 is actually  slower than the larger, heavier Q5 2.0T, which gets an eight-speed automatic  and more power, while EPA fuel economy is a wash between the two.
Of course, the Q3 is also significantly cheaper than the Q5,  but there are similarly priced subcompact luxury crossovers that offer  comparative advantages. The biggest option you should check out is the fully  redesigned 2016 BMW X1, which  boasts a larger cabin and cutting-edge technology along with superior  performance and fuel economy. The Lexus NX 200t is neck-and-neck with the Audi  in terms of space- and fuel-efficiency, but it pulls ahead with quicker  acceleration and standard USB integration. Then there's the even smaller but pleasantly  frugal and highly customizable 2016 Mini Countryman,  which is more engaging to drive and can be outfitted with spunky turbo power. In  sum, the Edmunds ""C""  rated 2016 Audi Q3 still merits consideration if you're drawn to its  sophisticated style, but otherwise, this little crossover may be less of a big  deal than you'd think. Every  2016 Audi Q3 comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine rated  at 200 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque. It's matched to a six-speed  automatic transmission and either front- or all-wheel drive.
EPA-estimated  fuel economy for the 2016 Audi A3 checks in at 23 mpg  combined (20 city/29 highway) with front-wheel drive and 23 mpg combined (20/28) with all-wheel drive.
In  Edmunds testing, a Q3 Quattro accelerated to 60 mph in 8.0 seconds, a slow time  compared to direct rivals like the X1 and NX 200t. Standard safety equipment for the 2016 Audi Q3 includes  stability and traction control, front side airbags, side curtain airbags, front  and rear parking sensors and a rearview camera. The Technology package adds a blind-spot  monitoring system.
During Edmunds braking testing, an all-wheel-drive Q3 came  to a stop from 60 mph in 122 feet, about average for the segment.
In crash tests conducted by the independent Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety, the 2016 Q3 received the highest rating of ""Good""  in the small-overlap frontal-offset, moderate-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and roof strength tests, while the Q3's seat and head restraint  design was also rated ""Good"" for whiplash protection in rear impacts. In the real world, the 2016 Audi Q3 may seem peppy enough, especially  if you put the transmission in its more aggressive Sport mode. Still, the Q3's  tepid full-throttle acceleration puts it near the back of the pack, which is  unusual for an Audi these days. On the bright side, the engine itself is quite  refined, seldom drawing attention to itself and remaining vibration-free even  at high rpm.

It looks sporty, but the  Audi Q3 is pretty slow for its class.
Over broken pavement, the Q3 delivers a controlled yet  supple ride. The steering is light and can feel rather numb, but it's  adequately precise. When pushed harder around turns, the Q3 exhibits substantial  body roll and doesn't feel as responsive or fun as we'd expect from the Q5's  baby brother. Note that the optional Sport package does not include any  suspension upgrades, so every 2016 Q3 will have the same soft underpinnings. That  said, overall composure is still respectable, and most folks will likely find  the Q3 affable and easygoing in everyday driving. Even  though this is the most affordable Audi crossover, the cabin doesn't skimp on  quality. The Q3 employs many of the same materials and design principles as any  other modern Audi, and the result is one of the finest interiors in its class. In  fact, the cockpit's design theme is more sports car than sport-utility, as it  features a center stack canted toward the driver along with large primary  instruments and various metallic accents.
Most  of the Q3's controls are fairly straightforward, but the climate controls are  located inconveniently low on the center stack, in front of the gear selector.  Also, the multifunction control knob for the MMI system lives on the dash,  which takes a bit of getting used to and can make for an uncomfortable reach. Another  drawback is the absence of a USB port and even a basic auxiliary input jack --  it'd be a surprise in virtually any 2016 vehicle, let alone a premium crossover  from Audi. Instead, you get the company's strange proprietary digital music  interface that requires a special adapter cable for USB connectivity and fails  to provide rich feature integration like most USB-enabled interfaces.

The Audi Q3 can hold a fair amount of stuff as long as  you lower the rear seats.
Although  the front and rear seats are plenty comfortable thanks to their firm,  well-shaped cushions, the rear compartment is rather tight for taller folks. At  31.1 inches, rear legroom is considerably less than the 36.1 inches the Lexus  NX 200t provides, for example. As for cargo capacity, it's a mixed bag. Behind  the rear seats, there are 16.7 cubic feet of available space, a paltry figure  that's nonetheless in line with the Lexus. Fold down those seats, however, and  the Q3 provides a reasonably roomy 48 cubic feet. 
Standard  features on the Premium Plus include 18-inch wheels, a panoramic sunroof, xenon  headlights, LED running lights and taillights, automatic headlights and wipers,  roof rails, front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, keyless ignition  and entry, leather upholstery, eight-way heated power front seats (with four-way  lumbar), a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate  control, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a 60/40-split-folding rear seat,  Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, Audi's MMI (Multi Media  Interface) control system with a pop-up 7-inch display and a 10-speaker  sound system with satellite radio, a CD player and Audi's proprietary digital  music interface.
Optional  for the Q3 Premium Plus is a Technology package, which includes a navigation  system, Audi  Connect telematics (comprising enhanced Web-based navigation and  information services along with WiFi hotspot capability), a color trip computer  and a blind-spot monitor.

We're fond of the 2016  Audi Q3's upscale interior. The MMI tech interface is dated, though.
The  Prestige starts with all of the above and adds 19-inch wheels, LED headlights, ""S  line"" styling cues, a power liftgate, heated auto-dimming and  power-folding exterior mirrors, a 14-speaker Bose audio system and stainless-steel door and tailgate sill plates.
There  are only a few other options for the Q3. A Sport package adds Audi drive select  (adjustable drive modes for steering and transmission), paddle shifters and  front sport seats with extendable thigh support. Wood inlays and a black cloth  headliner are optional on both trim levels, while the Premium Plus can be  equipped with the Prestige's 19-inch wheels and power liftgate.",,150," 207 lb-ft @ 1,700 ",all wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

It has almost as much interior room as a minivan but provides a lot  more capability. Available in front-wheel or all-wheel-drive configurations,  the Pilot comes standard with a strong V6 engine that helps it tow up to 5,000  pounds and is built tough enough for some light off-roading. At the same time,  its comfortable and feature-packed cabin provides a near-luxury experience for  as many as eight passengers. And, unlike some competitors, there's enough room  behind the third-row seat for their luggage and other belongings. Although the Pilot remains a top choice  in this class, there are a few minor issues that potential buyers should  consider. Some of the active safety features, such as adaptive cruise control,  are set up to err on the side of caution, making them seem oversensitive. We're  not particularly fond of the way the optional nine-speed transmission shifts  either. But despite these quibbles, we highly recommend a test drive in a Honda  Pilot if you're looking for a roomy, comfortable, reliable three-row family  vehicle.Notably, we picked the 2018 Honda Pilot as one of Edmunds' Best Midsize SUVs for 2018 and Best Family SUVs for 2018.
What's it like to live with?
With a spacious cabin, exceptional comfort and a tremendously roomy cabin, the Honda Pilot is the quintessential three-row crossover. As soon as we got behind the wheel of this newest model, our editors universally agreed: The Pilot was the best of the bunch. We immediately reached out to Honda and secured a fully loaded Elite model for our long-term test fleet. Over the course of a year and 25,000 miles, we drove our Black Forest green tester to Las Vegas, Sacramento and Oregon. Usually, it performed the commuting duties typical of a family-friendly SUV. To read about our experiences, read our long-term Pilot test. Note that while we tested a 2016 Pilot, all of our observations still apply to the 2018 model. With a strong V6 engine and a roomy, comfortable interior with seating for up to eight, the 2018 Honda Pilot is a leading pick for car shoppers looking at three-row midsize crossover SUVs. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2016 Honda Pilot Touring w/Navigation and  Rear Entertainment System (3.5L V6 | 9-speed automatic | FWD).NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the Honda Pilot received some minor revisions,  such as the addition of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility in 2017.  Our findings remain broadly applicable to this year's 2018 Honda Pilot,  however. The Pilot has plenty of power, but you have to dig deep into the pedal to make it move quickly. At full throttle it shifts decisively, and you can also manually control shifts with the nine-speed transmission. It hit 60 mph in 6.9 seconds, which is a solid number for a vehicle of its size. In daily use, the Pilot's brakes provide solid braking power and an easy-to-modulate pedal. In our testing, simulated-emergency stopping distances from 60 mph ranged from 117 to 120 feet, which is shorter than average. Though there's relatively good precision from the Pilot's steering wheel, there's little road feel. On winding mountain roads, it's steady and predictable. What partially hurts the score in this category is its lane keeping feature, which can be very intrusive in long, sweeping corners. No three-row SUV is light on its feet, but the Pilot feels more nimble than most. It swaps lanes confidently, and its stability control remains at bay during moderately aggressive driving. Overall, handling is above average for the segment. Some low-speed indecision and rough shifts from the nine-speed transmission are very noticeable to the point of intrusion. But the problem is largely at low speed and low load. Nail the gas and the Pilot moves out — sometimes spinning its tires from a standing start. Two-wheel-drive Pilots can handle little more than dirt-road duty. All-wheel-drive models, however, offer active center and rear differentials that redistribute power to the wheels that need it most, making the Pilot surprisingly capable on snow, sand and mud. The wide seats with compliant but supportive backs and bottoms provide hours of comfort. The adjustable inner armrests are a bonus, as is power operation and lumbar support. The Touring model we tested came with heated seats up front and a second row that slides and reclines. Body motions are well-controlled but not at the sacrifice of ride comfort. Big bumps affecting all four wheels can surprise the Pilot, but smaller obstacles don't seem to disturb the ride as much. It's a segment leader in this category. Levels of tire and wind noise are low, especially for a Honda product. The door sealing is very good, and during our tests, we didn't observe any unusual rattles or squeaks. Passengers remain compartmentalized from the outside elements, even over significant surface changes. The infotainment controls are improved over an older, multifunction knob design, and there's an attractive high-resolution touchscreen. The lack of physical knobs for some features is disappointing. Also, the push-button shifter for the nine-speed automatic transmission takes some getting used to. The large doors and modest seat heights make the Pilot an easy vehicle to enter and exit. Third-row access is enhanced with a single-button release for the tilt-and-slide second row, but the pass-through space into the rear is small. The Pilot's highly adjustable front seats and tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel make it easy to find a good driving position. The driver's seat is mounted a bit high for shorter drivers, but otherwise it's a comfortable setup for most. Both the first and second rows are very roomy with good elbow room, leg- and headroom for all but the biggest occupants. Third-row seating is close-coupled with a low seat bottom and a high floor. But there's still enough room for adults on short trips, which some competitors can't manage. For such a large vehicle, there's average front- and rear-quarter visibility. The upright seating gives a better view than you'll get in the Honda Odyssey minivan. The multiview backup camera is handy, while optional front and rear parking sensors reveal hidden obstacles. The quality of materials and assembly is high for a three-row SUV in this segment but not substantially better than what you'll find in competitors. Soft-touch plastics on the dash combined with high-gloss trim and matte-finish secondary controls look and feel good. Everywhere inside the cabin you'll find numerous storage compartments for small items. Up front, a cavernous center console sits between the front seats, and big cupholders are everywhere. Bring all your small items — the Pilot has space for them. It might not measure up against a few cavernous minivans, but the Pilot is still near the top of the three-row SUV segment in terms of total cargo space. The fold-flat second and third row are extremely useful for big items, and there is generous storage under the rear load floor for extra luggage. At 3,500 pounds, the 2WD Pilot we tested has a towing capacity lower than that of most V6-powered three-row SUVs. All-wheel drive does bump the Pilot's towing capacity up to 5,000 pounds, which is more in line with the capabilities of its competitors. Though some controls in the Pilot are reasonably intelligent and intuitive, the active safety features err on the side of caution and can be intrusive. Also, the lack of a volume knob is a frustrating omission that you have to deal with on a daily basis. The 2018 Honda Pilot is available  in five well-equipped trim levels designed to suit a wide variety of buyers. We  recommend the EX-L model for its  combination of practicality, comfort and features. Standard equipment on this  trim includes a leather-trimmed interior, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  compatibility, a sunroof, a power tailgate, heated front seats and one-touch  sliding second-row seats. It also has the standard six-speed automatic  transmission, which we much prefer to the finicky nine-speed gearbox that comes  on higher trim levels. For basic family transportation, the base LX Pilot makes a lot of sense. It  might be the entry-level trim, but it definitely isn't bare-bones. Standard  features include a 3.5-liter V6 engine (280 horsepower, 262 pound-feet of  torque), a six-speed automatic transmission, 18-inch alloy wheels, air  conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and a 60/40-split folding  third-row seat. Technology features include a 5-inch central display screen, a  seven-speaker sound system, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, an auxiliary audio  jack and a USB port.If you're looking for a few more tech and  safety features, then you should probably step up to the EX. It adds automatic headlights, foglights, LED running lights,  heated mirrors, remote engine start, the Honda LaneWatch blind-spot camera,  dynamic guidelines for the rearview camera, three-zone automatic climate  control and a power-adjustable driver seat. Also included with the EX is an  Intelligent Traction Management system (adds a Snow mode for the  front-wheel-drive version and Snow/Sand/Mud modes with AWD), an 8-inch  touchscreen interface, HondaLink smartphone-enabled features, and an upgraded  seven-speaker sound system with two additional higher-powered USB ports,  satellite radio, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, and Pandora  internet radio control. Although much of its equipment is the  same as in the EX, the EX-L gets  several creature comforts that make it worth a closer look. It adds a sunroof,  a power tailgate, a noise-reducing windshield, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel, leather upholstery, one-touch sliding second-row seats, a  power-adjustable front passenger seat, heated front seats and an auto-dimming  rearview mirror. It also keeps the six-speed transmission, which is a big part  of why we recommend this trim level.For some added safety, the EX and EX-L  trim levels both offer the optional Honda  Sensing package. It adds adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning  and mitigation (with automatic braking), road departure intervention, and lane  departure warning and intervention. The EX-L can also be equipped with a  navigation system or a rear entertainment  system that includes a Blu-ray player with a single overhead screen, HDMI and  RCA ports, two additional USB ports for the second row, second-row sunshades  and a 115-volt power outlet. Note that these EX-L options cannot be combined  with each other.Near the top of the Pilot lineup is the Touring model, which has all of the  EX-L's standard and optional equipment plus roof rails, 20-inch wheels, a  nine-speed automatic transmission, automatic engine stop-start, additional  noise-reducing acoustic glass for the windows, front and rear parking sensors,  driver-seat memory settings, ambient interior lighting and a 10-speaker sound  system. The Touring is appealing, sure, and much of the equipment is useful,  but the nine-speed transmission isn't as easy to live with as the six-speed.Swinging for the fences, the  top-of-the-line Elite model adds LED  headlights, automatic high-beam headlight control, a full blind-spot monitoring  system with rear cross-traffic alert (which replaces LaneWatch), automatic  windshield wipers, a panoramic sunroof, heated and ventilated front seats,  heated second-row captain's chairs (which reduce maximum seating to seven  people), a heated steering wheel and HD radio.",V6 cylinder ,190," 262 lb-ft @ 4,700 ",all wheel drive , 6-speed automatic

Options are shuffled as well, making it easier to choose the car you want.  GT models get a slight boost in power. The Ford Mustang has been around for 34 years.  After receiving a dramatic redesign in 1994, and the 4.6-liter modular V8 in 1996, the Mustang design team has been quietly preparing for a freshening in 1999 and a total redesign in 2002.  Changes to this year's model are limited to additions to the standard equipment list, thus making the Mustang a better value for 1998.  That's OK, Ford's pony car has been outselling the competition from GM by nearly a 2-1 margin since its redesign.We think that it's a good idea for Ford to take a year off from messing with things on their little hot-rod.  With all of the other changes taking place with the rest of their models, some of which haven't been well received, it seems like a good idea to follow the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" rule.  Of course, there are some things that we would like to see happen with the Mustang.  First, it would be nice if the Base and GT models gained a few horsepower to make it more competitive with the GM pony cars.  Second, we would like to see traction control made available on the GTs and Cobras.  Sure, they have Traction-Lok or limited-slip axles, but it is pretty darn easy to get the back end of the car pointed in the wrong direction.  We think that a brake/engine speed traction control system would make this car much friendlier in wet weather conditions.Speaking of friendly, we love the Mustang's interior, and think that it is the main reason that the Stang sells more models than Camaro and Firebird combined.  The seats sit fairly high, giving drivers an outstanding view of the road; the dashboard has a nice two-toned, double bubble layout that is nicely textured; the gauges and controls are easy to view and manipulate; and the front bucket seats offer great lateral support.  We won't dwell too much on the back seat, because no one in their right mind buys a sports car for rear seat room.As you have undoubtedly read, the Mustang is a very driver friendly car, very easy to navigate around town and pretty forgiving on the freeways.  We like its lively tail, but it can be disconcerting when traveling on twisty two-laners.  If you are looking for a car to go canyon storming in, you may be more satisfied in a Chevy Camaro.  In the final analysis, though, the Mustang has the goods that most people want.  A nice interior, supportive seats, aggressive styling and decent performance at a competitive price.  It has long been Ford's recipe for success to provide cars that appeal to a wide range of people, and anyone looking for a fast, fun daily driver should take a look at the Mustang.",V6 cylinder ,190," 215 lb-ft @ 2,750 ",, 5-speed manual

There's also a minor styling update inside and out, along with a standard 6.5-inch touchscreen audio interface and a rearview camera for the Limited trim. Front-seat side airbags are now standard across the lineup. Although this year's new six-speed automatic transmission improves the driving experience, the 2014 Jeep Compass still falls behind most other small crossovers in performance, fuel economy and overall refinement. Compact crossovers have to cover a lot of ground. They need  to be able to carry your mountain bike at a moment's notice. They need to offer  enough all-terrain capability to get you to work during a snowstorm. They need  to be roomy and comfortable for you and a couple of kids. They need to offer a  semblance of style along with a decent number of tech features. Yet for all  that, we're not willing to pay that much for them. The 2014 Jeep Compass is an  example of a budget crossover that tries to check every box while keeping the  bottom line low.
First off, it's a Jeep, and Jeeps are known for  off-road supremacy. The Compass does have quite a bit more all-terrain  capability than most other compact crossover SUVs, but that only comes about  when you add some extra-cost features. And even if so equipped, it's a good bet  you'll be calling your friend with a Wrangler to pull you out of a ditch if you  attempt anything really challenging. And so like most other small crossovers,  the Jeep Compass is mainly intended to give you enough traction and ground  clearance to get to work after a snowstorm.
This year's new six-speed automatic transmission is a  welcome replacement for last year's continuously variable transmission (CVT) on  most versions of the Jeep Compass. When paired with the 2.4-liter engine, it improves  both acceleration and fuel economy. That said, the 2014 Compass still feels rather  slow in normal driving, and gas mileage remains below average with the new  automatic transmission. Moreover, persistent engine drone and tire noise make  for a noisy cabin, and the Jeep rides harshly over bumps and ruts.
With so many capable rivals in this class, it's certainly  worthwhile to explore all your options. If enhanced off-road capabilities in a  small crossover are a must-have, we'd suggest taking a look at the similarly  priced 2014 Subaru XV Crosstrek.  For the majority of crossover SUV owners who rarely, if ever, leave the  pavement, the 2014 Ford Escape, 2014 Honda  CR-V and 2014 Mazda CX-5 are  some of the best choices in this class. If up-front cost is your main concern,  the 2014 Nissan Rogue Select (the renamed old-generation version of the Rogue) has  a low starting price like the 2014 Jeep Compass but it offers a much better  overall package. On the front-wheel-drive Sport and Latitude trim levels, the  2014 Jeep Compass is outfitted with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that  produces 158 horsepower and 141 pound-feet of torque. From here, three  transmissions are available. A five-speed manual transmission is standard for  the Sport, while a six-speed automatic or a CVT are optional. The Latitude has  the six-speed automatic as standard. The CVT is a required option on Sport and  Latitude models with the Altitude and High Altitude packages.
The EPA estimates fuel economy at 26 mpg  combined (23 mpg city/30 mpg highway) for a front-wheel-drive Compass with the  2.0-liter engine and a five-speed manual. With the six-speed automatic, mileage  falls to 24  mpg combined (21 mpg city/28 mpg highway), while the CVT version rates 24 mpg combined (22 mpg city/27 mpg highway).
Optional on the front-wheel-drive Sport and Latitude is a  2.4-liter four-cylinder that produces 172  and 165 lb-ft of torque. This  engine is standard on all-wheel-drive models (which Jeep calls four-wheel drive)  and all Compass Limited models.
Equipped with the 2.4-liter engine and the five-speed manual,  the front-drive Compass is rated at 25 mpg combined (23 mpg city/28 mpg highway). Add the six-speed automatic and you're looking at 24 mpg  combined (21 mpg city/28 mpg highway). With four-wheel drive and the 2.4-liter  engine, the 2014 Compass is rated at 25 mpg combined (23 mpg city/28 mpg highway) with the manual and 23 combined (21/27) with the six-speed  automatic.
The optional Freedom Drive II Group provides a more serious 4WD  system with low-range gearing and hill-descent control, but requires that you  also select the 2.4-liter engine and CVT. With the CVT, fuel economy is quite  poor at 21  mpg combined (20 mpg city/23 mpg highway).
In Edmunds testing, an all-wheel-drive 2014 Jeep Compass  with the 2.4-liter engine and six-speed automatic transmission went from zero  to 60 mph in 9.4 seconds, which is an average time for this class. Standard safety features for all 2014 Jeep Compass models  include antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front-seat side  airbags and side curtain airbags. A rearview camera is included with the  Limited trim and available on others. The Freedom Drive II Off-Road group adds  hill-descent and hill-start control.
In Edmunds brake  testing, the Compass came to a stop from 60 mph in 121 feet, which is average  for this class of vehicle.
In government crash  testing, the 2014 Jeep Compass received four  out of a possible five stars for overall crash protection, with three stars  for frontal crash protection and five stars for side crash protection. Regardless of which  engine you choose, the Compass is not especially quick or invigorating to  drive. Unquestionably, the new six-speed automatic transmission improves  performance on models with the 2.4-liter engine. Even so, 2.4 versions  of the 2014 Jeep Compass feel rather underpowered in normal driving in spite of  a class-average 0-60-mph time. The engine makes its best power at higher revs,  so the automatic transmission's frequent (and often slow) shifts can be  bothersome when you're passing at highway speeds or merely trying to maintain  speed on uphill grades. Equipping the Compass with the CVT results in downright  sluggish acceleration and forces you to plan well ahead for passing maneuvers. 
Making matters worse is a persistent drone from the  2.4-liter engine, regardless of the transmission. It escalates to a racket  under hard acceleration, and combined with the Jeep's excessive wind and tire  noise, you'll be reaching for the radio volume knob to drown it all out. Ride  quality is another weak spot, as the Jeep's suspension struggles to cope with  bumps and ruts, resulting in a harsh, bouncy ride over most pavement. This lack  of composure also detracts from the crossover's handling abilities when you're  going around turns. Jeep has upgraded the interior materials in the Compass for  the 2014 model year, and this is  especially noticeable in loaded Latitude and Limited models, which have attractive  stitching and leather work. However, there are still plenty of hard plastic  surfaces, and features like Bluetooth and a USB input, which come standard on  most rivals, remain optional even on the upper trim levels.
Although the seatback cushions might be a little narrow for  larger adults, the front seats are comfortable and offer adequate support for  longer drives. The rear seat is also well cushioned, but legroom is tight for  this class. 
The Compass does sport  some clever features, such as a cooled glovebox, a rechargeable LED cargo light  that pops out for use as a flashlight, and optional speakers that flip down and  out from the raised liftgate to enhance outdoor listening. At 62.7 cubic feet,  the Compass' maximum cargo capacity is respectable. It's considerably more than  the Subaru XV Crosstrek's 51.9 cubic feet and slightly less than the Escape's  66.3 cubes. 
Standard features for the Sport include 16-inch alloy wheels  (17-inch wheels if optioned with the larger 2.4-liter engine), foglights, roof  rails, air-conditioning, cruise control, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, a  tilt-only steering wheel, a 115-volt household power outlet and a four-speaker sound  system with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack. The optional Power Value  Group adds full power accessories, heated mirrors, keyless entry and additional  body-color exterior pieces. The Altitude Edition package adds 18-inch alloy  wheels, a body-color rear bumper, mesh cloth seat upholstery, and heated front  seats.
The Latitude gets the above features as standard (with  smaller 16-inch wheels for front-wheel-drive and 17s for all-wheel drive) and adds  chrome exterior and interior trim, a height-adjustable driver seat, a fold-flat  front passenger seat and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls.  For the Latitude, the optional High Altitude Edition package adds 18-inch  wheels, leather upholstery, a six-way power driver seat (plus manual lumbar  adjustment) and a sunroof. 
The range-topping Limited includes the High Altitude  equipment along with different 18-inch wheels, automatic climate control, a  driver information display, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, a rearview camera,  a 6.5-inch touchscreen display, and HD and satellite radio. The touchscreen  interface is optional on the Latitude and includes an onboard hard drive with  28GB of digital music storage; on the Limited, this music server is combined  with an optional navigation system.
The Freedom Drive II Off-Road group can be added to all four-wheel-drive  trims. It includes 17-inch wheels with all-terrain tires, tow hooks, an off-road  driving mode, an engine oil cooler, underbody skid plates, a full-size spare  tire, hill-descent control, hill-start assist and a height-adjustable driver  seat for the Sport trim.
The Latitude and Limited trims are eligible for the Security  and Cargo Convenience group. On the Latitude this adds the auto-dimming  rearview mirror, a security alarm and the driver information display. The  Limited's version of this option group also includes remote start, a USB input and Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity. Jeep also offers Bluetooth, the USB port and  satellite radio bundled as a separate option for all trim levels.
Also offered on the top trims is the Sun and Sound group (a  sunroof, an upgraded nine-speaker Boston  Acoustics sound system, two flip-down tailgate speakers and satellite radio  for the Latitude trim) and the Trailer Tow Prep group (oil cooler, trailer tow  wiring harness and full-size spare).

An AM/FM/cassette/CD is now available on base models, and is standard on SR5 and Limited models. Daytime running lights are now included with the antilock brake package. A likeable SUV that reminds you, for better or for worse, of its truck-based origins. In 1996, Toyota separated this high-volume SUV from its pickup-truck roots. Thus, the current 4Runner shares little with the Tacoma pickup. As a result, engineers have created a refined vehicle without sacrificing tough off-road ability. In terms of Toyota's lineup, the 4Runner is more expensive than the Tacoma, but less expensive than the Land Cruiser.The interior is quite roomy, and a low floor and wide doors make getting into and out of the 4Runner less of an exercise in contortionism. Gauges are clearly marked and legible. 4Runner Limiteds receive walnut wood inserts on the dash, though this can also be gained on base and SR5 models through an option package. Toyota has thoughtfully provided rear passengers with heat and air conditioning ducts that can be operated independently to adjust fan speed and temperature.There are two engines available on the 4Runner. The base model is propelled by a 2.7-liter inline four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower at 4,800 and 177 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm. Both the SR5 and Limited models receive a 3.4-liter V6, producing 183 horsepower at 4,800 and 217 foot-pounds of torque at 3,600 rpm. While the V6's numbers are acceptable, both the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee have optional V8 engines that produce considerably more horsepower and torque. Suspension-wise, the 4Runner is near the top of the pack. An optional locking rear differential (4WD models only) allows for effortless trips off highway, and the 4Runner is equally at home cruising suburban asphalt, but you'd better like a somewhat harsh ride.Overall, the 4Runner is a nice truck which provides the sophistication that we have come to expect from Toyota products with the overall ruggedness more often associated with Jeeps. Prices are high, however, running from approximately $22,500 for a 2WD four-cylinder base model to over $37,000 for a fully loaded Limited. This lands the top 4Runner right smack dab in Mercedes-Benz ML320, Lexus RX300, and Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited territory. The competition in this segment is getting fierce and there are plenty of good choices for your money, definitely something worth considering when shelling out such a large chunk of change.",Inline 4 cylinder ,340," 177 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Additionally, all cars receive minor styling revisions to the grille and rear fascia, as well as in the cockpit. People buy BMWs for a variety of reasons.  BMWs carry an obvious panache that tells the world that you have, indeed, arrived.  Driving a BMW also tells the world that you are a person who is young at heart, someone who may want to change their own gears from time to time; unlike, say, a stuffy owner of a Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, or Cadillac.  Lastly, BMWs politely tell people that you like to drive, and to please move out of that left lane so you can pass, thank you.The BMW 3-Series is now in its sixth year of production.  Despite this, the car is still fresh and exciting; evoking powerful feelings of desire and jealousy every time we see one cruising down the street.  Last year, new engines were introduced to the entire lineup, improving torque for both the four- and six-cylinder models.  This year, the M3 sedan makes its way to these shores, and all models receive standard All-Season Traction.  Other changes for 1997 include minute styling alterations to the interior and exterior. The 3-Series is BMW's most popular line of cars because it spans such a broad price range.  Starting at just over $20,000 for the fun and cheap 318ti hatchback, the 3-Series reaches its pinnacle at nearly $40,000 with the outstanding, high-performance M3 coupe and sedan.  Despite the disparity in prices, the 3-Series models are uniformly fun to drive due to their wonderful chassis, excellent steering, and top-notch suspensions.  We believe that the purchase of  a 3-Series car is one of the best ways to get know that twisty stretch of road that you were always afraid to introduce to your Buick Century.  If you have the guts and the money, the new 3.2-liter M3 sedan just might be your cup of tea.  This is definitely not the car for all people, back seat room is cramped and the limited cargo space make it impractical for large families.  But, if you are a person who enjoys driving, the 3-Series is a nice alternative to muscle car machismo.  We are thrilled that BMW has exercised restraint in these times of overblown excess.  By keeping their revisions to those things that need revising, leaving the core of the vehicle untainted, the 3-Series is able to improve itself, instead of replace itself, every few years.",Inline 6 cylinder ,195,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

New exterior colors include Forest Green and Desert Sand, to match the most common Cherokee surroundings. Some things never change, and the Jeep Cherokee is one of those mainstays. Unlike its posh-and bigger-Grand Cherokee brother, which keeps adding comforts and graceful touches, the ever-practical, affordable Cherokee simply keeps on rolling, looking little different now than when it was first introduced in 1984.Utilitarian and upright it is, but with a compelling personality that even the Grand Cherokee lacks.  Four adults fit inside the Cherokee in reasonable comfort, with adequate headroom.  Rear legroom is lacking, due to a short seat, and a narrow door constricts entry to the rear.  Worth noting is the fact that the rear bench folds but doesn't offer a split, meaning you can't haul a toddler and a treadmill simultaneously.Relatively comfortable on the road, the compact Cherokee is capable of strutting its stuff when the going gets rough.  Acceleration is brisk with the 4.0-liter, inline six-cylinder engine, courtesy of 190 horsepower and 225 foot-pounds of torque.  We highly recommend this upgrade if you select the SE model, which comes with a measly 2.5-liter four-cylinder that pumps out 65 fewer horses.  The Cherokee's 4.0-liter engine puts the sport into sport utility.The Cherokee is offered in three trim levels: SE, Sport and Classic.  SE and Sport models can have two or four doors, while the step-up Classic edition is four-door only.  All are available with either two- or four-wheel drive.  Command-Trac part-time four-wheel drive allows shift-on-the-fly operation.  Selec-Trac is Jeep's full-time four-wheel drive system, and is not available on the SE.

Hyundai's new industry-leading buyer assurance program is also worth taking note of. This car is a pleasant surprise from Hyundai.  The Accent is an in-your-face declaration from this Korean manufacturer that the days of selling shoddy, inept vehicles in the United States are over. The Accent is one of the better subcompacts in today's market.However, you've got to pay for excellence, and the Accent is among the more expensive subcompacts.  In contrast, a Chevrolet Metro sedan is a tad less pricey than the Accent.  There is a reason for this: The Metro doesn't come standard with such niceties as power steering, rear window defogger, cargo area lighting, remote releases for the fuel door and trunk or digital clock.  Additionally, the Accent benefits from single-piece side stampings, which contribute to stiffer body rigidity, and a 92-horsepower engine that far outranks the top-line 70-horse motor provided in the Chevy.  Is the Hyundai worth the additional money over the Metro?  Absolutely! The Metro feels a bit roomier, but the Accent offers more equipment and feels more solidly constructed than the tinny Chevrolet.Unfortunately for Hyundai, another South Korean automaker has entered the U.S. market, expanding rapidly during the past couple of years.  Kia builds the Sephia sedan, and it is larger and more powerful than the Hyundai.  Starting in 1999 Hyundai has a secret weapon: its new buyer assurance program, called ""The Hyundai Advantage.""  With the purchase of any Hyundai vehicle, consumers will receive an awesome 10 year / 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.  If the car is sold within those first 10 years, the new owner will still be entitled to a 5 year / 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.  Also part of the program is 5 year / 100,000-mile corrosion coverage and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty of 5 years or 60,000 miles.  Additionally, the program offers free 24-hour roadside assistance for five years, which includes towing and lockout service.

The 2007 Chevrolet Express Cargo is pretty much the only option if you're in the market for a traditional full-size van that doesn't look and drive as if it were designed two decades ago. Having been around for more than four decades, Chevy's full-size van lived through the '70s, '80s and half of the '90s via sheet metal changes and updates to the running gear. Still, it rode on the same basic platform that it had had since the swinging '60s until a complete frame-up redesign took place in 1996. To celebrate the rebirth, the van's name was changed to ""Express."" A new exterior look, new engines, extended body styles and improved ergonomics soon made the Express hard to overlook when compared with Ford's dated Econoline. A number of important under-the-skin changes took place for 2003, including a wider selection of V8 engines, the first-time availability of all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements -- all of which went a long way toward making the Chevrolet Express safer and more capable than ever before.As the variant meant almost exclusively for contractors and businesses, the 2007 Chevrolet Express Cargo provides immense cargo and payload capacities -- about 253 cubic feet and nearly 3600 pounds, respectively, in the 3500 model. It also comes with less standard equipment than the already spartan passenger-van version of the Express. This means that it's pretty inexpensive in stock condition but customers will likely want to consider some of the available optional features and job-specific packages to tailor the van for their needs. Given the Express' superior driving dynamics and newer design, we usually recommend it over the aged Econoline. Those seeking an alternative to the traditional domestic vans might want to check out the Mercedes-Benz-designed Dodge Sprinter. The standard engine on rear-wheel-drive 1500 models is a 4.3-liter V6 rated at 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A flexible-fuel 5.3-liter V8, with 295  and 335 lb-ft of torque, is standard on AWD 1500 and optional on two-wheel-drive 1500-series vans. Heavy-duty 2500 models come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 rated at 285  and 295 lb-ft of torque. A 6.0-liter V8 rated at 300  and 360 lb-ft of torque is standard on the 3500 and optional on the 2500. Also available on 2500 and 3500 series vans is a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8 with 250  and 460 lb-ft of torque. All 1500s use a four-speed automatic transmission, while 2500 and 3500 series vans get a heavy-duty version. Trailer capacities range from 5900 to a stout 10,000 pounds, depending on the model. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes are standard on all models. Light-duty models (GVWR less than 8600 pounds) feature a front-passenger-sensing system that will deactivate the front airbag if it senses a small adult or child sitting up front. Heavy-duty models use a manual airbag deactivation switch for the front passenger. A stout frame and rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) give the Express a leg up on the Ford Econoline when it comes to ride and handling. Although the 2007 Chevrolet Express Cargo is still far from nimble, its modern running gear makes day-to-day driving a much more enjoyable experience. The brakes require less effort than those of the Econoline, and the powerful engines really make a difference when it comes to merging and passing when the van is loaded up. The interior of the Chevrolet Express Cargo is built for functionality and not much else. The controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver. A number of job-specific interior configurations can be ordered to tailor the van's cargo area to one's business. The 2007 Chevrolet Express Cargo (Chevrolet also refers to it as the ""Work Van"") is a full-size van meant primarily for commercial users. The standard wheelbase (135-inch) Express comes in half-ton (1500), 3/4-ton (2500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations, while the extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available on the 2500 and 3500 series vans only. Standard equipment on the Express Cargo includes air-conditioning and a theft-deterrent system but not much else. Option choices include swing-out passenger-side access doors, a sliding passenger-side door, a rear air-conditioner and heater, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel, keyless entry and a CD stereo.

There's a new steering wheel, switchgear, instrument cluster and materials. As a traditional American full-size van, the 2008 Chevrolet Express Cargo (and its GMC Savana twin) is a capable companion for working men and women across the country. Full-size vans like the 2008 Chevrolet Express Cargo are redesigned so infrequently, a redo date of 1996 is practically brand-spanking-new. Having been around for more than four decades, Chevy's previous full-size van lived through the 1970s, '80s and half of the '90s via sheet metal changes and updates to the running gear. Only the Rolling Stones can beat that sort of longevity. Chevy's van assumed today's shape 12 years ago and to celebrate the rebirth, the van's name was changed from Sportvan to Express.A number of important under-the-skin changes took place for 2003, including a wider selection of V8 engines, the first-time availability of all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements -- all of which went a long way toward making the Express safer and more capable than ever before. For 2008, the interior has been updated again with improved interior materials and switchgear.The 2008 Chevrolet Express Cargo still outpaces the even older Ford Econoline and certainly warrants consideration for those in need of a cargo van. Naturally, these attributes are most often needed by small businesses and fleet operators. The European-designed and dramatically more modern Dodge Sprinter is pricier than the Express, but its taller interior and better road manners make it a much better work vehicle overall. The light-duty Chevrolet Express 1500 cargo van comes standard with a 4.3-liter V6 that produces 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. Standard on all-wheel-drive 1500s and optional on rear-wheel models is a 5.3-liter V8 that makes 301  and 325 lb-ft of torque. Heavy-duty 2500 models come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 that makes 279  (258 in models with a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of more than 10,000 pounds) and 294 lb-ft of torque. Standard on the 3500 and optional on the 2500 is a 6.0-liter V8 that makes 323  and 373 lb-ft of torque. Available on both heavy-duty models is a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8 that produces 250  and 460 lb-ft of torque. All Express vans come with a four-speed automatic transmission. Trailer towing capacities range from 6,100 to a stout 10,000 pounds, depending on the model. All models have antilock disc brakes as standard equipment. In frontal-impact crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Chevy Express scored five stars (the highest possible). A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2008 Chevrolet Express Cargo respectable driving characteristics. Although Chevy's van is still far from nimble, it fares reasonably well in day-to-day driving. And with a pair of V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers come easily, even when you're hauling a heavy load. The Express' interior is built for pure functionality, and while it may not be pretty or high in quality, it gets the job done. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but the footwells remain as cramped as ever. Unlike the Dodge Sprinter, there is no tall roof option that allows a normal-sized person to walk upright in the cargo area. Express buyers can opt for 60/40-split driver-side doors or dual sliding doors for easy access to the rear compartment. The 2008 Chevy Express Cargo van is a full-size van meant primarily for commercial customers. The standard wheelbase (135-inch) Express comes in half-ton (1500), 3/4-ton (2500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations, while the extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available on the 2500 and 3500 series vans only.

Also new were roof-mounted speakers that expanded available cargo space in the revised interior, plus an improved stereo system.  The new dashboard, did away with the old angular look, replacing it with an organically swept affair complete with more legible gauges and improved ergonomics.  Nothing has changed since then,Passports are spacious for five inside, and V6 models have a swing-out spare tire that creates even greater elbow room.  The rear seat folds flat, resulting in a long cargo floor, but the clamshell tailgate design makes it difficult to access the back of the cargo area easily.  They are however, better for watching softball games.  Fortunately, the rear glass will open independently making it easier to load small items.Road noise might be a drawback, though the 3.2-liter V6 engine is quiet-running and strong with either five-speed manual shift or the available four-speed automatic transmission.  The 2.6-liter four-cylinder engine, formerly available on the DX model has been discontinued; partially due to poor sales, and to keep the DX from competing with Honda's new mini sport-ute: the CRV.  Passports equipped with automatic transmissions have Power and Winter modes, the latter starting off in third gear to reduce wheel-spin on slippery pavements.  Towing capacity is 4,500 pounds with the V6 engine.Anyone seeking a capable blend of comfortable highway ride and tempting off-road talents could do well to look for a Honda dealer.  However, Isuzu markets a version of the Passport and calls it the Rodeo  The Rodeo tends to be a bit less expensive, and comes with a more comprehensive warranty.

Smaller in size than the Explorer (and dwarfed by an Excursion), the 2001 Ford Escape competes in the same class as the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Its main calling cards are an optional V6 engine and a large interior. One of the benefits of coming late to the party is that when you do arrive, you can make a big splash. That's what Ford is doing with the 2001 Escape.Designed to battle the Honda CR-V, Nissan Xterra, Toyota RAV4 and others of the small-SUV ilk, the five-passenger Escape is marked by a larger interior and a more powerful optional engine. As an added bonus, it's also priced very competitively.These factors position the Escape for tremendous success in a growing market. Developed in partnership with Mazda, Escape comes in XLS or XLT flavors. Base models have two-wheel drive and a 2.0-liter Zetec four-cylinder engine making 130 horsepower and 135 foot-pounds of torque.Burdened with people and gear, a Zetec Escape is bound to be rather weedy. Fortunately, there is an optional Duratec 3.0-liter V6. With 200 horsepower and 200 foot-pounds of torque, it is the most powerful engine in its class. Equipped with the V6 and the standard four-speed automatic transmission, the Escape can tow up to 3,500 pounds. Both the four-cylinder and V6 engines are LEV compliant.The Escape also comes in either two-wheel or four-wheel drive. As opposed to Ford's larger SUVs, the 2WD Escape is front-wheel drive. The 4WD system can be set to either ""4x4 automatic"" or ""4x4 lock"" mode. In automatic mode, power is applied to the rear wheels only when a loss of traction occurs. In the locked mode, the Escape applies power to all four wheels at all times. The Escape does not have a low-range transfer case, however.Sporting rugged good looks, Ford hopes the Escape will appeal to young families and people with active lifestyles. Don't let the outside fool you, though. Underneath, the Escape is more car than truck. The unibody chassis is equipped with rack-and-pinion steering, a four-wheel independent suspension and four-wheel ABS through a front disc/rear drum arrangement. One particularly cool feature is the sturdy roof rack that slides rearward and hinges down to make loading and unloading up to 100 pounds of cargo easy. Attachments for skis and bikes will be available from Ford dealers.Inside, the Escape offers a big allotment of space for passengers and cargo. Rear passengers get 36.9 inches of legroom. With the rear seats removed, The Escape offers 68.5 cubic feet of cargo. Cabin highlights include an optional six-disc in-dash CD changer and a 300-watt sound system, standard air conditioning and optional side airbags.Ford claims affordability and durability were top priorities.

Updates include a redesign of the optional camping/towing mirrors and, for all trim levels, the addition of OnStar, a tire-pressure monitoring system and steering wheel-mounted audio controls. Stability control has also been added to 1500-series models. Also note that Quadrasteer is no longer available.  With its capable suspension, strong powertrains and seating for nine, the 2006 Chevrolet Suburban remains a solid family hauler and tow vehicle. Competitors may offer more refinement and conveniences, but it's still the only SUV in its class available in light- and heavy-duty versions. Introduced way back in 1936, the Suburban SUV is Chevrolet's longest-running nameplate. The original was merely a standard panel van with a few extra seats and windows, but its reputation as a sturdy people mover made it a popular vehicle. Now 10 generations later, the tradition continues as the Suburban is still known as a stout, spacious vehicle that can take up to nine people just about anywhere they want to go.Last redesigned in 2000, the current-generation Chevy Suburban rides on a modern chassis that has all the strength of previous models while providing a more comfortable ride and improved overall performance. A lineup of three Vortec V8 engines is available depending on your needs, and a laundry list of interior options allows you to add as much or as little luxury as you might want. Modern advancements like a stability control system make the Suburban safer than ever before. Although there are a few capable competitors out there, the 2006 Chevrolet Suburban remains the most popular SUV for those looking for maximum passenger capacity and solid towing capability in a comfortable, easy-to-drive package. All 1500 Chevy Suburban models feature a 5.3-liter V8 rated at 295 horsepower and 335 pound-feet of torque mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. 2500 versions can be equipped with either a 6.0-liter V8 rated at 335  and 375 lb-ft of torque or an 8.1-liter V8 that produces slightly less horsepower (325) and 447 lb-ft of torque. A four-speed automatic is standard on all Suburbans. Equipped with the 6.0-liter engine, the Suburban can tow up to 9,900 pounds, while the 8.1-liter engine can pull up to 12,000 pounds when properly equipped. The maximum tow rating on half-ton models is 8,400 pounds. Standard dual-stage front airbags deploy based on crash severity, and a passenger seat safety system can sense the presence of a child riding up front and disable the airbag to prevent injury. Standard on all half-ton models is the StabiliTrak stability control system. Front-seat side airbags are optional, but full-length side curtain airbags are not available. In crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Chevrolet Suburban received four stars (out of five) for protection of the driver and three stars for the front passenger in front-impact crashes. We've always been impressed with the current-generation Chevy Suburban's smooth, comfortable ride quality and easy-to-drive nature. Thanks to a stiff frame and a well-insulated cabin, Chevrolet's big SUV is generally quiet and rattle-free, making it a great long-distance cruiser. The ride of the heavy-duty 2500 models is a little less forgiving for rear-seat passengers, but they're still comfortable enough to be daily drivers.  All Suburban interiors are spacious with solid ergonomics and plenty of creature comforts. There's room for nine if you stick with bench seats; ordering the optional captain's chairs drops capacity to seven passengers. There's a little more plastic than we would like in the cabin, and build quality could be better, but overall it's still a pleasant environment for a family vehicle. The Suburban leads the class in cargo capacity (132 cubic feet) but doesn't offer fold-flat seats as in the Nissan Armada and Ford Expedition. The Chevrolet Suburban SUV is offered in half-ton (1500) and three-quarter-ton (2500) configurations with either two- or four-wheel drive. Four trim levels are available: LS, Z71, LT and LTZ. Standard equipment for LS models includes tri-zone manual air conditioning, cruise control, a driver message center, OnStar, keyless entry, a leather-wrapped tilt steering wheel and an AM/FM/CD stereo. The Z71 adds off-road suspension tuning, leather seating with 10-way power adjustments for the driver and front passenger, Bose audio system and unique trim. LT models add automatic climate control and XM Satellite Radio. The LTZ includes an automatic adjusting suspension, side airbags and power-adjustable pedals.

A brake-wear indicator is now standard on all models. This is our favorite midsize sedan and wagon. Don't make your family vehicle choice without driving one. Volkswagen has been busy in recent years. In between buying up smaller carmakers, designing 12- and 16-cylinder engines, and creating a new line of luxury vehicles, the company has had time to tweak its already excellent Passat sedan and wagon offerings.The base Passat engine is a 1.8-liter turbocharged four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower and an almost lag-free 155 ft-lbs. of torque. While not a race engine, this powerplant offers adequate acceleration and contributes more to the Passat's overall grin factor than one might think, especially when mated to the company's excellent five-speed manual transmission.Stepping up to the 2.8-liter V6 will net you an additional 40 horsepower and 52 more ft-lbs. of torque. The V6 comes standard on Passat GLX models and puts the ""fun"" back in functional with its broad torque band and responsive acceleration. Volkswagen's optional five-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission is also availble on the GLX.Regardless of drivetrain choice, all Passats come with superb steering, handling and braking characteristics. With ABS four-wheel discs standard on all trim levels, an independent front and rear suspension, and perfectly weighted power rack-and-pinion steering, the Passat is one of the most entertaining sedans (or wagons) in the midsize class. Some drivers note a bit too much body roll during canyon runs, but the pay off comes in its excellent overall ride quality.In addition to its mechanical pedigree, the Passat offers up an impressive list of standard features. Items like air conditioning, cruise control, one-touch power windows, power locks, remote keyless entry, a remote trunk release, a full-size conventional spare, side airbags and heated exterior mirrors are included on the base GLS models. GLX trim adds the aforementioned V6 engine, sunroof, heated front seats with driver's seat memory, leather seat coverings and door inserts, variable intermittent wipers with heated jets and an auto-dimming day-night mirror.A runaway success in Europe, the current Passat is making headway here in North America against heavy-hitters like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry and Ford Taurus. Based on a stretched Audi A4 platform and using plenty of Audi parts in its construction, the Passat looks, feels, smells and drives like a more substantial car than its price tag would lead you to expect. Its contemporary styling will wear well into the new century and its solid construction should keep the car feeling new as the miles add up.With Volkswagen expanding into the luxury-sedan, SUV, and exotic sports-car markets over the next few years, they're going to need a solid bread-and-butter model to pay all the upcoming development and marketing bills. We expect the Passat to fill this role and help keep the company afloat during its transitional period. Before rushing out to buy that new Accord, Camry or Taurus, you'd do well to at least test drive a Passat.  ",V6 cylinder ,136," 206 lb-ft @ 3,200 ",, 5-speed automatic

DX models receive new wheel covers, all 1997 Honda Civic trims get 14-inch wheels, and the LX Sedan gets air conditioning. More than two decades ago, Honda introduced the Civic.  It was a small, anonymous, unassuming car, competing in a market saturated by mammoth sedans sporting ornate chrome, garish styling treatments, and acres of sheetmetal.  The producers of these defunct dinosaurs didn't bat an eye at Honda's fuel sipping entry, despite the fuel crisis of 1973.  Big mistake.Since then, Americans have seen four generations of the Civic come and go, each much improved over the previous model, and each becoming immensely popular with consumers.  1996 brought us a new generation; certainly improved by not so much so that we'd consider it revolutionary.  The 1997 Civic isn't much smaller than an Accord.  Available in hatchback, sedan and coupe body styles, Honda has heeded customers who claimed the 1992-1995 Civic was too sporty looking.  A grille was tacked on up front, sheetmetal contours provide a squarish profile, and larger rear taillamps give the Civic a more conservative look.  Sedans, coupes and hatchbacks have been given more individualistic styling themes, with the hatchback retaining honors as most odd among the trio.Dual airbags are part of the package, with antilock brakes standard on EX sedans, and coupe models equipped with an automatic transmission.  HX coupes carry through with a continuously-variable transmission, making it the most exciting Civic offered.  The Civic has few shortcomings, aside from its anonymous personality.  Hondas tend to be on the expensive end of the scale when new, but over time, they are a far better value than most of their contemporaries.  The Civic is no exception to the rule.  It is a car for people who don't enjoy repair garage waiting rooms.  It is a car that holds its resale value better than most of the cars it competes with.  It is a car that easily endears itself to its owner.We think the Civic is a solid buy.  For those who like a bit of spice in their commute, try the EX version of the coupe.  Want a fuel miser?  The HX coupe is your car.  Strict budgets demand a look at the CX, while sedans are aimed more at the creature comfort side of the scale.

Z06 model joins the lineup, Active Handling now standard on all Corvettes. Stunning performance for less than $50,000. Need we say more? If bang-for-the-buck is your priority, nothing can touch a Z06. Nearly 45 years after the 1953 Corvette debuted, Chevrolet introduced the fifth-generation Corvette for 1997. With the addition of a hardtop model to the lineup in 1999, Chevrolet brings forth an ace in 2001 with the race-ready Z06 hard top. Pushrod power -- in the form of a 5.7-liter LS1 LEV-compliant V8 -- motivates the Corvette. Horsepower is rated 350 at 5,600 rpm, while torque measures 360 foot-pounds at 4,400 rpm. Equipped with the standard four-speed automatic transmission, the Corvette will hit 60 mph in a shade over five seconds. Opt for the six-speed manual transmission and you'll cut less than half a second off the trap time. To help reign the power in on slippery surfaces, acceleration slip regulation (a.k.a., traction control) is standard equipment. Placing a check mark next to the Z06 box and you'll be treated to the fastest, lightest and stiffest Corvette to leave the factory.  Backed by a new 5.7-liter LS6 V8 producing a pavement-melting 385-horsepower at 6,000 and a standard issue M12 six-speed manual transmission (with aggressive gearing to increase torque multiplication), the Z06 rips from zero-to-60 in four seconds flat and corners at one full G.Manhole cover-sized four-wheel-disc antilock brakes keep stopping distances short, while massive 17-inch front and 18-inch rear tires contribute to prodigious amounts of road grip. The rubber stays planted well, too, thanks to a fully independent four-wheel SLA height-adjustable suspension. Standard for 2001 on all Corvettes is a second generation Active Handling System (AHS), which keeps the Corvette in line even if the driver isn't. Body panels are still composed of a material other than metal, though no longer fiberglass. Sheet-molded compound wraps around an ultra-stiff structure that features a full-length perimeter frame with tubular steel side rails. A sandwich composite floor with a lightweight balsa wood core damps noise and vibration while making the floor exceptionally stiff. Inside, a dash with analog gauges and intuitive radio and climate controls greets passengers. Luggage space beneath the coupe's rear hatch glass is an incredible 25 cubic feet. Even the hardtop and convertible can tote more cargo than any Corvette in history. Yes, the Corvette is an outstanding effort and competes favorably with the best in the class. Long, low, and lean, the Corvette is certainly attractive. We take issue, however, with the thick truncated tail and the odd-looking air scoops for the front brakes. Still, the Corvette's new shape will wear well into the new century. Don't let the fact that the C5 will swallow two golf bags sway you into thinking this a gentrified sporting coupe.

Ever since its 1991 introduction, the Acura NSX has been heralded by much of the motoring press as the best sports car ever produced. We're inclined to agree.  With its 24-valve V6 engine, all-aluminum body, mid-engine layout and traditionally Honda-correct ergonomics, the NSX is a helluva car.  We'd describe it as ""awesome.""  In fact, the NSX-T is Edmund's pick for Ultimate Sports Car (Ultimate as in ""money-no-object"").To answer critics who claimed that the NSX lacks the gusto of a true supercar, Acura increased the NSX's displacement to 3.2-liters and added a six-speed manual transmission. (Models equipped with an automatic transmission make do with the previous 3.0-liter engine.) The new engine cranks out 290-horsepower and moves the car to 60 mph in about five seconds.  Still, we'd love to see what a V8 would do behind those seats.  But while other cars may be faster, no sports car handles as well as the NSX.But with the Acura's prohibitive price, the competition looks very attractive. Retailing for $84,000, the NSX is not a bargain and is dangerously close in price to the Dodge Viper and the Porsche 911 Carrera. Additionally, a redesigned Corvette, and new roadsters from BMW, Porsche and Mercedes-Benz, are available for roughly half of the price of the NSX.While the future of the NSX is uncertain, we think that it is a car worth considering.

All  Q4 Sportback e-trons now have sporty S line styling as standard equipment. A  larger 11.6-inch touchscreen display is also standard, and the available  head-up display offers an augmented reality upgrade.

Matrix headlights are also available for 2023,  offering customizable light signatures.
The  Q4 Sportback e-tron is a compact electric luxury SUV, and within the Audi  lineup, it overlaps with the Audi Q5 Sportback. The two SUVs are about the same  size on the inside, but the Q4 is a little smaller on the outside. It's also  more expensive than the Q5 Sportback, which is typical for EVs.

These models go unchanged for 1999. People buy BMWs for a variety of reasons.  BMWs carry an obvious panache that tells the world that you have, indeed, arrived.  Driving a BMW also tells the world that you are a person who is young at heart, someone who may want to change their own gears from time to time; unlike, say, a stuffy owner of a Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, or Cadillac.  Lastly, BMWs politely tell people that you like to drive, and to please move out of that left lane so that you can pass, thank you.The BMW 3-Series is now in its seventh year of production.  Despite this, the car is still fresh and exciting evoking powerful feelings of desire and jealousy every time we see one cruising down the street.  This year, the big news is the addition of a zippy little 6-pot engine for the coupe and convertible.  At 2.5-liters, the new engine makes 28 more horsepower and a whopping 48 more lbs./ft. of torque than the 4-cylinder engine that is still standard on the entry level hatchback and sedan.  Safety is another concern that BMW addressed in 1998, adding standard side-impact airbags to all of the 3-Series coupes, sedans, and convertibles.The 3-Series is BMW's most popular line of cars because it spans such a broad price range.  Starting at just under $22,000 for the fun and cheap 318ti hatchback, the 3-Series reaches its pinnacle at more than $40,000 with the outstanding, high-performance M3 coupe and sedan.  Despite the disparity in prices, the 3-Series models are uniformly fun to drive due to their wonderful chassis, excellent steering, and top-notch suspensions.  We believe that the purchase of a 3-Series car is one of the best ways to get to know that twisty stretch of road that you were always afraid to introduce to your Buick Century.  This is definitely not the car for all people, backseat room is cramped and the limited cargo space makes it impractical for large families.  But, if you are a person who enjoys driving, the 3-Series is a nice alternative to muscle car machismo.  We are thrilled that BMW has exercised restraint in these times of overblown excess.

Some things never change much, and the Jeep Cherokee is one of those mainstays.  Unlike its posh--and bigger--Grand Cherokee brother, which keeps adding comforts and graceful touches, the ever-practical, affordable Cherokee simply keeps on rolling, looking little different now than it did a dozen years ago.  A driver's airbag became standard last year, contributing to the Cherokee's good showing in government crash testing.Utilitarian and upright it is, but with a compelling personality that even the able Grand Cherokee lacks.

Acceleration is brisk with the ""Power Tech"" 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine, courtesy of 190 horsepower, and we highly recommend this upgrade if you select the SE model.

This electric  overture proved the carmaker was indeed ready to make the transition away from  internal combustion, with its potent power and easy-to-drive nature. In typical  Audi fashion, the automaker also offers a more powerful and sporty version: the  e-tron S. 
While  the standard e-tron comes with two electric motors, the e-tron S has three. One  motor drives the front wheels and the other two each power a rear wheel.  Combined, they produce a stout 496 horsepower compared to the regular e-tron's  maximum of 402 . That scoots the e-tron S to 60 mph in an estimated 4.3  seconds, which is a full second quicker than its sibling. More importantly, the  e-tron S benefits from a standard adaptive air suspension that's tuned for  sportier handling — something we wish the supporting e-tron had more  of.
As  good as all of this sounds, the e-tron is held back by one of the most  significant concerns among EV shoppers: range. It's only estimated to go up to  208 miles. That's well below what we expect from contemporary EVs, but we must  acknowledge it's likely enough for most drivers most of the time. Even more  concerning is its price. The e-tron S starts at almost $90,000.
As  enticing as the 2023 Audi e-tron S may be, we suggest checking out the more  accomplished competition. If you're looking for the best in this class, we  recommend the BMW iX.

There are plenty of options to choose from, but you'll have to watch what you order if you are on a tight budget. There are three different trims: base-level CE, mid-level LE, and the top-level XLE. Some of the more notable options include side airbags, traction control, a premium sound system, leather interior trim, and a power moonroof. ABS is standard on XLEs and LEs equipped with a V6 engine.The Camry's 3.0-liter V6 is a fine engine, and it produces 200 horsepower and 214 foot-pounds of torque. Acceleration is solid, and opposed to the Honda Accord or Mitsubishi Galant, the Camry's V6 can be ordered with a manual transmission. Braking is swift and sure with the antilock system, and Camry hangs on well in corners despite rather meek all-season radials.Inside, controls and gauges are laid-out nicely in a flowing dashboard. The switches and stalks all have a solid and proper feel to them. Storage areas are abundant and feature a deep center console, door bins, and dashboard bins. Front cupholders, the feature by which all cars are truly measured these days, accommodate 20-ounce bottles of your favorite beverage. The only negative is that you might find the seats uncomfortable.The Camry works exceptionally well as a family sedan. Fully optioned, the Camry is considerably more expensive than its domestic competitors, but given the Camry's sales success, it seems most Americans consider the Camry to be a worthwhile investment.",,333," 150 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Audi,audi tt,2023,audi tt 2023,['Cheap'],"['Comically small rear seat in the coupe', 'Limited cargo capacity hurts practicality']",,"When  the first Audi TT made its U.S. debut in 2000, it received rave reviews for its  groundbreaking Bauhaus-inspired design and peppy performance. In some ways, it  was a more distinguished alternative to the cute and mechanically related VW  Beetle revival. More than two decades later, the TT has gotten away from its  styling roots but maintains its fun-to-drive nature. 
The  current third-generation 2023 Audi TT is showing its age, though, as it was  last redesigned in 2016. With the public's waning interest in small and sporty  coupes, it seems likely that 2023 will mark the end of the TT line, at least in  its internal combustion form. That means if you've ever wanted one of these fun  little coupes or convertibles, you should act sooner rather than later.
As  much as we like the Audi TT, there are some alternatives worth considering. The  BMW 2 Series is coming off a fresh redesign for 2022 and it's our current class  favorite with stronger performance and a more affordable price. There's also  the BMW-built Toyota GR Supra that is more athletic but less practical. Even  within Audi's own stable, the A3 and S3 are wildly entertaining and more  up-to-date when it comes to technology.  Most drivers will find the Audi TT completely satisfying in its base form. Because there aren't any typical trim levels to choose from, the only real decision to make is whether to add the S Line Competition package. If you're willing to make sacrifices to ride quality and comfort in the name of more responsive handling, it could make sense to pony up for that option.",,300, 258 lb-ft ,all wheel drive , 7-speed automated manual

Chevrolet,chevrolet express,1999,chevrolet express 1999,['Cheap'],"['Odd arched-eyebrow look taillamps spoil otherwise clean design, not as refined as Ford Econoline.']",3.7,"The Chevy Express line of full-size vans now includes a variety of configurations, including the G1500 (1/2-ton), G2500 (3/4-ton) and G3500 (1-ton) series. Two wheelbases (135 inches and 155 inches) are available on 2500 and 3500 models. For '99, all Express vans get automatic transmission enhancements to increase durability and improve sealing, plus depowered dual front airbags. There are also two new exterior paint colors and one new interior shade for the 1999 model year. When Chevy dealers received a brand-new, full-size van to sell in 1996, it marked the first time in 25 years that GM completely redesigned its big vans. The Express comes standard with lots of cargo space, dual airbags and four-wheel antilock brakes, and can be equipped with a variety of powerful engines. With this modern new design, Chevrolet is stealing some of Ford's thunder in the full-size van market. Converters prefer the rugged full-frame construction of full-size vans, because they are easy to modify and can handle a lot of add-ons without degrading stability, ride and handling. Because most full-size vans are bought for conversion into rolling motel rooms, engineers decided to put the Chevy Express on this type of platform. Regular-length models carry 267 cubic feet of cargo, and extended-length vans can haul 317 cubic feet of stuff. Trick rear doors open 180 degrees to make loading and unloading easier. Up to 15 passengers can ride in the extended-length Express, making it perfect for use as an airport shuttle. Other seating options include five-, eight- and 12-passenger arrangements. And G3500s can tow up to 10,000 pounds when properly equipped.For convenience, the full-size spare is stored underneath the cargo floor. A 31-gallon fuel tank keeps this thirsty vehicle from frequent fill-ups, but topping off an empty tank will quickly empty your wallet. Engine choices are sourced from the Chevrolet family of Vortec gasoline motors, or if you prefer, a turbocharged diesel. Available are the Vortec 4300 V6, the 5000, 5700, and 7400 V8s, and a 6.5-liter Turbo-diesel V8. Standard side cargo doors are a 60/40 panel arrangement, but a traditional slider is a no-cost option on 135-inch wheelbase vans.Child safety locks are standard on the rear and side doors of the Express. Handy assist handles help folks climb in and out. Front and rear air conditioning is optional. Last year, all models got a standard theft deterrent system and depowered airbags.Exterior styling is an interesting mix of corporate Chevrolet, Astro Van and old Lumina Minivan. We'll admit the high, rear pillar-mounted taillights are odd-looking, but at least they're functional. They can easily be seen even if the van is operated with the rear doors open. Low-mounted bumpers and moldings make the Chevy Express look much taller than it is. An attractively sculpted body side gives the van's smooth, slab-sided flanks a dose of character, as does the quad-lamp grille arrangement. Two new Chevy Express paint choices arrive for 1999, and one new interior color.Overall, Chevrolet's latest rendition of the traditional full-size van appears to be right on target, giving Ford's Econoline/Club Wagon the first real competition it has faced in years.",,142," 330 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",all wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

It's also one of the most affordable. The Q60 is the coupe version of  the Q50 sedan and has one of the lowest starting prices in the brand's lineup,  just above the QX50 SUV.  
If  the Q60 drove as well as it looks, it'd be a riot to drive. But it doesn't. The  majority of owners will be pleased with how it rides and responds to driver  input, but those wanting a sharp-handling back road carver should look  elsewhere. The Q60's base engine offers plenty of grunt, and the optional Red  Sport 400's power is impressive. Those in colder climates will appreciate the  premium coupe's optional all-wheel-drive system offered on all trims. 
The  Q60 has some stiff competition — rivals include the Audi A5, BMW 4  Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class coupe. The Europeans cost more, but they  also have more to offer. Still, the high value proposition means the Q60  shouldn't be overlooked. The  Q60's Pure trim has an appealing starting price for a premium coupe, but buyers  should opt for the midlevel Luxe trim in order to get more advanced driver aids, heated front seats, a Bose  audio system and leather upholstery (versus faux leather).",,116," 350 lb-ft @ 1,600 ",all wheel drive , 7-speed shiftable automatic 
Hyundai,hyundai sonata,2002,hyundai sonata 2002,['Cheap'],"['Noisy four-cylinder engine, some cheap interior bits.']",4.5,"The 2002 Sonata receives a new look, a refined suspension and an available automanual transmission. The standard features list is lengthened to include such niceties as remote keyless entry and, on GLS and new-for-2002 LX models, 16-inch wheels. In September 2002, Hyundai announced that it had misstated the horsepower ratings for all of the models in its lineup -- the Sonata's 2.4-liter four-cylinder is now rated for 138 , while the V6 is now at 170, the previously advertised 2002 power upgrade (11 horsepower) apparently notwithstanding. To compensate, the company is offering owners (of 2000 models and newer) three options: 10 years of roadside assistance, 6-year/72,000-mile basic warranty coverage or 12-year/120,000-mile powertrain coverage. If you're willing to take a gamble on a non-cachet brand name for your midsize sedan, the Sonata just may pluck at your heartstrings. The Sonata is a thoughtfully designed family sedan that makes for a viable alternative to the more expensive and popular Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Three trim levels are available for 2002: base, GLS and a new top-of-the-line LX. Under the hood of base models is a standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine making 138 horsepower. Buyers can upgrade to a more powerful V6 or get it standard if they spring for either GLS or LX trim. This V6 is an aluminum 2.7-liter motor making 170 horsepower. Sonatas come standard with a manual transmission in base and GLS trim, or can be ordered with a four-speed automatic (standard on LX) that includes a Shiftronic automanual feature. The Sonata offers decent steering feedback, and body roll is kept to a minimum. Road and wind noise are adequately muffled, and the brakes stop the car with confidence. Riding on a front double-wishbone suspension and a rear five-link setup, the Sonata's ride and handling can be characterized as stable, smooth and responsive. Inside the monochromatic cabin are plush seats, an adequate driving position and a nice-looking dashboard. Drivers will also find well laid-out radio and climate controls, a nifty penholder and a leather shift knob on GLS and LX models. The trunk is spacious with an extremely low lift-in height for ease of use, and the rear seats on higher trims fold down conveniently in a 60/40 configuration to expand the cargo area.Standard safety features such as side airbags, seatbelt pre-tensioners and a passenger-presence airbag detection system all contribute to a safer environment in the Sonata. Optional ABS with traction control is offered, as is a power sunroof.Hyundai has one big advantage over most other manufacturers peddling bread-and-butter sedans these days. Aptly called the Hyundai Advantage, the company's warranty program is a great incentive to buy a Hyundai over one of the many other choices on the market. With the purchase of any Hyundai vehicle, consumers will receive an awesome 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, 5-year/100,000-mile corrosion coverage and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty for 5 years or 60,000 miles. Roadside assistance is part of the deal, too, for 5 years and unlimited mileage. Incorporating dependability and cutting-edge style in affordable packaging, Hyundai has come a long way lately, and the Sonata is proof of it. Desirable, safe and well equipped, the Sonata is perfect for hauling the family around town. If you're still not convinced that the Sonata could lure you away from that bare-bones Camry, Accord or Passat you've been salivating over, go drive one.

Jeep,jeep wagoneer,2023,jeep wagoneer 2023,['Cheap'],,,"When  you want your vehicle to be able to tow a big trailer and seat more than five  people at a time, there's pretty much just one option: a large truck-based SUV.  Only a few automakers offer one, but one of the newest entries is the 2023 Jeep  Wagoneer. Coming off its 2022 introduction, the Wagoneer is a prime rival to  the Chevrolet Tahoe and Ford Expedition.  The  Wagoneer is rated to tow up to 10,000 pounds when properly equipped. That's  certainly enough to pull a good-sized recreational or utility trailer. For  people-hauling duty, the Wagoneer's three rows of seating accommodate up to  eight passengers. You can also fold down the second and third rows to open up a  sizable 116.7 cubic feet of cargo space. The Wagoneer has respectable  off-roading capabilities for a large SUV, but for true outdoor adventuring,  you'll probably want something that's smaller and more maneuverable. Besides  the Tahoe and Expedition, and their respective upsized versions (the Suburban  and Expedition), you might also consider the Toyota Sequoia, which is fully  redesigned for 2023. The Wagoneer certainly has appeal within this group,  especially if you want a big and well-appointed SUV that can pull a big trailer. Jeep  hasn't released official information on the 2023 Wagoneer as of this writing.  We'll update our recommendation if anything changes, but based on last year's  SUV, we think the Series II with the  optional Convenience package is the way to go.

The 2000 Acura NSX is an exotic that still turns heads. Overpriced for what you get, though. Buy a used one and get virtually the same car. Well-balanced, highly poised, easy to drive, graceful -- the NSX is a precision instrument that is forgiving enough to make drivers of diverse skill levels feel like pros. The 3.2-liter engine makes 290 horsepower (252 if equipped with an automatic) and moves the car to 60 mph in about 5 seconds. Though largely unchanged from the 1991 introductory model, the current NSX is still a capable ride. The mid-engine design provides excellent weight distribution, keeping the wheels securely planted around turns. Braking is confident and secure with only 122 feet required to get from 60 to zero.Inside, the NSX is as comfortable to drive as the Honda Accord. All controls are logically placed, the seating position is ideal and the targa top is easily stored. While never a strong point of mid-engined exotic sports cars, rear visibility is better than you might expect.Shift action, especially with the revised six-speed transmission, is simply amazing. The clutch and brake pedals are well-placed and provide excellent feedback while the steering is razor-sharp. Where the car fails, however, is in the cost of entry. It's simply too expensive. Costing as much as a three-car garage, complete with a Chevrolet Corvette, Jeep Wrangler and Honda Accord parked inside, the NSX is no bargain.Upon introduction nine years ago, the Acura NSX was heralded as one of the best sports cars ever produced. With its 24-valve V6 engine, all-aluminum body, mid-engine layout and traditionally Honda-correct ergonomics, the NSX was one helluva car. To say that it set a new standard in the sports car segment would not be an overstatement.However, even the NSX is not immune to the effects of time. With the 1994 introduction of the Viper and the 1997 unveiling of the C5 Corvette, both of which are cheaper and more powerful sports cars, the NSX became a questionable value. Even the current Porsche 911, which was recently improved in terms of both luxury and drivability, is a viable alternative to the pricey, and somewhat sterile, NSX.The future of the NSX is not certain, though a more powerful and less expensive version is reportedly in the works. The current model still has plenty to offer. Its rev-happy powerplant makes it appealing for those desiring a supercar, while its livable interior and excellent ergonomics make it practical enough to live with on a daily basis. When pushed hard on a racetrack, it offers Indy car-like stability and responsiveness. And don't forget that Acura build quality and reliability are included with every NSX, making it one of the most stress-free exotics on the market. Unfortunately for Acura, the current Corvette offers 95 percent of the NSX's handling abilities, and 120 percent of its horsepower, for 50 percent the cost.",,134," 224 lb-ft @ 5,500 ",, 6-speed manual

Rear side-impact airbags are now a no-charge option, rather than standard. The 2002 BMW M5 is the king of all performance sedans, a classic for the ages. BMW went and did it. After constantly improving the current 5 Series platform until it was one of the best sport sedans on the planet, it has taken the segment to an entirely new level with the radical M5. If you're already a fan of the 540i, prepare to be mesmerized by Bavaria's top performance sedan.Starting with the 4.4-liter block from the 540i, BMW's M Division bumped displacement to 5.0 liters with a bore and stroke job. Compression is set at 11:1 (requiring the use of premium fuel, of course), and the cylinder heads are redesigned to offer greater crossflow cooling. Outfitted with the requisite double-VANOS variable valve-timing system, this engine is good for 394 horsepower. Even with the M5's 3,800-pound curb weight, 0-to-60 acceleration happens in a lightning-quick 5 seconds! But don't expect those times to happen with both hands on the wheel; the M5's only transmission is a six-speed manual.Along with Corvette-like acceleration, the sedan features a lower ride height than you'll see on a standard 540i, aluminum suspension pieces, stiffer spring and shock rates, and 18-inch wheels with Z-rated tires. A sport mode switch on the center console will recalibrate the variable-assist power steering for increased road feel and snappier throttle response. When things get too snappy, traction control and electronic stability control are waiting to intervene (unless you've switched them off).While paying 70 large for a performance toy might not sit well with the other half, don't forget to mention all the amenities that come standard on every M5 Sedan. Dual-zone climate control, heated leather seats with leather inserts and eight-way power adjustments, power headrests, a GPS navigation system, a 10-speaker sound system, one-touch power windows, rain-sensing wipers, and on and on. Remember, you're not just buying a European hot rod, this car is meant for safe and secure family transportation ... right?You can customize the interior look of your M5 with a slew of no-cost options. Prefer the Nappa Heritage leather to the Nappa Point leather or the bruyere Wood Trim to the burl Wood Trim? Just check the option boxes that appeal to you. You can even delete the rear spoiler to hide your M5's true intentions further. Park Distance Control, a rear sunshade and a rear-seat pass-through are the only extra-cost factory options, though a BMW CD changer is pre-wired and can be dealer-installed for a nominal fee. For 2002, the rear seat side airbags have been removed from the standard equipment list (a nod, no doubt, to parents who worry about injury potential for out-of-position children). However, if you carry only adults in back and desire the extra padding, they remain a no-cost option.The M5 represents BMW's most capable performance car yet. It is an uncompromising sport sedan in terms of both ability and amenity.

New SAE testing procedures drop the MDX's horsepower rating from 265 to 253.

The Acura MDX is meticulously engineered to serve a specific purpose, much like a good set of Craftsman tools. It can seat up to seven people and it offers plenty of luxury accouterments. And since it's a crossover SUV, meaning that it's more of a car than a truck, its unibody construction pays dividends in handling and safety, though like most competitors it has little appetite for serious off-road pursuits. Even in the sixth year of its model cycle, the MDX remains one of the best premium-brand crossover SUVs on the market. But Acura's SUV is not given to whimsy or flair. It isn't a vehicle you aspire to own. This is the one you buy because you need it. The Acura MDX gives you plenty of room for the family, a ride they can all live with, an engine that will move them swiftly and more than enough features to keep them comfortable and safe. The MDX's cabin ambience is more upscale than that of its workaday Pilot sibling, but there's less of the opulence found in other luxury SUVs -- and that's why the MDX costs less. If this is your idea of the perfect premium crossover SUV, the 2006 Acura MDX is your vehicle. While most luxury SUVs offer a V8 as the top-line engine, the Acura MDX comes only with a 253-, 3.5-liter V6. Nevertheless, acceleration is competitive with bigger-engined SUVs and fuel mileage is superior. A five-speed automatic transmission is standard, and it helps the MDX earn an EPA mileage estimate of 17 city/23 highway. Power travels to all four wheels through Acura's Variable Torque Management (VTM) full-time four-wheel-drive system. Tow capacity is 3,500 pounds. The MDX comes standard with four-wheel antilock disc brakes, seat-mounted side airbags for front occupants, head-protecting side curtain airbags, a tire-pressure monitoring system, stability control and three-point seatbelts in every position. Should an accident prove unavoidable, MDX counters with high crash test scores; it scored five stars (out of five) in the government front- and side-impact tests. The IIHS gave the Acura MDX a ""Good"" rating (the highest possible) for its performance in the 40-mph frontal-offset crash test. Comfortable on rough city streets, yet firm enough to feel agile in the corners, the 2006 Acura MDX offers a pleasing compromise between ride comfort and handling ability. On mild off-road jaunts, the MDX is well up to the task of soaking up big hits as well as smoothing out long, winding stretches of bumpy dirt road. Eight inches of ground clearance allows the MDX to clear small obstacles with ease. Perhaps because of its minivan roots, the MDX's interior does little to inspire or awe, but it is quite functional. The second-row rear seats offer ample room, and the third-row seat is fine for children. The spacious cabin also makes the MDX a very practical cargo carrier. The second-row seats are split 60/40, folding nearly flat with one simple latch. The third-row seat is all one unit that folds flat, as well. With both the second- and third-row seats folded down, there's 82 cubic feet of usable space. The Acura MDX is offered as a four-door only in either base or Touring trim. Base models come well equipped with 17-inch wheels, XM Satellite Radio, heated mirrors, keyless entry, leather seating (heated in front), a power driver seat, front and rear automatic climate control, a CD player and a moonroof. Touring models add a roof rack, a rear wiper, a power front-passenger seat, a driver-seat memory feature, a Bluetooth hands-free cell phone interface and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer. Ordering the Touring model also allows you to specify the optional DVD-based navigation system (with voice recognition and a rearview video camera), the DVD entertainment system for rear passengers, or both.",,134," 250 lb-ft @ 3,500 ",, 5-speed automatic

For 2002, Audi has made an in-dash six-disc CD changer standard, and an OnStar telematics system and a tire-pressure monitor optional fare. It has also improved the stability control system and updated the navigation system software. New exterior and interior colors round out the changes. Want to drive the hero car from the movie Ronin instead of the BMW 7 Series or Mercedes S-Class? This is it -- minus the dual-tank nitrous system. Audi is making a dedicated effort toward bringing more performance-oriented cars to American consumers. The S8 is a massaged version of Audi's flagship luxury sedan, the A8. At the heart of the S8 is a five-valve 4.2-liter V8 engine. Its modifications over the standard A8's motor include optimized intake paths, a new two-stage variable intake manifold, revised camshafts and a free-flowing exhaust system. Thanks to these improvements, the S8's engine makes 360 horsepower at 7,000 and 317 pound-feet of torque at 3,400 rpm. Other performance enhancements on the S8 include larger brakes, 18-inch wheels and a stiffer suspension.All of these modifications make the S8 more fun to drive than the A8. This doesn't mean that the S8 has lost any of its real-world edge, however. It is still equipped with a five-speed automanual transmission and quattro, Audi's all-wheel-drive system. Additionally, Electronic Differential Locking (EDL) provides low-speed traction control and Electronic Stability Program (ESP) corrects understeer and oversteer.  Electronic Braking-Pressure Distribution (EBD) is included with the ABS system and ensures that maximum braking capacity can be utilized whenever needed, regardless of road or load conditions.Like the A8, the S8's body structure is constructed of aluminum and is designed to provide lighter weight, superior structural rigidity, improved handling and responsiveness, better fuel efficiency and easier recycling. For safety, the S8 has dual-stage front airbags and side airbags for front and rear outboard occupants. Audi's Sideguard head airbag system consists of inflatable curtain airbags installed in the headliner along each side of the car, which cover the windows in the event of an accident and remain inflated for 5 seconds to protect the head in case the vehicle rolls over.Inside, drivers will find an interior slathered in real wood and Valcona leather upholstery. Front seats (with more supportive bolstering than the A8's seats) are power adjustable in 14 different ways, and a memory feature accommodates four different settings for the driver seat, exterior mirrors, driver headrest height and steering wheel position. An in-dash six-disc CD changer stores all your tunes. The steering wheel tilts out of the way when the key is removed from the ignition. The automatic dual-zone temperature controls employ two sunlight sensors to help maintain accuracy.  With 360 horsepower, the S8 is aimed directly at other high-performance luxury sedans like the Jaguar XJR and the Mercedes-Benz S55. The S8 is shy on torque compared to these cars, but its all-wheel drive, lightweight structure and long list of standard equipment should prove desirable enough to make it a worthy competitor.",,143," 317 lb-ft @ 3,400 ",, 5-speed shiftable automatic 
Lexus,lexus is-500,2023,lexus is-500 2023,,"['Tight rear seats', 'Limited storage and cargo space', ""All-wheel drive isn't offered""]",,"For  the most part, Lexus isn't known for producing performance vehicles. Instead,  it focuses on making comfortable and luxurious cars and SUVs with a few sporty  variants mixed in. Last year brought the introduction of the IS 500, a compact  sedan with a big V8 engine that produces 472 horsepower. That's almost double  the output of the base IS 300. It further benefits from several performance  upgrades, such as a sport-tuned suspension, limited-slip differential, larger  brakes and performance tires. The 2023 Lexus IS 500 returns largely the same,  with only a new Special Appearance package with unique paint, wheels and  interior materials. 
The  IS 500 represents unusual boldness for the rather conservative Lexus brand. The  V8 is an audacious choice when most other luxury sport sedans are transitioning  away from large eight- and six-cylinder engines. The V8 significantly changes  the sedan's character when compared to the supporting IS 300 and IS 350, but it  still lags behind some rivals in the class. The IS 500 accelerates to 60 mph in  4.9 seconds, which is plenty quick for any driver, but the new Mercedes-AMG C  43 beats it by almost a full second.  
The  IS 500 delivers sporty handling, courtesy of a sport-tuned adaptive suspension,  but it's not as engaging as its European competitors. It corners well enough  for most drivers, though, and as a result, it provides a more comfortable ride  quality, especially when compared to the BMW M240i. For these reasons, we think  of the IS 500 as a solid grand tourer rather than a genuine sport sedan. 
Most  drivers will find the 2023 Lexus IS 500's driving dynamics more than adequate,  and more exciting than the typical Lexus. Those with a penchant for performance  would likely find it merely adequate and would be better served by the  aforementioned BMW and Mercedes or the Audi S4. We  recommend stepping up to the Premium trim since it delivers some key upgrades for a reasonable price increase. The  larger infotainment touchscreen, premium audio system and surround-view cameras  system are worth it alone.",,142," 395 lb-ft @ 4,800 ",,
Chevrolet,chevrolet express-cargo,2021,chevrolet express-cargo 2021,,"['Less cargo space than many competitors', 'No high-roof option or available all-wheel drive', 'Dated interior styling and driving experience']",3.6,"The  2021 Chevrolet Express Cargo is a proven utility vehicle that holds its own  when it comes to competitive pricing and strong tow ratings. There's something  to be said about a tried-and-true model. But there's no getting around the fact  that this van is old. It was last redesigned in 1996 and hasn't received a  major styling update since 2003.  
To  its credit, Chevrolet has been making constant tweaks. Most notable for the  2021 Express Cargo models is the new 6.6-liter V8 engine. It makes a stout 401  horsepower and replaces the previous 341- V8. Whether you've got a heavy  payload in back or you're pulling a big trailer, the Express will likely be up  to the task. 
Unfortunately,  the Express lacks the more nimble maneuvering, improved fuel efficiency, and  smarter use of interior space of today's crop of modern vans such as the Ford  Transit and Ram ProMaster. Nor does it offer a high-roof option or available  all-wheel drive, so it's hard to consider the Express as anything but a decent  choice for a no-frills commercial vehicle.  Choosing the right Express Cargo van will depend entirely on your needs. If you need to carry a heavy payload, opt for the 3500 model. We recommend the V8 engine if you will be towing often. If fuel economy is a priority, consider the four-cylinder diesel. Finally, if maximizing cargo space is required, then opt for the long wheelbase.",,160," 298 lb-ft @ 3,900 ",, 8-speed shiftable automatic 
Ford,ford ranger,1997,ford ranger 1997,,"['We wish the base engine were stronger, and that a third door was offered.']",4,"Ford introduces its brand-new five-speed automatic transmission to the 1997 Ford Ranger lineup. Available with the V6 engines, the five-speed automatic is designed to improve the Ranger's acceleration, towing and hill-climbing ability. Whether it's image or utility that attracts you to a compact truck, Ford stands ready to seduce you into its strong-selling Ranger.  Trim levels range from the practical XL through the well-trimmed XLT and STX--all the way to the beguiling little Ranger Splash with its fiberglass Flareside bed, chrome wheels, and lowered suspension.With the optional 4.0-liter V6 engine, in particular, acceleration is impressively brisk, whether from a standstill or when merging and passing.  The base four-cylinder engine can overtax the Ranger when carrying a heavy load.  Automatic-transmission upshifts are crisp and barely noticed, with just a slight jolt under hard throttle, and downshifts deliver only slightly more harshness.  Push-button four-wheel-drive, if installed, is a snap to use.Well-controlled overall, with good steering feedback, Rangers handle easily, corner capably (within limits), maneuver neatly, and stay reasonably stable on curves.  Occupants aren't likely to complain about the ride, either, though it can grow bouncy around town.  Gas mileage isn't the greatest with the big engine and automatic, as expected.Ranger sports a worldwide industry first for safety protection.  An optional passenger side airbag is available, and it can be disabled with the flick of a switch in the event that a car seat is installed in the truck.  New for 1997 is a five-speed automatic transmission; a first for vehicles in this segment.  Ford claims that the new five-speed automatic allows better acceleration, trailering, and hill climbing by their capable Ranger.  Ford also shuffles option packages this year in an attempt to make the 70+ options easier, and cheaper, to order.Seats are firm and supportive, urging you to lean back and enjoy a long haul.  Rangers are all truck, with few pretensions toward any other identity, but can be loaded with gadgets like a luxury auto.

It and its twin, the Chevrolet  Express, have gone largely unchanged for more than two decades, and the Savana  is one of the last truck-based full-size vans you can get. That truck-based  architecture does have substantial towing benefits, but that's about where the  advantages end. This isn't the most comfortable or pleasant van to drive. And  while it does offer two wheelbase options and three available engines, the  Savana lacks the option for a higher roof that will give your passengers the  space to walk around between the seats without having to crouch. 
For  2021, the Savana picks up a 6.6-liter V8 (401 horsepower, 464 lb-ft) to replace  the old 6.0-liter V8. This bigger V8 can tow up to 9,600 pounds, while the  standard 4.3-liter V6 and 2.8-liter diesel engines can tow up to 6,700 pounds  and 6,300 pounds, respectively.
Full-size  vans have taken a big step forward, and even the similarly rugged and  truck-based Nissan NV is more comfortable and has better road manners. Ford's  Transit and Ram's ProMaster offer a healthy range of options, body-style  configurations and more modern tech. There's undoubtedly some appeal in the Savana's tried-and-true design, but overall we suggest checking out the other vans to more comfortably transport passengers. Whether  you get the Savana in its 2500 or 3500 configuration, we'd go straight for the LT. We appreciate the extra standard  features, including the driver aids, and think it just makes the Savana a more  comfortable place to be.

Ford,ford edge,2008,,,"['Questionable brakes, lackluster interior design and materials, low maximum cargo capacity.']",4.6,"The 2008 Ford Edge gets more luxury and convenience features. Highlights include Ford's ""Sync"" system (which allows voice operation of cell phones, PDAs, MP3 players and USB storage devices), an optional power liftgate and a voice-activated navigation system. This year also sees a new Limited trim level, which replaces last year's SEL Plus. Strong acceleration, agile handling, a smooth ride and a roomy passenger compartment give the 2008 Ford Edge major points in the midsize crossover segment. Unfortunately, mediocre braking performance sullies its otherwise impressive credentials. Midsize crossover SUVs are fast becoming the family car of choice. Offering carlike ride and handling along with a more reasonable size and fuel economy than traditional truck-based sport-utilities, these crossovers have found appeal with a wide range of shoppers.Ford's entry for this segment is the Edge. Debuting just last year, the five-passenger Edge boasts handsome looks and a punchy 265-horsepower V6 engine. Inside, the cabin is sufficiently roomy and comfortable for daily use. A third-row seat, an increasingly popular feature for this vehicle segment, isn't available, though its usefulness in competing vehicles is debatable. If you're truly in need of a six- or seven-passenger vehicle, the larger Taurus X is probably a better choice anyway.This year's Edge receives a few new thoughtful features. Among them are the available ""Sync"" system (which allows integrated and voice-controlled operation of all kinds of personal electronics such as cell phones and MP3 players), an optional power liftgate and a voice-activated navigation system. There is also a new Limited trim level and optional 20-inch wheels.Overall, the 2008 Ford Edge is a solid pick for the would-be midsize-SUV buyer. But there are a couple things to note. Its overall cabin design and quality is a step behind many competitors, and in testing we've found that its brakes lack the power we would expect from this class of vehicle. If these prove to be turn-offs for you, models like the Hyundai Santa Fe, Mazda CX-7, Nissan Murano and Toyota RAV4 V6 might prove more appealing. The Edge comes with a 3.5-liter V6 rated for 265  and 250 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission is standard. All trim levels offer a choice of either front-wheel or all-wheel drive. On AWD models, power flows primarily to the front wheels until wheel slippage occurs, in which case nearly all the power can be redirected to the rear.The Edge is quick, with a 0-60-mph time of just 7.4 seconds (front-driver version). Shifts from the six-speed automatic are smooth and well-timed, though we wish there was better manual access to gears. (You're limited to ""D,"" ""O/D off"" and ""L."") Properly equipped, the Ford Edge can tow up to 3,500 pounds, which is average for the segment.Fuel economy estimates for 2008 are a mixed bag, with the Edge's city figure at 16 mpg on the low side, while the highway number of 23 is about average. Those are for the FWD version; the AWD Edge rates 1 mpg lower on the highway. Antilock disc brakes, stability control (with rollover avoidance logic), front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags are all standard. Rear parking sensors are optional on SEL and Limited models.In government crash tests, the 2008 Ford Edge nearly had a perfect sweep. It scored five stars (out of five) for the driver and four stars for the passenger in frontal-impact tests, while it earned five stars in side-impact testing for both front and rear passengers. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, it scored the highest possible rating of ""Good"" in both frontal-offset and side-impact testing. Out on the road, the 2008 Ford Edge is one of the quicker SUVs in its class and manages to provide both sporty handling and a smooth, quiet ride. As with most of its peers, off-roading is not really within its grasp, but equipped with AWD, it should make a fine winter-weather vehicle. Unfortunately, the Edge has one major weakness: its brakes. Pedal feel is solid, but stopping distances are much longer than they should be in panic situations. An Edge we tested needed 152 feet to stop from 60 mph. That's a foot longer than a Ford F-450 Super Duty pickup we tested, and much longer than other midsize crossovers, which tend to stop in the 130s. In contrast to the exterior, the cabin of the Edge is rather ordinary and not smartly designed. The cruise control buttons aren't intuitive to use, for instance, and the center stack air vents don't offer enough movement. Many of the interior materials are of low quality as well. Features like a telescoping steering wheel, numerous storage bins and reclining rear seats ensure long-haul comfort, at least. The optional glass Vista Roof imparts an airy feel. Without the power feature, the Edge's rear hatch can be hard for shorter drivers to close, but cargo capacity is a respectable 32 cubic feet with the backseat in use. Folding down the second row opens up a not-so-flat cargo floor and a max capacity of 69 cubes. That's more than a CX-7, but less than the ""compact"" RAV4 and considerably less than a Murano or Santa Fe. The Limited adds a chrome beltline body accent, heated exterior mirrors, leather upholstery, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, driver-seat memory, a power passenger seat (that folds flat) and a power release feature (""EasyFold"") for the folding rear seats.The SE doesn't offer a whole lot in terms of options. Major options for the SEL and Limited include the Vista Roof (consists of a power front sunroof and fixed rear skylight), a power liftgate, 18- or 20-inch chrome wheels, the aforementioned Sync system, an upgraded nine-speaker sound system, a voice-activated navigation system and a rear entertainment system. Although the factory DVD entertainment system cannot be combined with the Vista Roof, Ford dealers can install a dual-screen system that mounts the displays in the front headrests.

Standard fare includes a 10-speaker premium sound system, car and key programmable memory, dual-zone air conditioning, eight-way power adjustments with memory settings and cruise control with steering wheel controls. All-Season Traction Control (AST), Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and Dynamic Brake Control are standard on all 5 Series cars.Standard safety equipment includes dual-stage front airbags, door-mounted front side airbags and head-protection airbags for front passengers. The optional Rear Side-Airbag package also includes head-protection airbags. Three-point seatbelts at all seating positions, impact sensors that unlock the doors and activate the hazard lights in the event of a serious accident, remote keyless entry, two-step unlocking, coded drive-away protection and a vehicle security system are also standard.

The 4.0-liter PowerTech inline-six engine is standard equipment in all 2001 Cherokees, with the 2.5-liter inline four, along with the SE trim, dropped. The previous Limited trim is also dropped, with the former Classic trim now labeled Limited. All 2001 Cherokees offer child seat tethers as standard equipment. Long overdue for an overhaul, the Cherokee hangs on for one more year before next year's replacement, the Liberty, debuts. Unlike its posh and bigger Grand Cherokee sibling, which keeps adding comfort features and graceful touches, the ever-practical Cherokee simply keeps trudging forward, looking little different now from when it was first introduced in 1984. But that's all going to change with the 2002 model, which sees the first serious redesign of the venerable Jeep model.This redesign was supposed to happen for the 2001 model year, but supplier problems forced Chrysler to delay the new Cherokee until summer 2001 as a 2002 model. The next Cherokee will completely break from the current model's boxy, but functional, styling. Watch for the hip-to-be-square Cherokee to go rounded and bear a striking resemblance to the current Grand Cherokee.Despite the redesign delay, 2001 sees one fundamental improvement to this Jeep's pedigree. Because the SE has been cancelled, the Cherokee nabs the 4.0-liter PowerTech inline six-cylinder as standard equipment in all trim levels, giving the wimpier 2.5-liter inline four the boot. This 4.0-liter makes 190 horsepower at 4,600 and 225 foot-pounds of torque at 3,000 rpm. It also complies with the U.S. low-emission vehicle (LEV) requirements. The PowerTech engine can be mated to a five-speed manual or an optional three-speed automatic transmission.The Cherokee is one of the few SUVs that can actually balance on- and off-road duties. The coil-front/rear-leaf suspension continues to provide a smooth ride, while the Command-Trac (part-time) and Select-Trac (full-time) transfer cases are still around to help buyers escape far beyond the realms where more luxurious SUVs lame out. For buyers who like the Cherokee's style but tend to be city folk, two-wheel drive is still available for 2001.While the Classic name is gone, that model effectively becomes the top-of-the-line Limited for 2001, meaning it was really the Limited that was dropped - got it? Anyway, Sport models come in either two- or four-door versions with standard dual front airbags, an AM/FM cassette player with four speakers, a tachometer, cloth high-back bucket seats, a folding rear seat, 225-series tires on 15-inch steel wheels, a spare tire cover, and a rear window defroster. Top-of-the-line Cherokee Limiteds are available only in four-door configurations and include all of the above, along with a carpeted cargo area, floor mats, power mirrors, a roof rack, a rear window wiper/washer, and 16-inch wheels and tires. Additionally, for 2001, child seat tethers are standard on all Cherokee models.Competition in this segment has heated up in the last few years -- first from Toyota's RAV4 and Honda's CR-V, and more recently from the Nissan Xterra and Ford Escape. Even with its reputation as an off-road romper, the Cherokee is in need of a freshening.

Driving the 2004 Toyota Tacoma is easy enough thanks to its compact dimensions. Both four-cylinder engines offer adequate acceleration, while the V6 has a broad power band and is well suited for towing and off-roading. Ride quality can suffer if the TRD off-road package is ordered, but the payoff in terms of enhanced off-road ability is well worth it. Handling is competent on pavement, and the brakes are strong. The Tacoma's interiors are industrial in design and look dated, but are constructed of high-quality materials. Switchgear is logically placed and easy to use. The seats are generally comfortable, but larger drivers might find them short on room. The 2004 Toyota Tacoma comes in three body styles: Regular Cab, Xtracab and Double Cab. Each is available with two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Toyota also offers Tacomas with a ""PreRunner"" designation. PreRunners are 2WD trucks that have the looks and heavy-duty suspension of 4WD models. The Double Cab is a compact crew cab that offers four full-size doors and a longer passenger compartment for people who want a pickup and an SUV but can't afford both. In order to keep overall length reasonable for on- and off-road maneuverability, the Double Cab's bed length is shortened to 61.5 inches. Toyota also offers a special 2WD S-Runner Xtracab sport truck equipped with the V6, a five-speed manual transmission and a sport-tuned suspension. Standard features are few and far between. On most Tacomas, items like air conditioning, cruise control, bucket seats and power windows and locks are all optional. Toyota does offer two optional packages -- SR5 and Limited -- that bundle the most desired features. A TRD off-road package is also available that includes an upgraded suspension, meaty 16-inch tires and a locking rear differential.",,145," 160 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual 
Subaru,subaru forester,2002,subaru forester 2002,,['Not made for serious off-roading.'],4.4,"Subaru's mini-SUV/tall wagon gains three new standard features: a cargo area cover, daytime running lights and an intermittent mode for the rear wiper. Other changes include a new color for the Forester S' lower body cladding (from Titanium Pearl to Graystone Metallic) and the option of leather seating for S models equipped with the Premium package and automatic transmission. An enjoyable vehicle that can't quite match the versatility of other mini SUVs. With the Forester, Subaru offers a no-nonsense mini-SUV for those who need the versatility of a small wagon with the grip of all-wheel drive (AWD). The Forester's platform is comprised of previous-generation Legacy and Impreza components. This is mostly a good thing, as the Forester rides and handles like a car, not a clumsy truck, and gets gas mileage that won't have you going broke or feeling guilty about rapidly depleting our finite fuel supply. The downside of the Forester's architecture is that it's not meant for hard-core off-road duty, which will probably be a non-issue for 99 percent of the people who would consider purchasing one. Tackling poor-weather driving conditions and getting to the campground or mountain bike trailhead are what the Forester is geared for.  All Foresters come with Subaru's 2.5-liter flat four that pumps out 165 horsepower, substantially more power than its competitors' four-bangers and even more ponies than some other mini-SUVs' V6s. Transmission choices include a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Opt for the automatic and you'll get a smart tranny that knows when to hold a gear to optimize engine braking when descending a hill or prevent hunting between gears when going uphill. A fully independent suspension contributes to the Forester's agility, as does a lower center of gravity than most of its rivals, such as the Honda CR-V and Suzuki Grand Vitara. There are two trim levels in the Forester line: base L and up-level S. Air conditioning, power windows/locks/mirrors, cruise control, antilock brakes and a stereo with cassette deck are all standard on the L. The S ups the ante with 16-inch alloy wheels, rear disc brakes, a six-disc CD changer, heated seats and leather wrapping for the steering wheel, gearshift handle and parking brake handle. If that's not enough luxury for you, a Premium package for the S adds a huge power moonroof, front side airbags, gold accents for the wheels and a monotone color scheme. Want leather seats? You can have 'em as an option, but only on S models with both the Premium package and automatic gearbox. Safety conscious consumers will be pleased to find that in the offset crash test (arguably the most realistic scenario in a collision), the Forester scored the highest rating in its class. Apart from a couple of minor flaws, such as funky upholstery on the L model and minute stereo controls, the Forester is a well-rounded vehicle that offers active folks a fun, safe and functional ride.",,401," 166 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual

As the numbers get  progressively bigger, the trucks get more capable. The 2020 Ford F-450  represents the pinnacle of the non-commercial fleet. Properly equipped, it can  tow up to 37,000 pounds thanks to 1,050 lb-ft of stump-pulling torque delivered  by a next-generation 6.7-liter turbodiesel V8 engine. On  the inside, supportive seats, abundant space, and plenty of features make it  easy to live with the F-450. Hook up your trailer and load up all your heaviest  gear and you'll still have a vehicle that can pamper you on the longest of road  trips. For maximum towing and hauling, though, you'll need the less  accommodating regular-cab configuration instead of the more popular crew cab.You  might not expect it from such a massive vehicle, but the F-450 is available  with many technology and safety features. Infotainment highlights include newly  standard FordPass Connect with 4G LTE Wi-Fi service and available wireless  smartphone charging, while the list of driving aids expands to include  automatic emergency braking. Ford also makes its driving assistance and  collision avoidance tech standard on all F-450s except for the base XL trim.Towing  is the name of this truck's game, and the 2020 F-450 Super Duty adds two  critically important pieces of technology to support that role. The first is  improved Trailer Reverse Guidance, which now works with both fifth-wheel and  gooseneck trailers. The second is Pro Trailer Backup Assist, which is a  semi-automated steering technology that makes reversing a trailer easier. You  do have to pay more for the 2020 Ford F-450 Super Duty compared to other  heavy-duty trucks. But if you need maximum capability, it's pretty much in a  class of its own. Our  recommendation for most F-450 buyers is the XLT trim level. Available in regular-cab or crew-cab configuration,  XLT trim delivers maximum towing and hauling capability combined with most of  the features you'll really want, such as Sync 3 infotainment and Ford's  CoPilot360 safety systems.",,235," 1,050 lb-ft @ 1,600 ",, 10-speed shiftable automatic

After a styling refresh and several upgrades  last year, the Acadia returns in 2021 with only minor changes. From the  affordable albeit modestly appointed base model to the off-road-themed AT4 and  luxurious Denali trim, there's a wide range of Acadias to choose from. The  question is: Should you? 
We  like the Acadia for its smooth ride and optional V6 engine, but its interior  quality doesn't meet expectations for the price. It also comes up a little  short on third-row space and cargo room. As such, we suggest cross-shopping  some of Edmunds' highly rated three-row SUVs such as the Honda Pilot, Hyundai  Palisade and Kia Telluride.  The SLT trim gets our vote because it  has a more powerful turbocharged engine and a lot more standard features than  the SL or SLE. On top of that, it's also eligible for more options. If you plan  on towing, you'll want to get a Denali with its available V6 engine and tow  package.

Ford,ford ranger,2006,ford ranger 2006,,"['Dated platform, weak engines, choppy ride, lack of modern features and amenities, no crew-cab body style or side airbags.']",4.4,"The 2006 Ford Ranger pickup receives revised exterior trim and styling details. Available on both two- and four-door extended cabs this year, the FX4 model now comes with rubber flooring. Lastly, the Edge model has been renamed the Sport. Old, tired and completely outclassed by its competition, the 2006 Ford Ranger only deserves a look if you're content with a cheap price and passable performance. After years of serving as a trim designation on the F-Series pickup, the Ford Ranger became a separate model when it replaced the Mazda-supplied Courier pickup with an in-house design in 1983. The Ranger quickly became the best-selling compact pickup and has dominated the segment ever since.Today's Ford Ranger still rides on the same basic platform and structure as that 1983 original, though substantial revisions for 1989, 1993 and 1998 have kept the Ranger competitive. Demographically, buyers range widely, with Rangers serving for work, play or both. A wide range of trim levels and features makes it easy to configure the Ford truck according to your needs, unless of course you want a crew cab. The Ranger is still offered only in regular- and extended-cab (SuperCab) body styles.After all these years, the Ford Ranger is still a decent truck for light-duty work needs, but competitors offer more spacious interiors and more refined driving dynamics. The Ranger does hold its own off-road when equipped with one of the FX4 packages. The cabin offers a user-friendly control layout, and the seats are acceptably comfortable, particularly with the optional leather upholstery. Out on the road, though, the Ranger's age becomes apparent. Acceleration is adequate on trucks equipped with the 207-horsepower, 4.0-liter V6 engine, but ride quality, handling and braking are at the bottom of the class. Given that many competitors have recently redesigned the compact trucks in their lineups, the Ranger's over 20-year-old design just doesn't cut it anymore. Unless you're a die-hard Ford truck fan, we would recommend taking a pass on the 2006 Ford Ranger. Three engine choices are available on the 2006 Ford Ranger. The base engine is a 2.3-liter inline four with 143 horsepower and 154 lb-ft of torque. Next up is a 3.0-liter V6 rated for 148  and 180 lb-ft of torque. At the top of the engine chart is a 4.0-liter overhead-cam V6 rated for 207  and 238 lb-ft of torque. Properly equipped, a 4.0-liter Ranger can tow up to 5,740 pounds. Transmission choices include a five-speed manual or a five-speed automatic, and most models offer a choice of two- or four-wheel drive. The Ford Ranger comes standard with four-wheel antilock brakes. Side airbags are not available. Two-wheel-drive SuperCabs received four stars (out of five) in NHTSA frontal- and side-impact crash tests. Regular-cab models earned a five-star side-impact rating. The 2006 Ford Ranger pickup is a decent performer when equipped with the 4.0-liter V6, but it tends to feel underpowered with the 3.0-liter V6 or the base four-cylinder, especially if you get the automatic transmission. Rangers are quite capable off-road, especially when equipped with one of the FX4 packages. Ride and handling characteristics on pavement are tolerable, but when driven back-to-back with newer offerings from Dodge, GM, Nissan and Toyota, the Ranger's age shows.  Controls are easy to find and use, and the available white-faced gauges add a little extra style. SuperCabs can be equipped with small jump seats in the rear, suitable only for children or small adults. The 2006 Ford Ranger is available in regular- or extended-cab (called SuperCab) body styles. Regular cabs can be ordered with either a 6- or a 7-foot bed. SuperCabs come only with a 6-footer and can be equipped with reverse-opening rear access doors. Trim levels include XL, STX, XLT, Sport and FX4. The XL is basic -- cloth upholstery and an AM/FM radio are among the few amenities. The STX and XLT are the next step up, and they're your ticket to the Power Equipment Group, which offers keyless entry and power windows, locks and mirrors. The Sport has body-color bumpers, while the XLT gets a more traditional chrome finish. Both have a CD player, but the Sport version is MP3-compatible. A Tremor package gets its name from its 510-watt Pioneer stereo system. Two versions of the FX4 are available: Off-Road and Level II. The Off-Road package includes heavy-duty shocks, skid plates, tow hooks, 16-inch all-terrain tires and a limited-slip rear axle. The Level II gets a Torsen limited-slip differential, Bilstein shocks, BF Goodrich all-terrain tires and Alcoa wheels.",,225," 154 lb-ft @ 3,750 ",, 5-speed manual 
Toyota,toyota tacoma,1997,toyota tacoma 1997,,['Luke-warm about the revised styling.  Dangerously close to full-size truck prices.'],4.5,"The 1997 Toyota Tacoma receives several new value packages that make optioning the truck easier. A locking rear-wheel differential is now available on all 4WD models. Bucket seats can be had on all Xtracab Tacomas this year; not just the SR5. Two-wheel-drive models have new headlamps and a new grille that make the vehicle look more like the T100. Toyota's sixth-generation compact pickup debuted in April, as a 1995.5 model, with an actual model name: Tacoma.  It's supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure.  Any of three potent new engines goes under the hood, and the pickup rides an all-new chassis.  Toyota aimed at aggressive styling, inside and out, and Tacomas sport an excellent selection of interior fittings.  Regular and extended Xtracab bodies are available, with either two- or four-wheel drive.  A deep-sculpted grille/hood/fender structure imparts a sporty personality to the truck, to attract customers who select their 4x4s on non-utilitarian grounds. Two-wheel-drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated 142 horsepower (26 more than the prior generation). Tacoma 4x4s earn a 150-horsepower, 2.7-liter four.  Toyota claims that its four-cylinder engines are comparable to V6s from competitors.  But if those won't suffice, consider the latest V6 option: a dual-overhead-cam, 24-valve unit that whips out 190 horses and 220 foot-pounds of torque.  With V6 power, borrowed from the bigger T100, this compact pickup can tow up to 5,000 pounds and soundly whip any factory sport truck in the stoplight dragrace.  In contrast, the V6 engine available in the prior-generation pickup delivered only 150 horsepower and 180 foot-pounds.All Tacomas have front coil springs instead of the former torsion bars, but 4x4s feature longer suspension travel than before, to improve ride/handling qualities, whether on- or off-road.  Track width has been increased, too, for a more stable ride.  Rack-and-pinion steering replaces the old recirculating-ball layout, for better feel and response.  Manual-shift trucks feature reverse-gear synchronization, to reduce gear noise when shifting into reverse.  Four-wheel antilock braking is an option, but all pickups contain an airbag for the driver.  In top-of-the-line SR5 Xtracab pickups, a One-Touch Hi-4 switch is available for easy, pushbutton engagement of four-wheel-drive.  By redesigning and lowering the floor by 1.6 inches, Toyota makes 4x4s easier to enter.Tacomas are produced at the NUMMI joint-venture facility in Fremont, California, having been designed in that state.  Options include cruise control, air conditioning, a sliding rear window, tilt steering wheel, and moonroof.  We like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents.

Ford,ford explorer,1997,ford explorer 1997,,['The base V-6 engine is a asthmatic when trying to pass at freeway speeds.  The Explorer feels top-heavy in tight corners.'],4,"The 1997 Ford Explorer receives a few appreciated improvements this year.  A new SOHC V6 engine is now available, providing nearly as much power as the 5.0-liter V8.  Also new is a five-speed automatic transmission, the first ever offered by an American auto manufacturer, which is standard on V6 models equipped with automatic. Since its introduction in 1991, the Ford Explorer has resided at the top of the sport-utility sales heap.  With good reason; the Explorer combined style, comfort and room is one go-anywhere package.  The modern day Country Squire, some have called it, after the segment leading station wagon of the 1950s. We think that there's a good reason for this.  Simply stated, the Explorer is a more refined vehicle than the competition at Jeep and General Motors.  The interior instills a feeling of quality that is missing from the Grand Cherokee and the Blazer.  An organically sweeping dashboard houses radio controls that can actually be operated without a magnifying glass.  Materials look and feel rich.  Rear seat comfort surpasses Chevy, and entry/exit is easier than Jeep.  Explorers offer more cargo capacity than most rivals, and five passengers can ride with ease.  Exterior styling is a subjective matter, but we think that the Explorer is one of the most attractive SUVs on the road.  The Explorer's standard 4.0-liter V6 is the puniest engine found in a domestic sport-ute. Acceleration is fine from a standstill, but step on the gas at 50 mph and not much happens. That's not good news when there's a need to pass or merge.  Fortunately, Ford has introduced an optional SOHC V6 that offers nearly as much power as the V8, for a lot less money.  We recommend this engine over the other two engine choices due to its great power and affordable price.Other changes for 1997 include swapping the four-speed automatic for a new five-speed automatic on V6 models.  This five-speed is the first ever developed for an American passenger vehicle.  Ford claims that the additional gear, which occurs between the former first and second gears, allows for more precise shifting, allowing the truck to move uphill and off-road more authoritatively.  When combined with the optional V6, this should make the Explorer much more fun to drive.Unlike the reworked Chevy Blazer, Explorers retain a distinctly truck-like character, which could be a bonus or a demerit. They're tough and solid, and easy to maneuver, though steering is a little slow and ponderous, and the body leans through tight corners.  Braking is excellent, and the suspension has a compliant attitude, but Ford's Explorer can bounce around, making occupants regret the Denver omelet they had for breakfast.Ford has a philosophy of building vehicles that everyone can be happy with.  Sure, the Jeep Grand Cherokee feels sportier, and the GMC Jimmy looks cooler, but the Explorer has just the right amount of class and ruggedness to make it America's best-selling off-roader.  If you are thinking about buying an SUV, chances are you've already checked out the Explorer.  If you haven't, do yourself a favor and find out why there are so many of these trucks on the road.",,275," 225 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 5-speed manual

This new engine is a more viable choice for budget-conscious buyers, and like the V6, it can be matched with a new electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system. Meanwhile, the V6 engine has been tweaked to provide improved throttle response. Antilock brakes are now standard across the line. Interior updates include a floor-mounted shifter, new gauges, upgraded seats and additional storage. The most significant improvement inside is the addition of the optional Safety Canopy rollover protection system. Further, the vehicle's structure has been modified to better absorb offset frontal impacts, and the backseat gets a full set of three-point belts.

The generously equipped Sonata could be just the car to save you from life in a stripped Accord or Camry. And it comes with a super warranty. Hyundai got a fresh start with last year's well-received, redesigned midsize family sedan. The 1999 Sonata offered all-new and highly attractive sheet metal, increased structural rigidity and reduced noise from outside the cabin. Using a supercomputer analysis, engineers were able to develop a rigid, stronger frame without adding extra weight to the car's body. Riding on a front double-wishbone suspension and a rear five-link setup, the Sonata's ride and handling is stable, smooth and responsive. Under the hood of base models is a standard 2.4-liter DOHC engine making 149 horsepower and 156 pound-feet of torque.  Buyers can upgrade to a more powerful V6 or get it standard if they spring for the GLS trim.  This V6 is an aluminum, 2.5-liter DOHC motor making 163 horsepower and 167 pound-feet of torque that peaks at 4,000 rpm, which means power off the line can be a bit lacking.  Sonata V6 sometimes has trouble climbing hills and getting up to speed quickly.  Sonatas can be ordered with automatic or manual transmissions mated to either engine.  Inside the monochromatic cabin are plush seats, an adequate driving position and a nice-looking dashboard. Drivers will also find a leather shift knob, well-laid out radio and HVAC controls, and a nifty pen holder. The trunk is spacious with an extremely low lift-in height for ease of use and rear seats on the GLS fold down conveniently in a 60/40 configuration to expand the cargo area.  2000-model-year Sonatas retain the same base MSRP as last year's models. For an inexpensive car, the Sonata is nicely equipped.  The base model comes with air conditioning, rear window defroster, AM/FM stereo, rear child-safety door locks, power windows, power locks and power mirrors, seven-position tilt steering wheel, tinted glass, halogen headlamps, cruise control and seat-mounted side airbags. The step-up GLS brings with it a 100-watt, six-speaker stereo with CD player, air filtration system, center console with an armrest and storage space, heated side mirrors, upgraded seat cloth, six-way adjustable driver seat, split-folding rear seats and a V6 engine. For the millennium, all Sonatas receive standard 15-inch alloy wheels, and the keyless remote feature is now offered as a $180 option (last year it was free). The MSRP of Sonata's leather package (which includes power driver seat, power sunroof, ABS and traction control) has been lowered significantly, and the cassette/CD stereo is now available only as an option.  Hyundai has one big advantage over most other manufacturers peddling bread-and-butter sedans these days. Aptly called the Hyundai Advantage, the company's warranty program is a great incentive to buy a Hyundai over one of the many other choices on the market. With the purchase of any Hyundai vehicle, consumers will receive an awesome 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty, a five-year, 100,000-mile corrosion coverage and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty for five years or 60,000 miles.

Other improvements include rear-seat heating ducts, quieter-riding P-metric tires, improved automatic transmissions and extended interval service schedules. Daytime running lights are new for 1996. Compact sport-utility vehicles get most of the attention nowadays, but for folks with big families--or scads of goods to lug around--they're just not spacious enough inside.  Chevy dashes forth this year with an answer: a four-door version of the full-size Tahoe, marketed since spring of 1995 alongside the shorter-wheelbase two-door.  That one was formerly known as the K-Blazer, but Chevrolet now restricts the Blazer badge to compact sport-utes, to avoid confusion. At a glance, the four-door Tahoe and Suburban look nearly identical, but a Tahoe measures 20 inches shorter.  That means it's more likely to fit into a normal garage.  Beneath the hood sits a brand-new Vortec 5700 gasoline V8, rated 250 horsepower.  That's 50 more ponies than the 1995 Tahoe.  Aren't you glad now that you had to wait so long to get one?   Two-door Tahoes can be equipped with a diesel instead of the Vortec 5700.Also new for 1996 are rear seat heater ducts, a revised armrest storage compartment with the 60/40 split bench seat, and a new interior color called Neutral.  Outside, daytime running lights have been added, and two new paint colors are available.  Tahoes get new P-metric tires for a quieter ride.  A two-wheel drive two-door Tahoe has been added to the lineup, though we wonder who will buy it.From the driver's seat forward, Tahoes are virtually identical to full-size pickups.  Space is massive up front.  Capable of towing as much as 7,000 pounds, four-door Tahoes seat either five or six, and an underbody-mounted spare tire helps boost cargo space.  The driver faces a new airbag and revised instrument panel.  A passenger airbag is not available.On the Interstates, a Tahoe rides nicely, but the wide body takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to compacts.  Turning onto smaller roads, it suddenly feels more like a truck.  Easy to control either way, the sizable machine is reasonably maneuverable, if driven with discretion.  The V8 is strong, and the four-speed automatic transmission shifts neatly.Think about the ""entry assist"" running boards if your regular riders aren't so nimble.  They help.

With its doors open and beckoning, Honda's stylish and competent family hauler resembles a tall station wagon more than a minivan.  Why?  Because instead of the expected sliding side door--a staple of minivan design from the start--you find that all four side doors swing open, like those in a sedan.  They contain roll-down windows, too.  Naturally, Honda hopes that this unique attribute will help steal sales away from the competition, but a single special feature isn't enough to ensure success in the ferocious minivan market.Fortunately for Honda, Odysseys possess other virtues.  For starters, you get plenty of room for four or five, with a spacious center section that's exceptionally easy to enter.  Either bucket seats or a three-place bench can go there. Not enough? Well, a handy two-passenger bench seat pops out of the cargo floor to expand passenger capacity to seven.  That back bench folds flat very easily when cargo is the priority, and an inside-mounted, compact spare tire takes up very little space.The driver occupies a comfortable position, ahead of a low cowl and steering wheel, and a severely sloped windshield, its base stretched far forward.  Small front quarter windows do little for visibility in that direction, but mirrors are very good.  An unusual slanted dashboard holds a distinctive speedometer.  In addition to a large glovebox and ample console storage box, the Odyssey offers a smaller supplementary glovebox.  On the safety front, airbags are installed for both the driver and front passenger.  So is all-disc antilock braking.Power comes from a VTEC 140-horsepower, 2.2-liter 16-valve four-cylinder engine, borrowed from the Accord.  Adequately brisk performance is accompanied, unfortunately, by an excess of buzziness. If noise is a drawback for you, a V6 choice is likely to arrive soon.

And the 2022 GMC Sierra 3500HD is about as capable as they come. It can pull up  to 35,000 pounds and haul more than 5,000 pounds of payload. You'd have to  search hard to find a load that would outmatch this heavyweight. Only a few  trucks offer the same performance and capabilities as the Sierra 3500HD, and a  couple of them — the Ram 3500 and Ford F-350 Super Duty particularly  — have an edge on the GMC thanks to roomy and more comfortable cabins  with slightly nicer interiors. 
That's  saying something, as the Sierra once held the distinction of being the most  handsome and best-dressed in this category. And certainly in its Denali trim,  the Sierra still impresses as a truck equally at home in the valet line or the  oil fields. The mechanically identical Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD offers nearly  all the same features in a slightly plainer — and cheaper —  truck-ish package. It's a viable option if capability and affordability are  priorities over style. Ultimately, the Sierra 3500HD easily satisfies if you're  looking for a rugged, dashing and massively capable pickup.  Given  the Sierra 3500HD's multiple trims and configurations, it's difficult to pick a  single model. Overall, the SLT probably  offers the best of all worlds, with a good mix of standard features and  available options, yet without the AT4's added off-road hardware or the  Denali's additional expense.

Chevrolet,chevrolet suburban,2010,chevrolet suburban 2010,"['Seats up to nine people, class-leading cargo capacity, lots of standard and optional features, comfortable ride, smooth V8.']","[""Third-row seat is bulky and doesn't fold into the floor, acceleration is sluggish under full load, portly curb weight hampers handling.""]",4.4,"For the 2010 Chevrolet Suburban, the 2LT trim level is dropped, reducing the trims to simply LS, LT and LTZ. There are also a few equipment changes, whose highlights include new audio systems (with a standard USB port) and the adoption of front side airbags. The 2010 Chevrolet Suburban is a compelling choice for those who need a traditional full-size SUV with massive passenger, cargo and towing capacities. We just wonder how many people really do. The 800-pound gorilla within the large SUV segment, the 2010 Chevrolet Suburban is nearly untouchable when it comes to providing an abundance of space and utility. Even in this era of the crossover SUV, the Suburban has stayed true to its roots. It still uses a robust, traditional body-on-frame truck chassis with a solid rear axle and is powered by a large V8 engine. Yet despite its formidable size, the Suburban has agreeable road manners, thanks to its easy steering, compliant ride and hushed demeanor on long freeway cruises.Another thing that hasn't changed is the big 'Burban's thirst for fuel. Despite its V8 engines having cylinder deactivation technology (they can run on just four cylinders under light-load situations), a Suburban will be hard-pressed to average much over 13 or 14 mpg. But in fairness it's no worse than any other large SUV, and for those who truly need nine-passenger seating capacity and acres of cargo space, the Suburban is really only matched by its GMC Yukon XL clone and a few full-size vans.That said, there are a few other considerations in this segment. The Ford Expedition EL boasts similar dimensions to the Suburban and is a bit more versatile, thanks to its fold-flat third-row seats, but it only seats eight and is down on performance compared to the Chevy. There's also the Toyota Sequoia, which has plenty of brawn but not as much room. Overall, those needing massive interior space as well as enough grunt to tow heavy loads will find a lot to like with the immensely capable 2010 Chevrolet Suburban. Chevrolet offers two engine choices for the 2010 Suburban. The 1500 versions come with a 5.3-liter V8 that makes 320 horsepower and 335 pound-feet of torque. On the 2500, a 6.0-liter V8 that pumps out 352  and 382 lb-ft of torque comes standard. Both V8s are matched to a six-speed automatic transmission. With either the 1500 or 2500 model, buyers have a choice of either rear- or four-wheel drive. Properly equipped, the Suburban 2500 can tow up to 9,600 pounds.Combined fuel economy for the 2010 Chevrolet Suburban ranges from about 14 mpg combined to 16 mpg combined, depending on the model and the engine. Obviously, towing and driving with a heavy load can drop these numbers significantly. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes are standard on all Suburbans, as are stability control, GM's OnStar emergency communications system, front-seat side airbags and a three-row side curtain airbag system with a rollover sensor. A blind-spot warning system is also available on the LTZ trim. In government crash tests, the Chevy Suburban was awarded a top five-star rating for its protection of occupants in frontal collisions. Side-impact testing with the new side-impact airbags hadn't been preformed as of this writing, but last year's Suburban still earned a top five-star rating for side-impact protection. The 2010 Chevrolet Suburban is fairly quick for its size and can get to 60 mph in less than 9 seconds. However, the 5.3-liter V8 Suburban doesn't feel nearly so quick when carrying a load of passengers. And with a hefty curb weight ranging from 5,600 to 6,300 pounds, the Suburban, not surprisingly, doesn't feel nimble around city street corners. But the cabin is quiet at speed and the ride is comfortably controlled over bumps. Like other vehicles in GM's portfolio, the Suburban's interior has greatly improved over the years. Materials quality is good and controls are logically laid out. With its standard third row, the 2010 Suburban can seat up to nine people -- a total surpassed only by full-size vans. Although the Suburban's second row is available with a power-folding feature, the third-row seats must be removed manually to optimize cargo space. Based on our experience, those dense seats feel as if they're constructed of cast iron, and removing them requires not only a strong back but the ability to wrestle them out from deep inside the interior.Cargo capacity is immense, as one would expect, with a maximum of 137.4 cubic feet. That's 17 cubes bigger than a Toyota Sequoia and a full 40 cubes larger than a Nissan Armada. The LS comes standard with 17-inch wheels, side assist steps, a 40/20/40-split front bench seat, a power driver seat, full power accessories, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, dual-zone climate control, rear-seat air-conditioning and an eight-speaker audio system with a CD player, auxiliary audio/USB jacks and satellite radio. The LT adds foglamps, luggage-rack rails, a locking rear differential, power front bucket seats, leather upholstery, rear audio system controls with two headphone jacks, additional power outlets (for a total of five), tri-zone automatic climate control, Bluetooth, power-adjustable pedals, remote vehicle starting, rear parking assist and an upgraded Bose audio system with a six-CD changer.The Suburban LTZ gets 20-inch wheels, a power liftgate, rain-sensing wipers, the Autoride rear air suspension, premium leather upholstery, upgraded heated and cooled front seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, power-folding second-row seats with heat and an upgraded 10-speaker Bose surround-sound system.Many of the features that are standard on upper trim levels are available on the LS or LT via packages or individual options. Other major options for the Suburban include 22-inch wheels, a sunroof, a heavy-duty tow package (with an integrated trailer brake controller), an off-road package, a navigation system, a rearview camera, power-retracting running boards and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.",,270," 335 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 6-speed automatic 
Dodge,dodge durango,2003,dodge durango 2003,"['Strong V8 engines, smooth-shifting transmission, excellent ride quality, rugged good looks.']","['Dismal gas mileage, dated design.']",4.5,"Entry-level Sport model gets bigger wheels (16s versus last year's 15s) and all Durangos now have four-wheel disc brakes. Inside, you'll find a six-disc CD changer as a new option. A redesign is due for 2004. A solid sport-ute all around, but a little long in the tooth to call a class leader. Back in 1998, if you wanted eight-passenger capability in an SUV, it meant having to step up to a full-size beast, such as a Ford Expedition or GMC Suburban. Smelling an opportunity, Dodge designed its Durango SUV to fill the gap between midsize SUVs and their larger brethren.The Durango offered a third seat that the Explorers and Blazers of the day didn't. The Durango was (and still is) based on the Dakota and shared many components, including chassis, powertrain, some body panels and many interior pieces. Power came from either a standard 5.2-liter V8 or an optional 5.9-liter V8, and all first-year Durangos had four-wheel drive. As the years went on, a two-wheel-drive version became available, a more efficient 4.7-liter V8 replaced the old 5.2, a sporty R/T model debuted, the cabin was redesigned and curtain-style side airbags became optional. Now the Durango faces a number of freshly redesigned or new challengers, such as the Ford Explorer, Chevrolet TrailBlazer EXT and Honda Pilot. All have third-row seats as well as more refined cabins. But this truck-based sport-ute doesn't try to be all things to all people and makes no apologies for its somewhat tougher character. With its class-leading towing and hauling capabilities, the Durango remains a solid choice for folks who need plenty of seating and serious hauling capacity in their midsize-ute. All Durangos can be had with either two- or part-time four-wheel-drive, except the R/T, which comes only as a full-time four-wheeler. SLT models, however, do offer the full-time system as an option. The standard power plant for all but the R/T is the contemporary 4.7-liter V8 that pumps out 235 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. Teamed with a five-speed automatic, this engine furnishes crisp throttle response with power accessible from a broad rev range. The 5.9-liter V8 (245 horsepower, 335 lb-ft) is standard on the R/T and optional on the SLTs; it comes paired with a four-speed automatic gearbox. Both engines like their gasoline; we've noticed that either one seems hard-pressed to average more than 13 mpg.The Durango is ready to work, with maximum payload and towing capacities that, at 1,770 and 7,550 pounds, respectively, outmuscle the competition. Side curtain airbags (that provide protection for the head and upper torso in side-impact collisions) are available, a feature that's rare in this class. In terms of crash tests, the Durango scored four (out of five) stars in frontal impacts and rated ""Acceptable"" (which is tantamount to three out of four stars) in frontal offset tests. There is no side-impact data available. In terms of handling dynamics, body roll is well controlled and, with the help of responsive, tight steering, the Durango can run through twisty two-lane roads with confidence, sans the tippy feeling that some other utes are plagued with. And even when carrying a full load of passengers, the suspension handles the burden with little effort, providing an excellent ride without bottoming out on bigger bumps. As far as power, the smaller V8 is fine, and along with the alert automatic gearbox, provides brisk all-around performance for this 4,500-pound SUV. Anyone familiar with the Dodge Dakota should feel right at home in the Durango, as the two share most cabin components, such as the dash and seat designs. What this means is large gauges and simple controls and, in lower trim levels, a somewhat bland decor. All but the Sport and SXT come with a third-row seat that increases passenger capacity to seven. On the SLT, a front bench seat is available, which would allow up to eight to ride in a Durango. Five versions of the Durango are offered: entry-level Sport, well-equipped SXT, luxury SLT, even plusher SLT Plus and the muscular R/T. For most folks, the SXT will be sufficient, equipped as it is with popular features such as a CD player and roof rack along with the Sport's standard fare that includes air conditioning, alloy wheels and power windows, door locks and mirrors.",,255," 295 lb-ft @ 3,200 ",, 5-speed automatic

Most notably, a rearview camera is now standard equipment. Midway through the model year, Ford discontinued the available manual transmission for the Fusion SE. With solid power, excellent fuel economy, distinctive styling and a huge array of tech features, the 2015 Ford Fusion is a great choice for a midsize sedan. Ford really upped the game for family sedans when it  unleashed its redesigned Fusion to showrooms in 2013. Stylish, sporty and  packed with features, the new Fusion was an immediate hit with car shoppers. Two  years later, Ford has revised the Fusion  with only minor fiddling of equipment, and that's OK, as the Fusion remains one  of our top choices in the highly competitive midsize sedan market.
The 2015 Fusion's appeal goes well beyond its eye-catching design.  You'd be hard-pressed to find another family car that provides a sharper  driving experience or as great a variety of configurations. The 2015 Fusion  offers three trim levels, four different engines, front- or all-wheel drive and  a broad enough array of option packages that you can craft anything from an  affordable family workhorse with a combined fuel economy of 29 mpg to an  Audi-baiting luxury sport sedan.

The 2015 Ford  Fusion comes in S, SE and Titanium trim levels. All-wheel drive is available on  the SE and Titanium.
We didn't mention Audi solely because the Fusion is one of  the few mainstream sedans available with all-wheel drive; the Fusion is also available  with an array of high-tech safety and convenience features that rival just  about any true luxury car. Everything from blind-spot warning and adaptive  cruise control to automatic parallel parking can be had on the 2015 Fusion --  and that's before you get to the ever-expanding capabilities of the current MyFord  Touch driver interface system. Although it still has quirks, the latter does offer  some very useful customization and voice control functionality.
Of course, the 2015 Fusion hasn't cornered the market for  midsize sedans that combine stylish design, clever packaging, plenty of  high-tech content and outstanding fuel efficiency. Efficiency has long been an  attribute for the Honda Accord, a  brilliantly executed sedan in almost every sense, even if its sheet metal might  not be quite as edgy as the Fusion's. Hyundai's 2015 Sonata is  redesigned, and it will no doubt still be a great car for the money. The well-rounded 2015 Nissan  Altima is another one of our family sedan favorites, and all of these cars  are top recommended in our 2015  Sedan Buying Guide. Overall, though, the 2015 Ford Fusion is right there at  the top for shoppers desiring high levels of practicality, technology and  style. The Fusion S and SE come standard with a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine that's rated at 175 horsepower and 175 pound-feet of  torque. Power is sent to the front wheels through a six-speed automatic  transmission.
For the SE, there are three engine options. There's a  turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder that produces 182  and 184 lb-ft of  torque. It comes with a six-speed manual transmission only. Note that this  engine and transmission were discontinued midway through the model year,  however. A similar-sized engine, a turbocharged 1.5-liter four-cylinder, comes  matched to a six-speed automatic. Power output is 181  and 185 lb-ft of  torque.
Those looking for maximum thrust should consider the turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder with 240  and 270 lb-ft of torque. It also comes only  with the six-speed automatic (with paddle shifters). The Fusion Titanium comes  standard with the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine.
If you want all-wheel drive -- available for either the  Fusion SE or Fusion Titanium -- you must opt for the 2.0-liter engine.
In Edmunds track testing, a 2013 Ford Fusion with the  1.6-liter and automatic transmission (a combination no longer available) went  from zero to 60 mph in 8.8 seconds, which is average for four-cylinder family  sedans. We'd expect similar performance from the 1.5-liter engine coupled with  the automatic transmission. A Fusion Titanium with the turbo 2.0-liter and all-wheel  drive accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds, about average for a  midsize sedan with all-wheel drive.

All-wheel drive  is a rare option on a midsize sedan. Equipped with AWD, the Fusion is EPA-rated  at 25 mpg combined.
EPA fuel  economy ratings for the 2015 Ford Fusion are pretty solid across the board. 
For the base 2.5-liter engine, EPA-estimated fuel economy  stands at a combined  26 mpg (22 city/34 highway), average fuel efficiency for this class. The  1.6-liter engine -- the one with the manual transmission -- amps up fuel  economy to 29  mpg combined (25 city/37 highway).
The 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder can be had with  optional automatic engine stop-start functionality to optimize fuel economy; it  improves on all of the fuel economy ratings versus the same engine without the  stop-start system. The 1.5-liter with stop-start delivers a combined  29 mpg (25/37), while the 1.5-liter without stop-start is rated at 28 mpg  combined (23/36).
Front-wheel-drive 2.0-liter-equipped Fusions earn 26 mpg  combined (22/33), while the AWD version rates 25 combined (22/31). The 2015 Ford Fusion comes standard with antilock disc  brakes, traction and stability control, front-seat side airbags, front knee  airbags and side curtain airbags. The Ford Sync  system includes an emergency crash-notification feature that automatically  dials 911 when paired with a compatible cell phone. Also standard is Ford's  MyKey, which can be used to set certain parameters for teen drivers.
Optional equipment includes  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, driver drowsiness detection  and lane-departure warning, lane-keep assist, frontal collision warning with brake  priming, and inflatable rear seatbelts. 
In Edmunds brake testing, a  Fusion Titanium stopped from 60 mph in 123 feet, an average distance for this  class of car.
The government gave the  Fusion five  out of five stars for overall crash protection, with five stars for total frontal  protection and four stars for total side-impact protection. The Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety gave the Fusion the highest possible rating of  ""Good"" in its moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and  roof strength crash tests. In the small-overlap frontal-offset test, the Fusion  earned a second-best rating of ""Acceptable."" Its head restraints and  seatbelts earned a ""Good"" rating for their whiplash protection in  rear impacts. There's a comfortable and assuring tautness to the way every  Fusion rides, and the standard electronic power steering accents the fine ride  with accurate and nimble-feeling steering that isn't too darty or  over-assisted. It all comes together to make the driver immediately feel  comfortable with its responses. Highway cruising is commendably quiet and  composed, and the well engineered seats make the Fusion a good companion for  all-day interstate hauls.
Although it's fully competitive with similarly sized engines  from Chevrolet and Honda, for instance, the Fusion's base 2.5-liter engine  isn't very inspiring. Perhaps it's because we think the ""pop"" from optional  turbocharged engines is markedly more entertaining. The 1.5-liter and 1.6-liter  turbocharged four-cylinders are smooth and eager and provide an appealing blend  of fuel efficiency and performance, even if their absolute performance isn't  eye-opening. Not so for the turbocharged 2.0-liter four, which noticeably ups  the performance aspect and works quite nicely with the optional all-wheel-drive  system. Cabin design and execution of the 2015 Ford Fusion echoes  that of its exterior. There's a cool and urbane style to the seats and dash, a  tone set largely by the high-quality finishes and, of course, the lack of  center-stack buttons afforded by the optional MyFord Touch touchscreen system.  The emphasis is on having large, nicely textured surfaces and removing  extraneous clutter, and it mostly works.

Rear-seat  headroom is a smidge tight, but otherwise the 2015 Ford Fusion has a spacious,  adult-friendly backseat.
Nonetheless, Ford interior designers got all the basics  right, with a driver seat that's easy to adjust into a just-right position and  good sight lines out the front and sides. It's harder to see through the  sloping rear window, so it's good a rearview camera now is standard.
The roof's rearward slope also cuts into rear seat headroom,  though not so much as to make most average-height rear passengers uncomfortable.  The front seats also are mounted high enough off the floor that those in the  rear can at least partially fit their feet under the front seats. Trunk space, at  16 cubic feet, is comparatively generous for the midsize sedan segment.

The MyFord Touch  interface allows you to customize various functions to your liking. But the  learning curve is steep.
Any review of a contemporary Ford must also address the  optional MyFord Touch infotainment interface. Without it, the base radio and climate controls are  still somewhat complicated to use and less aesthetically pleasing. You get a  much sleeker look with MFT, thanks to its 8-inch touchscreen. And backed by  many redundant voice commands, it can be a powerful tool for configuring and  controlling the car and your smartphone. But there can be a steep learning curve  for getting accustomed to even basic functions. And even though the system  works significantly better than when it debuted, it can still be sluggish to  operate at times. 
The Fusion S comes standard with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder  engine, 16-inch steel wheels, automatic headlights, full power accessories, an  integrated blind-spot mirror, keyless entry, a rearview camera, cruise control,  air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable  driver seat, 60/40-split-folding rear seats, the voice-activated Sync audio and  cell phone interface, and a four-speaker sound system with a CD player,  auxiliary audio jack and a USB port/iPod interface.

Leather upholstery and the MyFord Touch interface are optional in the Fusion SE and  standard in the Titanium.
Moving up to the Fusion SE gets you 17-inch alloy wheels,  exterior keypad entry, heated mirrors, an eight-way power driver seat (with  power lumbar), a six-way power passenger seat, rear air ducts, a rear center fold-down  armrest and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio.
The SE is also eligible for additional optional equipment.  The Appearance package (Equipment Group 201A) adds 18-inch alloy wheels, a rear  spoiler, foglights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and special cloth  upholstery. The Luxury package (Equipment Group 202A) adds an auto-dimming rearview  mirror and driver-side mirror, leather upholstery, driver memory settings and  heated front seats.
Opting for the SE's MyFord Touch Technology package equips  the Fusion with rear parking sensors, dual-zone automatic climate control, the  MyFord Touch electronics interface (with 8-inch central LCD touchscreen and two  configurable gauge cluster displays), an upgraded version of Sync, two USB  ports, an SD card reader and RCA video input jack.
The Fusion Titanium comes standard with the turbocharged 2.0-liter  engine, 18-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, keyless ignition and entry, remote  start, sport front seats, eight-way power adjustment for the passenger seat, a  premium 12-speaker Sony sound system, HD radio and all of the SE's optional  features mentioned above.
The Fusion SE (with the Technology package selected) and  Titanium can also be equipped with a navigation system, an automated parallel-parking  system, a heated steering wheel and adaptive cruise control with frontal collision  warning and automatic braking for frontal crash mitigation. For the SE and  Titanium, Ford additionally offers the Luxury Driver Assist package, which  includes automatic high beam control, a 110-volt power outlet, blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and lane departure warning and lane-keeping  assist. A sunroof is optional for both the SE and Titanium, and the Titanium can  be had with 19-inch wheels and ventilated front seats.",,192," 175 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",, 6-speed shiftable automatic

The 5300 V8 is now capable of running gasoline/ethanol fuel blends. With room for up to nine passengers, gutsy V8 engines and a well-sorted suspension, the Tahoe is one of the best full-size sport-utes on the market. Chevrolet calls its Tahoe a ""real"" sport-utility, implying that sport-utes are more about getting things done than doing them in style. With nearly every automaker offering an SUV these days, it takes a lot of effort to be unique. However, despite differing opinions of what does and does not constitute a good SUV, the 2002 Tahoe has a whole lot going for it.Built on the same platform as GM's full-size trucks, the Tahoe inherits the strength and durability of its workhorse brethren. The most recent redesign gave the Tahoe new sheet metal with enhanced corrosion protection and stronger dent-resistant steel. GM engineers further enhanced Tahoe's sturdiness with redesigned door hinges that last four times as long, while a unique front-end crush cap allows easy replacement in the event of a slow-speed crash.Under the hood, the 2002 Tahoe offers two powerful Vortec engines. The 4800 V8 is standard on the LS and offers 275 horsepower and 290 pound-feet of torque. Optional on the LS and standard on the LT is the 5300 V8 that ups the ante with 285 horsepower and 325 lb-ft of torque. All that power runs through an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Even with class-leading levels of power, these engines lead their competition in fuel economy and are compliant with low emission vehicle (LEV) standards. This year, Chevrolet is even offering a flexible fuel version of the 5300 V8 which allows it to burn gasoline/ethanol fuel blends that produce less harmful emissions.The powertrain benefits from previous upgrades that include the addition of a more durable rear axle, a strengthened differential case and stiffer axle shafts. But Chevy didn't bump up its off-road durability at the expense of the highway drive. With a 400 percent increase in body-mount structure stiffness over its predecessor and a five-link rear suspension, the Tahoe provides a smooth, quiet and extremely stable ride on virtually all road surfaces.Inside is an innovative 50/50 split third-row seat that provides superior cargo flexibility and the possibility to boost passenger capacity to nine. Those eight other people will be better protected because this Tahoe has a host of advanced safety features, including four-wheel ventilated disc antilock brakes, front-seat side-impact airbags, seat-mounted safety belts in the first- and third-row outboard positions, and energy-absorbing foam on the interior surfaces. The base model Tahoe LS has added additional standard options this year that make it even more comfortable and functional than before. Six-way power driver and front passenger seats are now the norm along with heated outside mirrors, foglights, side-mounted assist steps and a programmable HomeLink transmitter for opening garage doors or automatic gates. Hardcore off-road enthusiasts can order the Z71 off-road package, which gives the sturdy Tahoe an even greater assortment of protective equipment. A specially tuned suspension with larger shocks and jounce bumpers are added along with underbody skid plates to shield vital components. A locking rear differential and aggressively treaded tires aid in the traction department, while a roof rack and special Z71 appearance badges give it a distinctive look. All Z71 Tahoes also come standard with the OnStar vehicle assistance system just in case you venture a little too far from civilization. This Tahoe is one tough truck that can still handle itself well about town. With a roomy and comfortable interior, it makes for a great weekend-getaway machine. If you want a sport-utility that can handle passengers and cargo as well as it does a backcountry road, the 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe should be on your short list.",,647," 290 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 4-speed automatic 
Audi,audi a8,1997,audi a8 1997,"['Aluminum space frame and body panels, six airbags, powerful V-8 engines, sumptuous luxury appointments, light weight']",['Potential cost of repairing body damage'],4.7,"Audi revolutionizes luxury sedan construction with the Audi Space Frame, which employs seven new aircraft-grade aluminum alloys to lighten weight and provide a tighter, more crashworthy structure. The new A8 is also the first passenger car equipped with six airbags. The usual accoutrements associated with a premium German sedan are all in place. After 10 years, 40 patents, and intensive collaboration with aluminum-giant Alcoa, Audi has created the technological tour de force called A8.  Sporting senior A4 styling, sumptuous interior appointments, and the revolutionary Audi Space Frame (ASF), the A8 is lighter, tighter, and more responsive than competitors such as the BMW 7-Series, Mercedes-Benz S-Class and Cadillac Seville.The ASF employs lightweight aluminum alloy construction designed to provide superior structural rigidity, improved handling and responsiveness, better fuel efficiency, and easier recycling.  Two models are available: the A8 3.7 with front-wheel drive is powered by a 3.7-liter twin-cam aluminum-alloy V8 engine that produces 230 horsepower, and the A8 4.2 Quattro has all-wheel drive and a 300-horsepower 4.2-liter twin-cam aluminum-alloy V8 engine under the hood.  The 4.2 Quattro also comes standard with a 200-watt Audi/BOSE Music System.A8 3.7s are equipped with the same four-link front suspension design found on the A4.  This setup virtually removes torque steer while providing precise, neutral steering.  Both models have a fully independent rear suspension, which features passive rear-wheel steering to help stabilize the A8's handling at all speeds.  Standard Electronic Differential Locking (EDL) provides low-speed traction control operating through the antilock braking system on all A8s, while the A8 3.7 also benefits from Anti-slip Regulation (ASR) which controls wheel slippage at all speeds by modulating engine power.Airbags are provided for all passengers.  Dual front airbags are supplemented by side airbags tucked into the front seats.  Rear passengers also get side airbags, mounted to the seat rather than the door panel.  Other features include special glass that blocks 99 percent of UV radiation and 30 percent of total radiation energy, and a climate control system that circulates residual heat from the engine through the interior to keep things warm on very cold days.  Optional is a warm weather package that includes a power rear window sunshade and a solar sunroof that generates its own electricity to operate fresh air ventilation while the car is parked in the hot sun.Standard is an ergonomic interior slathered in burled walnut and Nappa leather upholstery.  Instrumentation is superb, and features soothing red nighttime backlighting.  Front seats are power adjustable in 14 different ways, and a memory feature accommodates four different settings for the driver's seat, exterior mirrors, driver's headrest height, and steering wheel position.  The steering wheel tilts out of the way when the key is removed from the ignition.  The automatic dual-zone temperature controls employ two sunlight sensors to help maintain accuracy.  A central locking system controls windows, door locks, sunroof, trunk, and fuel door.  All windows have one-touch up/down function, enhanced by a pinch protection system.Audi claims that the A8 4.2 Quattro will get from rest to 60 mph a hair under seven seconds.  Retail price is exactly $65,000 at this writing.  In comparison, the 740iL runs a smidge more while the Mercedes-Benz S320 short-wheelbase model runs a tad less.  The A8 3.7, at more than $57,000, is more expensive than the Cadillac STS, the Infiniti Q45 and the Lexus LS400.  Audi is on a roll lately, thanks to the excellent A4 sedan, which manages to undercut nearly all of its competition in the entry-level luxury class without sacrificing the luxury portion of the equation.  Time will tell if the rather expensive A8's technological advances are desirable enough to bring BMW, Lexus and Benz intenders into Audi showrooms.",,139," 295 lb-ft @ 3,300 ",, 5-speed automatic

One major flaw, namely twitchy steering, turns us off the Expedition. Twitchy steering is not something you want in a tall 5,000-pound vehicle.  Which one do you think Goldilocks would pick? With the new Excursion on the breakfast table for 2000, it seems Ford has enough different-sized SUVs to satisfy everyone. And for those people who want something bigger than an Explorer, but smaller than an Excursion, the Expedition should be just right.After allowing GM to dominate the full-size SUV arena for years, in 1997 Ford introduced the Expedition, which had its sights squarely aimed at the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon.  Able to seat nine people with its optional third-row bench seat, Expedition should also be easier to park and maneuver than a Suburban (or Excursion, for that matter). The vehicle has a solid payload and towing capacity: 2,000 lbs. and 8,000 lbs., respectively.The reverse-sensing sonar system and power-adjustable pedals (both which can also be found on a variety of other Ford products this year) are the two main upgrades for 2000. The sonar system detects certain objects in the vehicle's path while backing up slowly. The system alerts drivers to objects behind the vehicle within 5.9 feet. Warning beeps are audible within the cabin and, as the vehicle approaches the object, the beeps sound more frequently, becoming a continuous tone when the object is within 10 inches of the vehicle. The power-adjustable pedals allow drivers of smaller stature to move the pedals toward their feet rather than moving the seat uncomfortably close to the steering wheel.On the road the Expedition is well mannered. It's obviously not a car, but compared to the old Ford Bronco, the Expedition rides like a limousine. A revised center console, memory seats and an electrochromic rearview mirror are new for this year. Expedition buyers can now order the vehicle with two single third-row seats instead of the standard 60/40-split bench seat. Like the second-row bench seating, the two individual seats can be stowed if extra cargo-carrying capacity is required.Ford has put a lot of time and money into making this truck a sales leader in their already dominant light-truck lineup. The Expedition comes standard with dual airbags, antilock brakes and optional side airbags. Our biggest gripe stems from the powertrain. While Ford has boosted output for both the 4.6- and 5.4-liter engines, they still can seem less powerful when compared to the Vortec power plants found in GM's full-size trucks. One option that we think everyone should investigate is the lighted running boards. The Expedition towers above the ground, and entering and exiting this truck will take its toll on most passengers after a few daysThe Ford Expedition is a nice balance between comfort and function, and its ability to seat nine people makes it popular with large families and those who have to haul stuff around.  Nevertheless, we can't overlook the Dodge Durango and the outstanding Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon when discussing big trucks. In the last few years, the mid- and full-size sport-ute market has gotten very competitive and the choices are much more difficult to make.",,276," 290 lb-ft @ 3,250 ",, 4-speed automatic

It's  available in many configurations, with three roof heights, two wheelbase  lengths, and rear- and all-wheel drive to choose from. Additionally, the  Transit Cargo offers two gasoline engine options and even an all-electric  variant called the E-Transit (reviewed separately).  
For  2023, Ford introduces a new optional in-mirror camera system that allows  drivers to see behind them even if their cargo van has no rear windows. The  base 3.5-liter V6 also gets an engine stop-start system as standard. Other than  that, the Transit soldiers on with some minor reshuffling of packages and  options.
Because  the Transit has so many customization options, it can be tailored for whatever  your business needs. For a van, the Transit's interior is surprisingly  pleasant. The dashboard is familiar and car-like, and the standard infotainment  system is easy to use. When you upgrade to the optional Sync 4 system, the  cabin is transformed by a tablet-sized screen front and center in the dash.

Some cars make you feel like a champion. This one makes you feel like a hero. Honda starts the new millennium by bringing the buying public the first production gasoline-electric hybrid.  With its ultralow drag styling, aluminum body structure and innovative Integrated Motor Assist (IMA), the Insight can travel as far as 70 miles on a gallon of gas (with a 10.6-gallon fuel tank, you can drive from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City and still have a gallon of gas in reserve).The heart of the system is a new 1.0-liter, three-cylinder engine coupled with an ultrathin electric motor that assists the gasoline engine under acceleration.  The package features an idle-stop feature, which shuts off the engine when the driver places the shift lever in neutral and releases the clutch pedal. Unlike GM's all-electric EV-1, the Insight requires no external power supply to recharge the 144-volt nickel-metal hydride batteries.  Electricity for the system is generated primarily by regenerative braking and ABS-assisted disc/drum brakes bring the Insight to a halt.  With a full charge, and the electric motor providing full assist, the Insight accelerates swiftly, seemingly faster than a Toyota Echo.Available only with a five-speed manual (designed with special gears to reduce rotational mass), the transmission has relatively short first, second and third gears for good city driving performance, with tall overdrive gearing in fourth and fifth to maximize fuel economy.Like the Acura NSX, the Insight's unitized body is made of aluminum (except for the front fenders, which are made from plastic) and boasts a drag coefficient of only 0.25.  Thanks to its aerodynamic bodywork, flat underbody, low rolling resistance tires and extensive use of lightweight materials, the Insight requires 30 percent less power to operate at highway speeds than the Honda Civic.But the effort to save weight drag pays a price in the handling department.  The Insight is highly susceptible to crosswinds and the narrow tires easily track any groove in the pavement, causing the driver to adjust the steering continually to compensate.The Insight's interior is just as futuristic with a sweeping dash, aluminum trim surround and high-tech LCD analog/digital instrument display.  Divided into three sections, the cluster displays engine rpm, coolant temperature and the engine's idiot lights on the left bank; a large digital speedometer, odometer, lifetime fuel economy bar graph and instant fuel economy in the middle; and fuel level, battery level indicator and the IMA charge and assist indicator on the right bank.Dual high-back bucket seats feature good lateral and lumbar support and controls for power windows, mirrors, AM/FM cassette stereo, ventilation and available automatic HVAC controls are all within easy reach, but two large adults will find themselves knocking elbows in the tight cockpit.  Built fully equipped (the only option is an automatic air conditioning system) with power windows, door locks, exterior mirrors, an AM/FM cassette stereo, dual airbags, rear window defroster and a whole lot more, the Insight is an incredible value for a hybrid vehicle.Despite the handling shortcomings and quick-to-drain batteries, Honda has finally brought forth a realistic option to gasoline engine-only cars with an ultralow-emission vehicle that can be driven anywhere without the worry of having to find an electrical outlet.  And while the competition scrambles to bring their hybrids to market, we bet Honda will sell every Insight they can produce.",,150," 91 lb-ft @ 2,000 ",, 5-speed manual

The Corolla is a fine car with good handling characteristics, a well-designed interior, and attractive, if not earth-shattering, looks.  Additionally, the optional antilock brakes, better than average crash test scores and integrated child seat on DX models go a long way toward making the Corolla a reasonably affordable, safe, compact family-sedan.The wagon variant disappears for 1997, and Toyota introduces a new CE trim level that stands for Classic Edition.

A small technicality, we suppose, but there are no technicalities when it comes to the Camaro's performance abilities, particularly in Z28 or SS guise.  These Camaros are blazingly quick, hold the road tenaciously, cost less than the average price of a new car in this country and get decent gas mileage when they're not being hammered along a twisty, two-lane road.Two trim levels are available for 1999, in either coupe or convertible body styles.  Base Camaros are powered by a 3800 Series II V6 that makes 200 horsepower.  That's 45 more ponies than Ford's 1998 Mustang V6 produces.  Phased in during the 1995 model year, the 3800 V6 can be mated to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission.  With a manual, this powerplant gets the Camaro to 60 mph nearly as quickly as a Ford Mustang GT.  In fact, the existence of this motor makes a strong argument for avoiding the higher insurance rates and prices of the Z28.  An optional Performance Handling Package puts dual exhaust, tighter steering and a limited-slip differential on the V6 Camaro.The Z28 is the go-faster Camaro.  Equipped with a detuned Corvette 5.7-liter V8, the Z28 makes 305 horsepower, 80 more horses than the 1998 Mustang GT.  Opt for the SS Performance Package and you get 320 horsepower, thanks to forced air induction through an aggressive-looking hood scoop.  The SS gets to 60 mph from rest in a little over five seconds.  SLP Engineering, known for working magic with GM's F-bodies since the late 80s, does the conversion work for the Z28 SS.  See your dealer for details.  For 1999, revisions are few.

The Camaro holds a respectable amount of gear in the cargo hold (more than 33 cubic feet of space with the generally useless rear seats folded down), and airbags and antilock brakes are standard.Rumors are flying that GM is set to kill the Camaro after the 2001 model run.  Steadily declining sales are to blame, and the company is eager to slice non-performing models from the lineup.  If the Camaro dies, it would be a real shame because, from a bang-for-the-buck standpoint, the Z28 is unbeatable. ",V6 cylinder ,157," 225 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual

Largely comprised of car-based AWD vehicles, the territory of this market has been staked out by Chevrolet, Honda, Kia, Nissan, Subaru, and Suzuki. Toyota, too, recognized this potential boom early on and jumped into the action with the introduction of the '96 RAV4. A 2.0-liter, 127-horsepower engine hooked to either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission powers the front or all four wheels of the different RAV4 models. All-wheel-drive versions use powertrain components from the long-defunct Celica All-Trac. Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional on all RAV4s. Minimum ground clearance measures 7.5 inches.The RAV4 is an adequate around-town driver, handling more like the car from which its platform is derived than a traditional SUV. Power is on the low side, however. It offers some initial pep when pulling away from stoplights, but any serious attempt at acceleration results in nothing more than noise and vibration. The engine gets particularly obnoxious above 4,500 where underhood clatter is enough to stifle conversation between passengers.

Infiniti only recently added Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  smartphone connections, and the base trim Q60 lacks basic collision avoidance  features common on most cars today.It's  an easy case to make that the Audi S5, BMW 4 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class  are better overall. But the Q60's sharp style and just-enough luxury for the  price can make it a decent pick for a luxury coupe in 2021. Simply  seeking a sport coupe with style? You'll be best served by the Q60 Luxe. It provides a solid combination  of luxury and price, and it can be tailored to taste with many of the top  options. And if considering the Red Sport 400, avoid the ProActive package. It  comes with a different steering system that lacks road feel and zaps much of  the car's fun.",V6 cylinder ,200," 295 lb-ft @ 1,600 ",, 7-speed shiftable automatic 
Ford,ford gt,2017,ford gt 2017,"['Max-attack handling capabilities', 'Race-bred aerodynamics give it a distinct look', 'High price and limited production ensure exclusivity']","[""Turbocharged V6 isn't brimming with personality"", 'High price and limited production make it hard to get']",,"If  nothing else, you have to give credit to Ford for the audacity to build the new  GT. When the company thinks ""sports car,"" it only thinks big. As in,  JFK-moon-shot big. There's no bothering with an ""everyman"" sports car  like a Mazda Miata or a Porsche 911. Nope, Ford starts you off with the  comparably plebeian Mustang sport coupe and then goes full afterburner to  planet Gonzo to deliver the 2017 Ford GT, a carbon-fiber missile with enough  wings and vents to shame the Batmobile and racing cred straight from Le Mans.  You could pilot a Princess cruise ship between the product lineup gap here.  A  follow-up to the 2005-2006 GT, which was itself a reboot of the original  1960s-era Ford GT40 race car, the 2017 has plenty of heritage to back it up.  But while the previous-generation GT could be viewed as unapologetically  American — it was built on a relatively shoestring budget, packed a  beefy supercharged V8, and lacked any sort of stability control safety nets to  save your bacon — the new car goes high-tech in a way that only the  proudest exotic automakers from Europe could pull off. What  makes it unique? Just about everything. The underlying structure is largely  made of carbon fiber, the super-strong and super-light material used in elite  race cars and typically the world's elite road-going sports cars. Ford uses  aluminum for the front and rear suspension subframes and then whips out more  carbon fiber for the body panels. The car's final curb weight is around 3,300  pounds.Although  carbon-fiber construction is commonplace these days for an exotic, the GT's  aerodynamics certainly aren't. When viewed from overhead, the body has a  raindrop shape to it that tapers at the rear of the car inside the rear wheels.  Buttresses then connect the rear wheel fenders to the central section of the  car, with the end result being enhanced aerodynamics for greater stability and  downforce. There's also the car's suite of active aero enhancements, which  include an amply sized rear wing that rises at high speed to provide more  downforce and a sophisticated adjustable suspension that can quickly lower the  ride height approximately 2 inches to maximize grip and stability. The  car's aerodynamics partially come about from what's mounted amidships: a  turbocharged EcoBoost 3.5-liter V6 engine. Erm, wait, what? Like, a Ford F-150  EcoBoost V6? Yes, you read that right. It's highly unusual to have just six  cylinders in an exotic like this, but Ford says the GT V6's smaller size  (compared to, say, a V8 or V10/V12) allows for the tapering of the rear  bodywork. Put the pedal to the floor, and it'll huff and puff out a stout 647  horsepower and 550 pound-feet of torque. Keep the gas pedal pinned while  driving in a straight line and Ford says you'll eventually top out at 216 mph. Ford  is selling just a handful of GTs for the 2017 model year at prices approaching  half a million dollars. That might seem a bit cavalier for the Blue Oval,  seeing as how exotics such as the Ferrari 488 GTB, Lamborghini Aventador and  McLaren 675LT are all less expensive. But the GT counters with its unique  aerodynamic and suspension designs, and those should give the GT a distinct  edge at a racetrack. Of  course, buying a road-going exotic is less about dollars and cents and more  about emotion and lust. And for those qualities, the new 2017 Ford GT easily  wins, too, all while proudly displaying the red, white and blue. Ford offers only one trim level for the GT and a small selection of options. There's little advice we can provide other than ""get what your heart desires."" Standard  feature highlights include Brembo carbon ceramic brakes, 20-inch alloy wheels,  Michelin Pilot Sport Cup tires, an adaptive suspension with an adjustable ride  height, and adjustable drive modes. Inside you'll find fixed carbon-fiber  Sparco seats and a central touchscreen display with Ford's Sync 3 interface. Most  of the options for the GT relate to cosmetic alterations such as stripes, brake  caliper color and interior trim colors. Twenty-inch carbon fiber wheels are  another option. The '66 Heritage Edition has a black-and-gold color scheme  meant to evoke the look of the 1966 Ford GT40 that won Le Mans that year.

It comes with a bigger battery pack that  you can plug into a charging station or wall outlet to recharge. Doing so  provides an EPA-estimated 29 miles of electric range. After that the Ioniq  Plug-In Hybrid switches over to being a regular gasoline hybrid and gets an  impressive 52 mpg in combined city/highway driving. The  more frequently you can recharge the less dependent on gas you'll be. In that  sense, the Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid provides a nice stepping stone between the  gas-only Ioniq Hybrid and the electric-only Ioniq Electric.The  Hyundai Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid is a small hatchback that is primarily concerned  with delivering high fuel economy. Like its primary competitor, the Toyota  Prius Prime plug-in, the Ioniq isn't very exciting to drive. It is, however,  adequately comfortable, and it offers more cargo space than other plug-ins. We  also think the Ioniq makes a strong value statement because of its compelling  price and more standard and optional features than its direct rivals.Edmunds'  Expert Rating for the Ioniq Plug-In HybridDue to significant updates for 2020, we're  revising our rating for the Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid. In the meantime, check out  our full rating of last  year's Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid for a comprehensive evaluation.

A powerful 194-horsepower V6 engine rests under the hood of all models. Safety equipment includes standard antilock brakes, low tire-pressure warning systems and five-mph front and rear bumpers. Sienna boasts outstanding crash test scores. Just when you thought it was safe to call the minivan market dead, Toyota does the unthinkable and makes this typically boring corner of automobilia interesting.  Toyota's new minivan sits in sharp contrast to the one it replaces.  Whereas the Previa was a study in minivan abnormalities, with rear-wheel drive, a midship-mounted supercharged engine and a shape that looked like the droid escape pod from the first Star Wars movie, the Sienna is a model of suburban respectability.That doesn't, however, mean that this minivan is boring.  Resting under the hood is a powerful 3.0-liter V6 engine that was stolen from the Camry parts bin.  The engine isn't the only piece of equipment  pilfered from the Camry; the Sienna rides on a stretched and modified Camry platform and uses much of the Camry's interior switchgear.  Appropriately referred to internally at Toyota as ""The Camry of minivans,"" we can only assume that the company expects this creation to be as popular as their recently redesigned sedan.In order to harness the 194 horses at work under the hood, engineers put antilock brakes at all four wheels of every Sienna.  Other safety equipment includes dual airbags, side-impact protection that meets future federal standards and seatbelt pretensioners for both front seats.  Toyota is so confident in this vehicle's crashworthiness that they proclaim in their press kit that it will deliver ""best-in-class"" in tests administered by third parties.  The claim has been substantiated.  The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conducted an offset crash test of the Sienna and called it ""the best performing vehicle in the history of the test.""Interestingly, Toyota was able to talk rivals General Motors and Chrysler into lending a hand on the Sienna's manufacturing process.  Not used to making such a large vehicle, Toyota had questions about how to deal with the interior assembly of this van that has well over 130 cubic feet of cargo space.In the end, General Motors and Chrysler may be sorry that they offered to help Toyota figure out some of their manufacturing logistics.  Toyota is expecting to sell 70,000 of these minvans annually.  If  they increase capacity, they could become a real thorn in the side of the Big Three that has heretofore dominated the minivan industry.

At some point, GMC freshened the Savana's face  and gave it a restyled dashboard and steering wheel. Naturally, the company  also improved it to keep up with new regulations, so the Savana has  cutting-edge standard technology like a backup camera. And let's not forget  about the marvel that is Bluetooth.  
But  at 27 years of age and counting, the GMC Savana is positively ancient in  automotive years. Still, the Savana and its twin, the Chevrolet Express, are  not without merit. They're the last truck-based full-size vans available, and  they can tow more weight than any of their remaining rivals. They can carry a  substantial payload too. Plus, they're less expensive than the Ford Transit,  Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and Ram ProMaster.
Full-size  vans have taken a big step forward since the Savana was designed and  engineered. For example, the Ford, Mercedes and Ram all offer high-roof options  that allow their vans to pack in more cargo or make it easier to load and  unload people. Plus, the Savana's newer rivals offer a wider array of  configuration, more options, and modern infotainment and safety technology. You  can even get all-wheel drive on the Ford and Mercedes.
While  there is some appeal in the Savana's tried-and-true design and its low starting  price, we suggest checking out the other vans in this segment. If  you're getting a Savana Cargo Van, it comes only in the Work Van trim level, so  you have no choice in the matter. When it comes to the Savana Passenger Van,  however, we suggest that you skip the LS in favor of the LT.

XL trim level trucks now have optional bucket seats. Clean fuel (LEV) gasoline engines are standard on all Super Duty trucks. Power windows and locks are now standard on XLT trim levels. The trailer/tow mirrors now telescope manually. Rear bumpers are standard on all F-250 and F-350 pickups. All Super Duty trucks get new interior and exterior colors. Commercial/small business demand is one of the fastest growing segments in the expanding truck market. With its F-Super Duty trucks, Ford is aiming squarely at fulfilling this segment.The Super Duty trucks are built on a separate platform than the smaller F-150. The line of trucks comes in 44 different configurations, many of which are unique to the truck market. Ford Super Duty trucks are powered by a Triton 5.4-liter V8 or a 6.8-liter V10. The V8 generates 260 horsepower at 4,500 and 350 pound-feet of torque at 2,500 rpm. The V10 generates 275 horsepower at 4,250 and 410 lb-ft of torque at 2,650 rpm. A 7.3-liter diesel V8 is also available, and it makes 235 horsepower at 2,700 and 500 lb-ft of torque at 1,600 rpm.Ford F-Super Duty models are available in Regular Cab, four-door SuperCab, and Crew Cab. The overall look is much more aggressive than the standard F-150, and its bigger dimensions allow Ford to used larger cabs without compromising load space. Given their size, the F-250 and F-350 Super Duty trucks maintain a confident on- and off-road feel. They feature updated power steering systems and enhanced suspension components to improve vehicle ride, handling, responsiveness and maneuverability.  Just don't mistake them for a car. Unlike the F-150, Dodge Ram and Chevy Silverado (all of which have become much more comfortable and user-friendly these past few years), the Super Duty vehicles are true trucks. They ride harshly when unloaded and 4x4 trucks come only with manually locking hubs. These manual hubs (along with the solid front and rear axles) do give the Super Duty trucks improved off-road capabilities, however.Inside, the roomy cabs have larger, more comfortable seats and greater seat-track travel. In addition, there are many interior convenience features designed for today's stylish business owners. For example, a fold-down armrest and utility bin is designed to house a portable fax machine or laptop computer. In the Crew Cab XLT and Lariat models, a new rear bench seat incorporates a fold-down armrest and a cupholder. For truck owners who don't want to skimp on luxury, leather seating, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, air conditioning and power windows are just some of the many options available.

The redesigned Accent and new Sonata are proving that this South Korean automaker has finally learned how to build a good car. The current Elantra provides even more proof, and the company offers an industry-leading warranty program to back it up. Though not as refined as some competitors, the 140- Elantra holds its own in the economy car segment. Besides offering a generous warranty, it's cheaper than comparably equipped Civics and Corollas. Called the Hyundai Advantage, the new buyer-assurance program is a great incentive to buy a Hyundai over one of the many other compact choices on the market. With the purchase of any Hyundai vehicle, consumers will receive an awesome 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. If the car is sold within those first 10 years, the new owner will still be entitled to a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. Also part of the program is 5-year/100,000-mile corrosion coverage and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty for 5 years or 60,000 miles. Additionally, the program offers free 24-hour roadside assistance for five years, which includes towing and lockout service. New under the hood of the Elantra is the 140-horsepower, 2.0-liter DOHC engine that powers the Tiburon. Riding on a four-wheel independent suspension, the Elantra features smooth, stable handling. A speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system communicates improved road feel to the driver. Designers fiddled around with the Elantra's exterior in 1999, restyling the front end with a bold new grille, sleek hood lines and a larger air-intake opening. Headlights feature a multifocus reflector system and the Elantra gets revised turn-signal lamps. Inside the Elantra, consumers will find rotary-type climate controls and a steering wheel that uses a low-weight magnesium core for greater strength and durability. To enhance ride comfort, front seatbacks have been slightly widened. Dual airbags are standard on the Elantra, housed in a two-piece dashboard designed to reduce squeaks and rattles. Adjustable headrests and seatbelt anchors are standard, and all models come with driver side lumbar support and seat-height adjustments. Extensive use of sound-deadening materials helps quiet this compact car. The five-speed sedan includes air conditioning, 5-mph bumpers, rear window defroster, dual remote control mirrors, rear-seat heating ducts, intermittent windshield wipers, remote fuel and trunk releases, cassette stereo, tilt steering column, and speed-sensitive steering. Option packages can add automatic transmissions, power door locks, power outside mirrors, six-way adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split folding rear seat, power windows, rear spoilers and antilock brakes.

Second-generation airbags debut. Chevrolet is producing good cars and trucks.  Witness the excellent values to be found in the Blazer, Camaro, Cavalier and Lumina.  The Malibu is more of a good thing.  In fact, this is probably the best family car produced by any domestic automaker today.Consumer clinics determined much of the Malibu's design.  Engineers used a nearly identical methodology when concocting the recipe for the successful Lumina.  What consumers have demanded is a tight, solid, roomy fun-to-drive midsized sedan.  Guess what?  Chevrolet delivers, and delivers big.  The Malibu is all of these things and more, wrapped in unobtrusive but attractive sheetmetal and sold at a price that undercuts similarly equipped imports and domestics.Two models are available.  The base Malibu features a 2.4-liter twin-cam four-cylinder engine, which is the same one found under the hood of the Cavalier Z24.  Gears are shifted automatically, and standard equipment includes four-wheel antilock brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, battery rundown protection, theft deterrent system, tachometer, air conditioning, rear seat heat ducts, tilt steering wheel and remote trunk release.  Step up to LS trim, and you leave the showroom in a fully loaded car.  The LS includes a 3.1-liter V6 engine, aluminum wheels, fog lights, remote keyless entry, power driver's seat, power windows and door locks, cruise control, uplevel stereo and a trunk cargo net.This Chevy goes, slows and turns corners well enough to be entertaining.  Interior design elements include a handy left-handed cupholder, backlighting for major controls and switches throughout the interior and heating and air conditioning ducts located on the A-pillar to help direct air flow to rear seat passengers.  Also notable is the dash-mounted ignition switch.  Moving the switch from the steering column to the dashboard means the driver doesn't have to crane his neck around to find the ignition slot.Safety concerns are covered by the Malibu.  Dual airbags, four-wheel antilock brakes and child safe rear door locks are standard.  According to Chevrolet, side-impact door beams exceed federal standards for protection, though federal side-impact crash tests indicate that occupants may actually be rather vulnerable in this car.  Maintaining the Malibu has been made easy with platinum-tipped spark plugs that last 100,000 miles, engine coolant designed to last five years or 150,000 miles and transmission fluid that never has to be changed or checked.Our list of gripes is short.  The fake wood in the LS is unnecessary.  We also want to find an integrated child safety seat on the options list in the future.  And why can buyers get traction control on  the Cavalier but not the Malibu?  The list of improvements for 1998 is a short one, and doesn't address our gripes.  A sunroof is newly optional, and LS models can be equipped with leather seating.  Aluminum wheels get an enhanced appearance this year.We're impressed by the new Malibu.  Evidently, both Motor Trend and AAA are as well.  Motor Trend named the Malibu Car of the Year for 1997, and last year AAA lcalled the Malibu the best car to buy in the $15,000 to $20,000 range.

Trim levels range from the practical XL through the well-trimmed XLT and STX--all the way to the beguiling little Ranger Splash with its fiberglass Flareside bed, chrome wheels, and lowered suspension.With the optional 4.0-liter V6 engine, in particular, acceleration is impressively brisk, whether from a standstill or when merging and passing.  The base four cylinder engine can overtax the Ranger when carrying a heavy load.  Automatic-transmission upshifts are crisp and barely noticed, with just a slight jolt under hard throttle, and downshifts deliver only slightly more harshness.  Push-button four-wheel-drive, if installed, is a snap to use.Well-controlled overall, with good steering feedback, Rangers handle easily, corner capably (within limits), maneuver neatly, and stay reasonably stable on curves.  Occupants aren't likely to complain about the ride, either, though it can grow bouncy around town.  Gas mileage isn't the greatest with the big engine and automatic, as expected.Ranger sports an worldwide industry first for safety protection this year.  An optional passenger side airbag is available, and it can be disabled with the flick of a switch in the event that a car seat is installed in the truck.  Also new for 1996 is a 100,000-mile tune-up interval on the 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine, and standard privacy glass on Supercab models.

Trim changes include the deletion of the garish green tape stripe on Splash models, as well as the cargo cover on Supercab models.  The XL Sport disappears from the lineup.Seats are firm and supportive, urging you to lean back and enjoy a long haul.

You can also choose between two gasoline V8 engines  and a turbodiesel V8 and add four-wheel drive and a dual-rear-wheel axle if  that's what you need. Spec the truck to your requirements and the F-350 will be  ready for just about any task or adventure you're planning. 
People often buy the F-350 for its towing  and hauling capabilities. When properly equipped, this heavy-duty full-size  pickup supplies a maximum conventional towing capacity of 21,200 pounds. If you  set the F-350 up for fifth-wheel towing, it can handle a trailer weighing up to  35,750 pounds. Either way, these ratings make the F-350 compatible with most  big recreational and commercial-oriented trailers. If hauling is what you need,  the F-350 can carry a maximum payload of 7,850 pounds in its cargo bed,  depending on the configuration.
To make the F-350 appealing to the  largest number of customers possible, Ford makes it available in a range of  models spanning from a basic work truck to a plush and technologically advanced  luxury model. If you spend lots of time off-road, consider the F-350's Tremor  package for its added capability when the going gets tough. Ford even offers an  integrated winch for the Tremor that supplies 12,000 pounds of capacity.
This year, Ford makes a few changes to  further improve the F-350's appeal. The King Ranch and Platinum trims join the  Limited in offering standard four-wheel drive and 20-inch wheels, and all but  the two most affordable versions of the truck get a new 12-inch touchscreen  display that's an upgrade over the base 4.2- or 8-inch screen.

With the Avalon, Toyota takes on a traditionally Detroit-dominated section of the marketplace: the full-size sedan.  The last assault Toyota made on a domestic market was in 1993, when the T100 pickup was introduced as an alternative to big trucks from Ford, GM and Dodge.  The 1994 Dodge Ram and the lack of a V8 in the Toyota conspired to keep sales to a minimum.  We think the company has learned something from its experience with the T100.For instance, the Avalon's V6 is a powerful motor, allowing the Avalon to keep up with GM front-drivers like the LeSabre and Bonneville in acceleration, and besting the V8-powered Crown Victoria in  the race to 60 mph. Handling is on par with the Bonneville SSE, and braking is outstanding.The news for 1998 is the Avalon's mild restyle.  New this year are safety features like seat-mounted side-impact airbags, pretensioner seatbelts with force limiters and exterior revisions like a new grille, trunk lid, headlamps, taillights and bodyside moldings.Inside, the Avalon is noticeably narrower than the domestic competition, but six will fit in a pinch when equipped with the optional bench seat.  The rear seat is exceptionally comfortable, offering more leg and foot room than bigger sedans, with good support and a high seating position.Front seats are comfy as well, and face an ergonomically designed dashboard that places everything right where you expect to find it.

An in-dash CD player finally makes it onto the standard features list. The center stack has been altered to accommodate the new automatic climate controls. Steptronic automanual operation has been altered so that you move the transmission lever forward for downshifts and backward for upshifts. Bi-xenon headlamps are on the options list so that both low and high beams can glow a cold blue and can be set to automatic operation. Rear side airbags are available for coupes and convertibles. Two new colors, Electric Red and Gray Green (and a Natural Brown interior leather) join the color spectrum. If you've got the bucks, this is unequivocally the best car in the entry-luxury category. The fifth-generation 3 Series was introduced in sedan form in 1999, followed by the coupes, the convertible and the wagon. We like 'em all. This year, few changes are in store for this homerun hit, among them some exterior alterations and increased feature content. Mostly, we're just pleased that BMW has abandoned its misguided attempt to appease the masses by lightening up the steering. It has now been restored to its former glory.  Sedan buyers can choose from a 2.5-liter inline six (models with this powerplant use the numerical designation of 325) that makes 184 horsepower, or a 3.0-liter inline six (330 models). The latter engine bumps horsepower and torque to 225 and 214, respectively, in the 3.0-liter engine and adds some noticeable punch to the 3 Series, keeping it ahead of rivals like the Audi A4 and Lexus IS 300.All 3 Series sedans, coupes and convertibles receive a standard five-speed manual transmission, a sport-tuned suspension and ventilated front and rear disc brakes. Two versions of the coupe are available: the 325Ci, with the aforementioned 2.5-liter inline six, and the 330Ci with the more powerful 3.0-liter engine, larger brakes and standard 17-inch wheels. The more powerful 330 coupe reaches 60 from 0 in just 6.4 seconds and features a broad torque band. Both engines meet low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards. A five-speed Steptronic automanual transmission is available for those who don't want to shift their own gears.Another option is all-wheel drive. Derived from the all-wheel-drive system found in the X5, ""xi"" models split 38 percent of the engine's power to the front wheels and 62 percent to the rear. The AWD package also includes a 0.7-inch increase in ride height and is available on both 325 and 330 sedans, as well as the 325 wagon.If you opt for the 325Ci convertible, you'll have to lower the top manually unless you pop the extra cash for the power top, but 330Ci ragtop consumers get this perk standard. To BMW's credit, convertibles come with a glass rear window and rollover protection. Wagon buyers will appreciate the touring model's standard roof rack and rear window wiper, but, as with the sedan, don't expect to carry full-sized adults in the backseat for long periods of time.Safety equipment on all 3 Series models includes All-Season Traction (AST) and Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), along with dual front airbags, door-mounted side airbags and BMW's patented Head Protection System (S). Dynamic Brake Control reinforces the driver's effort during emergency braking. Rear side airbags and xenon headlights remain optional.The 3 Series remains at the top of its game in terms of driving dynamics, looks and quality.

If poor visibility, questionable build quality, and a cheapo interior don't bother you, the Camaro is as fast as it gets for under $30K. ""From the country that invented rock 'n' roll"" claimed the advertisements for this Quebec, Canada-built sport coupe when it was redesigned in 1993. A small technicality, we suppose, but there are no technicalities when it comes to the Camaro's performance abilities, particularly in Z28 or SS guise. These Camaros are blazingly quick, hold the road tenaciously, cost less than the average price of a new car in this country and get decent gas mileage when they're not being hammered along a twisty, two-lane road. Two trim levels are available for 2001 in either coupe or convertible bodystyles. Base Camaros are powered by a 3800 Series II V6 that makes 200 horsepower. Mated to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission, this sufficiently stout motor makes a strong argument for avoiding the higher insurance rates and prices of the Z28. An optional performance-handling package puts dual exhaust, tighter steering and a limited-slip differential on the V6 Camaro. The Z28 is the go-faster Camaro. Equipped with a detuned Corvette 5.7-liter V8, the Z28 makes 310 horsepower, 50 more horses than the Mustang GT. Opt for the SS performance package and you get 320 real horsepower (same as the 1999 Mustang Cobra), thanks to forced air induction through an aggressive-looking hood scoop. The SS gets to 60 mph from rest in a little over five seconds. SLP Engineering - known for working magic with GM's F-Bodies since the late '80s - supplies the parts to turn a Z28 into an SS. For 2001, revisions are few. Revalved shocks, newly restyled 16"" chrome wheels, an additional five horsepower for the LS1-powered Z28 and one new exterior color are available. The interior of the Camaro is functional, but cheap in appearance. Visibility is nothing to brag about either. The Camaro holds a respectable amount of gear in the cargo hold (more than 33 cubic feet of space with the generally useless rear seats folded down), and airbags and antilock brakes are standard. Rumors are still flying that GM is set to kill the Camaro, and since no product is scheduled for the Canadian Camaro plant after 2002, those rumors are likely true. Steadily declining sales are to blame, and the company is eager to slice non-performing models from the lineup. If the Camaro dies, it would be a real shame because - from a bang-for-the-buck standpoint - the Z28 is unbeatable. More mature drivers can order traction control, but that option defeats some of the fun of Chevy's pony car: smoky, adolescent burnouts that leave the drivers behind choking on charred Goodyears.",V6 cylinder ,210," 225 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual

If you order an automatic transmission, a gauge that measures transmission oil temperature replaces the battery gauge, and you can opt to add adjustable pedals to your Super Duty XLT or Lariat truck. Trucks with the Power Stroke diesel get an air filter service indicator. All F-250s get roof ride handles standard for 2002, and the available telescoping trailer mirrors can now be folded forward. SuperCabs have new rear door panel map pockets with molded-in cupholders. XL gets upgraded visors, while XLT and Lariat get new seats with increased width, bolstering and lumbar support; jewellike headlamp lenses and an available Advanced Security Group that includes remote keyless entry, automatic door locks and automatic headlamps. Optional on the XLT Crew Cab and standard on the Lariat Crew Cab is a power front passenger seat. The Lariat also gets a larger standard overhead console with improved storage. When it comes to heavy-duty pick 'em ups, you can choose between a Chevy, a Dodge, a Ford or a GMC. Match your needs to the truck with the most capability to meet them, and you're all set. Of course, which model you select is also guided by brand loyalty. If you're a Ford kind of guy or gal with big loads to haul or tow, the F-250 Super Duty pickup will handle up to 8,800-pounds GVWR or a 14,500-pound fifth-wheel trailer. Commercial use is one of the fastest-growing segments in the expanding truck market. With its F-Series Super Duty trucks, Ford is aiming squarely at fulfilling this segment's demand.The Super Duty trucks are built on a separate platform from the smaller F-150. Bigger, stronger and more robust, they are meant to perform feats of which the F-150 isn't capable. The maximum GVWR for the F-150 is 7,700 pounds, whereas the F-250 Super Duty manages 8,800 pounds. The main mission here is towing and hauling. To provide the necessary grunt, Ford offers three different engines. The gasoline engines are a Triton 5.4-liter V8 and a 6.8-liter V10. The V8 generates 255 horsepower at 4,500 and 350 pound-feet of torque at 2,500 rpm. The V10 generates 310 horsepower at 4,250 and 425 lb-ft of torque at 3,250 rpm. A 7.3-liter turbodiesel V8 is also available, and it makes 250 horsepower at 2,600 and a dominating 505 lb-ft of torque at 1,600 rpm. All of these engines can be equipped with an optional automatic transmission. The F-250 can tow up to 14,500 pounds when properly equipped.To match your needs better, the Super Duty comes in Regular Cab, SuperCab and Crew Cab styles. The overall look is much more aggressive than the standard F-150, and its bigger dimensions allow Ford to use larger cabs without compromising load space. SuperCab models have small rear-opening doors, while the Super Duty Crew Cab has four full-size swing-out doors. A variety of optional equipment is available, including electronic shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive, a heavy-duty suspension package and telescoping trailer-towing mirrors.Inside, the roomy cabs have large, comfortable seats and generous seat-track travel. Five or six adults can ride inside with little problem as long as you choose the SuperCab or Crew Cab body. In addition, there are many interior convenience features designed for today's business owners. For example, a fold-down armrest and utility bin are designed to house a portable fax machine or laptop computer. For owners who don't want to skimp on luxury, leather seating is available on Lariat models.Given their size, the F-250 Super Duty trucks maintain a confident on- and off-road feel. They feature modern power steering systems and suspension components to improve vehicle ride, handling, responsiveness and maneuverability. Just don't mistake them for cars. The Super Duty is a true truck and rides harshly when not towing or hauling loads. Parking a Super Duty ranges from tedious (a mall parking lot) to impossible (some home garages and underground parking lots).The Super Duty isn't for everyone. Pricing on a diesel-equipped Crew Cab can approach $40,000. However, if you need more truck than the regular F-150 can provide, Ford has quite an impressive lineup of heavy-duty trucks to peruse.",V8 cylinder ,145," 350 lb-ft @ 2,500 ",, 6-speed manual 
Volkswagen,volkswagen passat,1996,volkswagen passat 1996,,,3.7,"Daytime running lights debut, two new colors are added to the palette, and a new price-leader GLS model powered by a 2.0-liter, 115-horsepower, four-cylinder engine is introduced.  Midyear, a Turbo Direct Injection (TDI) diesel model appears in sedan and wagon form. The Passat has never sold well in the United States.  Weak engines plagued the early editions, ineffective marketing has played a role, and a muddled brand identity that has defeated sales across the board have all contributed to this car's seemingly invisible presence on the sedan market.  Of course, its plain-vanilla styling didn't let the Passat stand out for much recognition other than the lack of a grille on the nose.Volkswagen has been trying to change things lately, and the Passat has received a good bit of attention.  The 2.8-liter V6 that has literally transformed Volkswagen's lineup from staid German sedans to road cars brimming with vitality was transplanted into the Passat.  Last year, a revised exterior design gave this Volkswagen more character, and included a grille for the first time.  Passats came fully loaded in one trim level for 1995; the only options were an automatic transmission, a sunroof and a CD player.  Antilock brakes and traction control were standard equipment.  With a singular GLX trim level, fresh styling, and renewed performance ability, Volkswagen focused the Passat's mission, and became the focus of people who appreciate quick, well-equipped German cars.  Priced in the low 20's, and equipped with a 10 year/100,000 mile warranty, the Passat GLX was a real bargain.It seems Volkswagen has decided to fiddle with the Passat recipe again, and we fear that the focus placed on the excellent GLX will become blurred with the arrival of newcomers.  Late last year, a bare-bones entry-level Passat GLS debuted with the meager 2.0-liter four cylinder from the Golf.  At $18,000, the GLS is no match for the Ford Contour SE, which offers the same tight European driving manners and a whole lot more speed for the same price.  Even Volkswagen's own Jetta GLS makes better sense, and you lose little interior room in the swap to the smaller VW sedan. Later in 1996, a TDI (Turbo Direct Injection) diesel model will arrive.  Volkswagen says this is one diesel that will be quick, clean and quiet.  We've followed a few test mules around on the streets of Tempe, Arizona and concur; the TDI loses nothing in acceleration ability to the GLS.  Still, the hit-and-miss availability of diesel fuel and relatively low prices for gasoline in the United States make us wonder why VW thinks North America needs a diesel Passat.The GLX is still the one and only Passat to consider, in our opinion.  It continues to offer an excellent blend of value, performance and exclusivity, in either sedan or wagon format.  So what do you think a fully loaded German sport sedan (or wagon) might cost?  The base price of a new Passat GLX is roughly equivalent to the price of a well-equipped Taurus LX.  Surprise, surprise.  We think you ought to try the Passat whether or not performance is important to you.  It's a good car at a fair price, with the ability to put a grin on your face every time you drive it.",V6 cylinder ,401," 173 lb-ft @ 4,200 ",, 5-speed manual

Nearly every automaker now  offers an EV or has announced plans to develop one. Some even plan to convert  entire fleets to electric within 10 to 15 years. Still, EVs have their  challenges: limited range, limited charging locations, lengthy charging  intervals. Some automakers — Toyota, Honda and BMW among them  — are hedging that hydrogen can be a viable gasoline replacement.  With the 2021 Hyundai Nexo, you can count the South Korean carmaker among that  number as well. 
The  Nexo is a crossover SUV that fits between the compact Hyundai Tucson and the  midsize Santa Fe. The Nexo's size gives it more utility than its two primary  sedan-based rivals, the Toyota Mirai and Honda Clarity, which cede a  significant chunk of interior and cargo space to accommodate large hydrogen  fuel tanks. The Nexo also rides higher off the ground, which should help its  appeal with crossover and SUV fans.
Enhancing  its forward-looking technology, the Nexo comes stocked with desirable comforts  and safety features, such as heated seats, navigation, and Apple and Android  smartphone integration. But you'll pay handsomely to drive the future because  the Nexo is priced more like a luxury SUV than your typical Hyundai vehicle.  You'll need to buy it in California, the only state where the Nexo is sold, and  you'll also need to accept a limited hydrogen refilling network that makes long  road trips impractical if not impossible.
The  Clarity and Mirai also cost roughly the same, so there's no discount in the hydrogen  game yet. Buyers inclined to sedans will find much to like in the Clarity and  Mirai. The Mirai, in particular, has been thoroughly redesigned for 2021 and  now looks more like a Camry than the slab-sided puffer fish of the former  generation. Overall in this group, we like the Nexo for its SUV practicality.  But the limits of hydrogen infrastructure confine the Nexo to a niche audience. You're  already paying a hefty premium for the Nexo's futuristic powertrain, so it  makes sense to spend a bit extra — about $3,500 — to get  the loaded Limited. It comes with  all available safety features (including the nifty blind-spot camera view) and  other upgrades such as hands-free liftgate and ventilated seats, which are  particularly useful in California.",Horsepower: 161  ,200, 291 lb-ft ,, 1-speed direct drive

A new 2.5-liter engine premieres this year, as do rear seat head airbags and a slightly freshened exterior. BMW also improved some of the optional equipment, including Park Distance Control for both the front and rear of the vehicle, a bigger LCD screen for the navigation system, and an optional single-disc in-dash CD player. Every vehicle in the 5 Series is a wonderful car. If you can afford to buy one, we recommend that you do. Sure, there are other great cars out there in this price range; we just think this is one of the best. The 5 Series follows BMW's fine tradition of embodying a ""true driver's car"" and is offered in four flavors for 2001 - the base 525i, the mid-level 530i, the top-level 540i and the high-performance M5. In addition to the sedan body style, a wagon (or estate, as they say in Deutschland) is also available in 525i and 540i versions.A new 2.5-liter inline six-cylinder engine that makes 185 horsepower moves the 525i models. This base model comes with a standard five-speed manual transmission, or it can be optioned with a five-speed Steptronic automanual transmission.Step up to the 530i and you get a new 3.0-liter inline six that makes a healthy 225 horsepower at 5,900 and 214 foot-pounds of torque at 3,500 rpm. This engine creates a broad torque band and offers commendable acceleration while meeting low-emission vehicle standards. Under the hood of the 540i sits a 4.4-liter, 32-valve V8 that manages zero-to-60 times in the low sixes. With 282 horsepower at its command, these Bavarian barnstormers are a blast on the open road. This powerplant comes mated to either a six-speed manual or a five-speed Steptronic automanual (the 540i Sport Wagon comes only with the auto) for those who find the BMW stick shifts a bit too demanding in stop-and-go traffic. The suspension is pleasantly firm on this lively model, making even the most docile of drivers feel like Michael Schumacher.Of course, if you really want to experience the pinnacle of BMW performance in a luxury sedan, skip the 540i and step up to the wonderful (and wonderfully expensive) M5 sedan. Its 5.0-liter V8 is good for 394 horsepower. Even with the M5's 3,800-pound curb weight, zero-to-60 acceleration happens in a lightning-quick 5 seconds! But don't expect those times to happen with both hands on the wheel; the M5's only transmission is a six-speed manual. Along with Corvette-like acceleration, the M5 features a lower ride height than you'll see on a standard 540i, aluminum suspension pieces, stiffer spring and shock rates, and 18-inch wheels with Z-rated tires.As one would expect in a top-end, luxury/sport vehicle, equipment levels are first rate. Standard fare includes a 10-speaker premium sound system, car and key programmable memory, dual-zone air conditioning, eight-way power adjustments with memory settings, and cruise control with steering wheel controls. All-Season Traction (AST), Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and Dynamic Brake Control are standard on all 5 Series cars.Standard safety equipment includes dual-stage front airbags, door-mounted front side airbags, and head-protection airbags for front passengers. The optional rear side-airbag package also includes head-protection airbags. Three-point seatbelts at all seating positions, impact sensors that unlock the doors and activate the hazard lights in the event of a serious accident, remote keyless entry, two-step unlocking, coded drive-away protection, and a vehicle security system are also standard. To list all of the 5 Series' luxury options would take more space than we have. A few of the more noticeable ones include a cold- weather package with heated front seats, Park Distance Control, a navigation system and 17-inch wheels with performance tires.

No other changes for the 1997 Accord. The benchmark.  The best-selling car in America.  The highest resale value in its class.  It needs a V6.  These are all statements that have been made with regularity concerning the Accord.  It is undoubtedly the most popular car in this country, despite what Ford (who includes fleet sales to such entities as rental car and government agencies in its sales totals for the Taurus) has claimed every year since 1992.  The Accord won a loyal base of customers by offering sprightly performance, room for four, frugal fuel economy and a virtual guarantee that, if cared for properly, the Accord would not break.Those qualities have made it the benchmark.  It is consistently the best-selling car to regular retail customers like you.  What about resale?  The current issue of Edmund's Used Car Prices says that a 1991 Accord EX sedan is worth approximately 64 percent of its original value.  Sure, the Accord is pretty pricey new, but the overall cost of ownership, when repairs, maintenance, and resale value are put into the equation, make it a bargain.During the 1995 model year, the Accord sedan finally got a V6.  However, it doesn't perform as well as some versions four-cylinder Accord.  Why?  Added weight, different tires, and an automatic transmission collaborate to make the Accord V6 slower and less nimble than a five-speed Accord EX.  Additionally, critics find that the V6 powertrain is not ideally suited to the Accord, citing smooth but dull response from both the engine and transmission resulting in a bland character; decidedly out of tune with other Honda products.  Hmmm...For 1997 Honda has dumped a few models, most notably the LX 5-speed with antilock brakes, and the leather-equipped EX coupes. The Accord EX equipped with a VTEC engine is quick, frugal, and loaded with equipment.  As an added bonus, it's fun to drive.

There is also a revised and more powerful turbodiesel V8 engine. The 2011 GMC Savana Cargo is a willing workhorse for buyers who require the functionality of a full-size van.  This year, the GMC Savana van turns 16. Obviously, full-size  cargo (and passenger) vans don't go through the vanity of a full redesign every  five years as with most cars. As such, the 2011 Savana Cargo sees only minor  changes this year that nonetheless add a bit more functionality and comfort to  this reliable workhorse.
Most notable is a new and more powerful 6.6-liter turbodiesel  V8. It's rated at 260 horsepower and 525 pound-feet of torque -- noticeable  upgrades compared to last year's 250  and 460 lb-ft. GMC says the new engine  also provides better fuel economy and reduced tailpipe emissions. An optionally  available compressed-natural-gas (CNG) engine offers green-minded business  owners another powerful engine choice.
The 2011 GMC Savana Cargo competes in a segment with but a  trio of other entries. Those rival work vans include the Chevy Express (the  Savana's GM twin), the Ford Econoline and the 2011 Mercedes-Benz  Sprinter. The Sprinter is the most modern, offering superior  maneuverability, fuel economy, cargo space and quality. But it also costs the  most and has only its lower-output diesel V6 for an engine choice.
The 2011  Ford E-Series Van is similar in size to its American rival and offers a  useful collection of ""Work Solutions"" features. But neither of the  Ford's two engine choices matches the Chevy's muscle. For something smaller, the 2011 Ford Transit  Connect might be worth a look. Yet thanks to its strong engine lineup and  multiple configurations, we think most contractors or business owners will be  quite pleased if they choose a 2011 GMC Savana for their full-size cargo van  needs. The rear-drive GMC Savana 1500 cargo van comes with a  4.3-liter V6 that produces 195  and 260 lb-ft of torque. Standard on  all-wheel-drive 1500s and optional on rear-drive 1500s is a 5.3-liter V8 good  for 310  and 334 lb-ft of torque. These engines are coupled to a four-speed  automatic.
The rear-drive-only 2500 and 3500 come standard with a  4.8-liter V8 that produces 280  and 296 lb-ft of torque. Optional engines  include a gasoline-fueled 6.0-liter V8 capable of 323  and 373 lb-ft of  torque, a CNG 6.0-liter V8 and a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8 good for 260  and  525 lb-ft of torque. These engines are coupled to a six-speed automatic.
Maximum payload capacity for a 3500-series van is 4,490  pounds while maximum towing capacity for the same is an impressive 9,700  pounds. All 2011 GMC Savana Cargo vans have antilock brakes and stability  control as standard equipment. Side curtain airbags are standard on the 1500  and optional on the others.
The GMC Savana  Cargo has not been rated using the government's new, more strenuous 2011  crash-testing procedures. However, its 2010 ratings (which aren't comparable to  the new methodology) in frontal-impact crash tests were a perfect five  stars for driver and front-passenger protection. A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models  only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2011 GMC Savana  Cargo respectable ride, handling and braking characteristics. With its various  powerhouse engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers are easily  accomplished, even when you're hauling a heavy load of cargo. As full-size vans  go, the Savana is pleasant to pilot -- just don't expect it to match the more  nimble Sprinter for maneuverability. The Savana's interior is built for functionality, not  fashion. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver,  but they're far from stylish. The front footwells remain as cramped as ever.  Unlike the Sprinter, the Savana Cargo lacks a tall-roof option that allows a  normal-size person to walk upright in the cargo area.
Savana Cargo buyers can opt for 60/40-split driver-side  doors or a passenger-side sliding door for easy access to the rear compartment  (60/40-split passenger-side doors are standard). Standard-length vans have a  maximum cargo capacity of 204 cubic feet, while extended-length vans check in  with a voluminous 237 cubic feet of space. 
Standard equipment on the Savana Cargo includes 16-inch steel  wheels, swing-out doors from the right side of the cargo box, air-conditioning,  front bucket seats, vinyl upholstery and a trip computer.
Options include alloy wheels, power windows and locks,  towing features, heated power mirrors, swing-out driver-side cargo box doors, a  sliding right-side door, a tilt steering wheel, cruise control, cloth  upholstery, a six-way power driver seat, a driver-only front seat, a variety of  rear door and window configurations, keyless entry, remote engine start,  Bluetooth connectivity, OnStar (with Directions and Connections), a simple  two-speaker AM/FM stereo and an upgraded stereo with a CD player and USB port.",,360," 260 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 4-speed automatic

Powerful Vortec engines and some unique features make the 2006 GMC Savana pretty much the only game in town if you're looking for a full-size van that doesn't look and drive like it was designed two decades ago. Originally introduced in 1965, GMC's full-size van has since undergone only one complete redesign. Constant improvements throughout the '70s, '80s and '90s kept it somewhat up to date, but not until a full redesign in 1995 did the GMC van become a legitimately modern vehicle. A new exterior look, new engines, extended body styles and improved ergonomics made the previous GMC Savana hard to overlook when compared with the aging Econoline from Ford. The current version incorporates some significant improvements like electronic stability control and powerful V8 engines that make the 2006 GMC Savana safer and more capable than ever before. Savana vans offer a choice of four power plants and either rear- or all-wheel drive. The standard engine on two-wheel-drive 1500 models is a 4.3-liter V6 rated at 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A 5.3-liter V8 with 295  and 335 lb-ft of torque is standard on all-wheel-drive 1500s and optional on rear-drive versions. The 2500 models come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 rated at 285  and 295 lb-ft of torque. The 3500 models come standard with a 6.0-liter V8 rated at 300  and 360 lb-ft of torque; this engine is optional on the 2500. All GMC Savanas come standard with a four-speed automatic transmission. The maximum trailer towing capacity for 1500s is 6,600 pounds. Standard-wheelbase 2500s can tow up to 8,000 pounds, while the 3500 can lug 10,000 pounds, properly equipped.  All Savana models have four-wheel antilock disc brakes standard. Light-duty models (GVW less than 8,600 pounds) feature a front-passenger sensing system that will deactivate the front airbag if it senses a small adult or child sitting up front. Heavy-duty models use a manual airbag deactivation switch for the front passenger. StabiliTrak stability control is standard on 3500 vans but isn't available on any other Savana. A reinforced frame, larger stabilizer bars, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and a recently upgraded brake system give the GMC van a leg up on the Econoline when it comes to ride and handling. Although the 2006 GMC Savana is still far from nimble, it's a better choice for day-to-day driving than the aged competition. And with three strong V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers come easily, even when you're hauling a heavy load.  The interior is built for pure functionality, and while it may not be pretty, it sure gets the job done. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but the footwells remain as cramped as ever. The standard configuration seats 12, with 8- or 15-passenger arrangements also available, depending on which model you choose. The standard wheelbase (135-inch) GMC Savana passenger van comes in half-ton (1500), three-quarter-ton (2500) and one-ton (3500) configurations, while the extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) comes as a 3500 only. There are two trim levels: LS and LT. LS models feature air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo and a theft-deterrent system. The more livable LT models include rear-seat climate controls, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and keyless entry. Optional equipment, depending on the model, includes driver-side swing-out doors, a passenger-side sliding door, power driver and front-passenger seats, alloy wheels and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer.",V6 cylinder ,250," 260 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 4-speed automatic

This five-door hatchback (or  ""coupe,"" in German automaker speak) has seating for five and improved  performance over A7 trims. Its twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V6 feeds 444  horsepower to all four wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. 
The  2022 Audi S7 comes standard with 21-inch summer tires. Among its performance  options are four-wheel steering, a sport exhaust and the Quattro sport rear  differential, which can bias torque between the rear wheels. In other words,  the S7 is an excellent choice for a driver-focused midsize four-door. With more  than a 100-horsepower increase over the base A7, it's significantly quicker and  more involving to drive.
Competitors to the S7 include the  Mercedes-Benz CLS, BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe and Porsche Panamera. To some degree  these all share the S7's swept-roof styling and inclination toward performance.  We  recommend the base Premium Plus trim. The S7 is already a better-equipped  model than the A7 even in its base trim, which includes plenty of tech and  luxury features.

EX and SE models have floor mats standard. Underpowered compared to the competition, but still an excellent choice for those wanting a comfortable and versatile mini SUV. If sport utilities were driven the way they were originally intended, you'd have a hard time convincing yourself that the 2001 Honda CR-V is the vehicle of choice. However, since most of the SUVs purchased these days spend all of their time on the road, the CR-V offers a great combination of a car-like ride and interior with truck-like visibility and ground clearance.Built on the Civic platform, the CR-V successfully integrates familiar Honda components into a visually pleasing design. The 2.0-liter, DOHC inline four-cylinder engine makes 146 horsepower and 133 foot-pounds of torque. Honda's familiar four-speed automatic transmission -- with an overdrive on/off switch -- or a precise five-speed manual gearbox put that power to the wheels and a four-wheel, double-wishbone suspension gives this vehicle its nice ride.The CR-V's Real Time four-wheel-drive system only applies power to the rear wheels when there is a loss of traction at the front. All 4WD models come with a five-speed manual transmission, while the four-speed automatic is optional. A front-wheel-drive model is offered, but it comes only with the automatic transmission. The result of using all of these car components is not surprising: The CR-V looks and feels like a car.The CR-V's interior is instantly recognizable to anyone who has spent time in Honda's passenger cars. Functionality takes precedence over style in the CR-V's cabin, and the result is easy-to-read gauges, well-placed controls (except for dash-mounted electric window switches), and high quality, if somewhat uninspired, interior materials. Cargo capacity is an impressive 67.2 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded. The CR-V offers comfortable chairs for its occupants, each of which provides excellent visibility and the ability to recline when the trip grows long. The front passenger benefits from a left-side armrest and rear passengers will enjoy the door-mounted cupholders.Available in either LX, EX or SE trim levels, the CR-V is surprisingly well equipped even in base LX form. Air conditioning with a filtration system is standard, as are power windows, power door locks, rear window wiper and defogger, AM/FM stereo with cassette, cruise control and a folding picnic table that doubles as a cargo area cover. Antilock brakes are available only on the EX and SE models, which also come with a CD player, remote entry system and alloy wheels. Checking the SE package adds a leather-trimmed interior, privacy glass, CD player, chrome grille accent and body-colored bumpers, side moldings and hard spare tire cover.The CR-V is not meant to compete against hard-core recreational vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler or Toyota 4Runner. Instead, it is meant for the person who wants the look and feel of a sport utility without having to pay an exorbitant sticker price and huge gas bills.

And the 2022 GMC Sierra 3500HD is about as capable as they come. It can pull up  to 35,000 pounds and haul more than 5,000 pounds of payload. You'd have to  search hard to find a load that would outmatch this heavyweight. Only a few  trucks offer the same performance and capabilities as the Sierra 3500HD, and a  couple of them — the Ram 3500 and Ford F-350 Super Duty particularly  — have an edge on the GMC thanks to roomy and more comfortable cabins  with slightly nicer interiors. 
That's  saying something, as the Sierra once held the distinction of being the most  handsome and best-dressed in this category. And certainly in its Denali trim,  the Sierra still impresses as a truck equally at home in the valet line or the  oil fields. The mechanically identical Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD offers nearly  all the same features in a slightly plainer — and cheaper —  truck-ish package. It's a viable option if capability and affordability are  priorities over style. Ultimately, the Sierra 3500HD easily satisfies if you're  looking for a rugged, dashing and massively capable pickup.  Given  the Sierra 3500HD's multiple trims and configurations, it's difficult to pick a  single model. Overall, the SLT probably  offers the best of all worlds, with a good mix of standard features and  available options, yet without the AT4's added off-road hardware or the  Denali's additional expense.

All A6s are now equipped with the high-tech Immobilizer III security system, side-curtain airbags, a 12-millimeter increase in the headrest height adjustment and an optional multifunction steering wheel. Refined and luxurious, the all-weather A6 family offers a satisfying alternative to the BMW 5 Series or Mercedes E-Class -- the 2.7T is our favorite. Four flavors of the A6 are available for 2001. The standard 2.8-liter V6, found in the base sedan and the Avant, brews up 200 horsepower and is mated to a standard Tiptronic automatic or an optional five-speed manual transmission. Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system is optional on the 2.8 and standard on all of the remaining models. This system constantly monitors the grip at all four tires. When one of them starts to lose traction, the quattro system automatically applies power to the tires with the most adhesion to the road surface. Audi's Electronic Stability Program (ESP), standard on the sedans and optional on the 2.8 Avant, applies brakes to the misbehaving wheel and gently points you back on your course. The A6 2.7T Sedan has a twin-turbo 2.7-liter V6 that produces 250 horsepower and 258 foot-pounds of torque. Audi has used two small turbos rather than one large one to make the engine more responsive. In a nice tip of the hat to enthusiasts, the 2.7T comes with a six-speed manual transmission as standard equipment. A five-speed Tiptronic-controlled automatic transmission is a no-cost option.The Audi A6 4.2 Sedan features the V8 normally found in the larger A8 Sedan. Obviously this is Audi's challenge to the V8-powered BMW 540i and Mercedes-Benz E430. The 4.2-liter engine produces 300 horsepower and 295 foot-pounds of torque, channeled through a five-speed Tiptronic-controlled automatic transmission. Beyond the engine, the 4.2 also comes with more aggressive styling, bigger wheels and tires, and more standard equipment. All A6 models feature an interior that is one of the best in its class. Audi greets drivers with a generous amount of supple materials and features. As a bonus, A6 buyers can choose from three different types of interiors. The atmospheres -- Ambition, Ambiente and Advance -- differ in their use of texture and appearance of the seat upholstery, and the color and type of genuine wood and aluminum trim. The A6's styling is unmistakably Audi, with a swept greenhouse and muscular fenders. However, the A6 isn't a stunner like the A4. The rounded sheetmetal and sharply creased trim detail don't blend well to our eye, and the taillights on the sedan appear to have been lifted from Chevrolet's lowly S-10 pickup. From some angles, the car looks great. From others, it appears somewhat dumpy and jumbled. Front overhang can appear especially out of balance. Fortunately, the gracefully swept greenhouse on both the sedan and wagon lends a touch of class and elegance to an otherwise characterless profile. Despite nitpicks, we believe the A6 is an enticing choice in the hotly contested luxury sedan class. If you're looking for a wagon, the A6 Avant should serve nicely, though it could use a boost in horsepower. Our personal favorite is the A6 2.7T. This version offers better acceleration than the 2.8 and nearly equals the 4.2. It also doesn't cost much more than the 2.8, and certainly costs less than the 4.2.

But more than 30 years later, the  2023 Lexus LS 500h continues to be the automaker's flagship sedan and a canvas  for tech, comfort and safety innovations. 
For  2023, the hybrid-powered 500h gets a new infotainment interface. It has a new  12.3-inch center touchscreen and finally dispenses with the clumsy toucad  control of earlier systems. (Hallelujah!) Features are now accessed through the  touchscreen or voice commands. The updated voice command system can respond to  natural speech and control media, navigation, climate and other functions.
Apart  from the fresh features in the tech department, the LS 500h remains a posh  luxury sedan that provides one of the most relaxing experiences of any car on  sale. The 500h is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 hybrid, making 354 horsepower.  That's underwhelming by large luxury sedan standards, but in return the 500h  gets an EPA-estimated 25 mpg in combined city/highway driving. This is the best  figure in the class, albeit by just a couple of mpg. 
We've  raved about this Lexus' sublime ride quality and noise control and appreciate  its use of high-quality materials in the cabin. The LS lacks the dazzling  exterior design to go with its ornate interior, which is perhaps one reason why  it doesn't attract as much attention as some of its German counterparts. The  Mercedes S-Class remains the segment all-star, though BMW has upped its game in  a big way with the new 7 Series. There is also renewed competition from the  Genesis G90. We like how Lexus updated the 2023 LS 500h's tech, but Lexus has  an uphill battle on its hands among this stellar group. This Lexus comes one way, and that's as the fully loaded LS 500h AWD. You can upgrade the car with optional paint colors, a different 20-inch wheel and special metal interior trim. Otherwise, Lexus includes everything as standard equipment.",V6 cylinder ,325,,,

A brighter Starlight Silver paint color replaces Canyon Stone Silver. A large cabin, excellent crash test scores, a reputation for reliability and a high resale value make this our favorite minivan on the market. Introduced just two years ago, the second-generation Honda Odyssey is currently recognized as the minivan benchmark, having thieved the crown from Chrysler shortly after its debut in 1999. Honda reliability, coupled with the largest interior in its class and useful features like a fold-flat third-row seat and second-row captain's chairs that can be slid together to serve as a bench are among the reasons the Odyssey has single-handedly revived interest in minivans.It's powered by a 3.5-liter, 24-valve VTEC V6 that produces up to 210 horsepower and 229 foot-pounds of torque, according to Honda. To get that kind of power requires 91-octane fuel, but with 87-octane, the engine makes 205 horses and 217 foot-pounds of torque. The V6 is based on the Accord's 3.0-liter engine but it offers more oomph, since the Odyssey's got a bit of extra girth. Still, acceleration away from a stoplight is somewhat leisurely, with power building in the mid-range where many Americans don't notice it. More low-end punch would be appreciated.The base LX model includes such standard fare as a height-adjustable driver seat, traction control, dual sliding doors, power windows (including power rear-vent windows), power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, a theft-deterrent system, front and rear air conditioning and antilock brakes. Step up to the EX and enjoy features like dual power sliding doors, a roof rack, keyless remote entry, an eight-way power driver seat, alloy wheels, a CD player and steering-wheel-mounted radio controls.Sitting on a four-wheel independent suspension, a first in the minivan segment, the Odyssey is supported comfortably and keeps the driver in touch with the road. Combined with the Odyssey's wide track, the suspension contributes a nimble and stable feel. Body roll around corners is well-damped for a vehicle of this size.A unique Odyssey feature continues to be its hideaway, or ""magic"" seat. With a minimum of effort and the use of just one set of hands, the rear seat can be folded out of sight and be flush with the floor in a matter of seconds. The second-row seats are convertible and can be used as separate captain's chairs or as a bench. A navigation system is optional on the EX and employs a single DVD disc for nationwide mapping. Sadly for some buyers, an on-board entertainment system is not available, and there is no leather upholstery option. Dealers with dollar signs in their eyes would be happy to add both to your Odyssey, for a premium, of course.A minivan would not be complete without safety features, and the Odyssey comes with its share. All seven seats have headrests and three-point seatbelts, both firsts in the minivan market. ABS, traction control and an Electronic Brake Distribution system (EBD) are also standard. In government and insurance institute crash testing, the Odyssey couldn't have scored better, getting five stars all around.

That's where the Silverado 2500HD comes in. Many people need the extra towing and payload capacity the 2500HD offers without having to move up to the 3500HD model. And in many cases, some people just simply want a larger and more powerful truck to drive around.  The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD's towing capacity maxes out at around 18,500 pounds when properly equipped, and it can carry close to 4,0000 pounds of cargo in its bed with the right configuration. These impressive numbers are in part thanks to the truck's powerful gasoline and turbodiesel engines. Chevy also offers the 2500HD in regular-, double- and crew-cab body styles, plus standard or long bed lengths, to further suit your particular needs. To help make towing easier, the Silverado 2500HD offers the Advanced Trailering System and a mobile app that provides custom trailering profiles, pre-departure checklists, trailer lighting diagnostics and more. The Silverado can also be equipped with eight cameras that provide 15 parking, driving and hitch viewpoints. Updates for the 2022 model year are minimal, but Chevrolet did make the handy Multi-Flex tailgate available on all trim levels. The Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD provides the power and capability you'd expect from a heavy-duty truck and a roomy and comfortable cabin. One of the truck's main drawbacks, though, is its interior. When compared to the Ford F-250 Super Duty or Ram 2500, the design looks dated, the material quality is lacking, and its tech is subpar. Despite that, we like the Silverado 2500HD and think it's a solid choice for people in the market for a heavy-duty truck. If you need a truck that's able to get the job done without many niceties, the WT or Custom trim should suffice. But if you want more than just basic features and the ability to add options and packages, the LT trim is the way to go. The LT trim adds more tech such as a larger touchscreen, onboard Wi-Fi and satellite radio.

We've also found that it's not quite as roomy as its closest competitor, the Ford Taurus X, nor larger crossover SUVs like the similarly priced Saturn Outlook that get near-equal gas mileage. Still, for an easy-to-drive crossover wagon, the Pacifica is certainly worth a look. The base front-wheel-drive Pacifica LX model has a 3.8-liter V6 producing 200  and 235 pound-feet of torque. It's hooked up to a four-speed automatic transmission. All-wheel-drive LXs and all Touring and Limited models feature a much stronger 4.0-liter V6 that generates 253  and 262 lb-ft of torque, backed by a six-speed automatic with manual shift control. EPA-estimated fuel economy for 2008 is similar for all models regardless of engine choice and drivetrain, ranging from 14¬-15 mpg in the city to 22-23 mpg on the highway. This mileage is slightly worse than large crossover SUVs like the Saturn Outlook and Mazda CX-9. All Chrysler Pacificas include antilock brakes with brake assist, stability control, full-length side-curtain airbags and a driver-side knee airbag. The 2008 Chrysler Pacifica scores a perfect five stars in the government's frontal- and side-impact crash tests, while the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gives the Pacifica a top rating of ""Good"" for frontal-offset crash protection. The 2008 Chrysler Pacifica delivers carlike handling from its Mercedes-Benz-sourced suspension and inspires more confidence than typical minivans and truck-based sport-utilities. Steering feedback is solid and precise, though some drivers might have an issue with excessive body motions over bumps. Pacificas with the smaller V6 labor under acceleration due to the hefty curb weight, though pickup with the 4.0-liter V6 is entirely adequate. Overall, the Pacifica provides more driving smiles than you might expect from such a versatile family hauler. Among crossover wagons, the Pacifica is a relatively upscale, well-appointed choice. The base Pacifica LX offers seating for five with a three-across second-row bench. Touring and Limited models feature second-row bucket seats and a split-folding third-row bench that accommodates up to six passengers in a two-two-two arrangement. Getting in and out is surprisingly easy thanks to a low entry height and upright seating. Both second- and third-row seats fold flat to optimize versatility. However, tight legroom in the third row means it's best used for small children only. Cargo room is generous, with a mammoth 92 cubic feet of maximum space in the LX and nearly 80 cubic feet in the Touring and Limited models (due to the third-row seat). The top-of-the-line Limited trim adds 19-inch chromed aluminum wheels, body-color fascias, a power liftgate, a sunroof, rear parking assist, laminated door glass, leather upholstery, heated front and second-row seats, wood trim, driver seat memory and a six-CD changer. Some of these features are available on lesser trim levels; other major options include a navigation system with a back-up camera, entertainment group with rear video screen, a premium Infinity surround-sound system, Bluetooth hands-free technology and xenon headlights.",V6 cylinder ,295," 235 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 4-speed shiftable automatic

Chevrolet,chevrolet spark,2019,chevrolet spark 2019,"['Impressive number of features at an affordable price', 'Offers many optional high-tech features', 'High fuel economy', 'Easy to park in tight places']","['Acceleration is slow, both for the class and in general', 'Not much rear legroom and cargo capacity']",4.7,"If  you're looking for a car that's small and efficient, with the creature comforts  typically found on much more expensive cars, the 2019 Chevrolet Spark could be  just the car for you. Its small size and good outward visibility make it a  breeze to park. Excellent smartphone connectivity technology is another draw  since every Spark comes standard with a touchscreen infotainment system that  has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration. The Spark, however, does have a couple of drawbacks. Acceleration is sluggish  off the line, even for the subcompact class. And while you shouldn't expect  loads of interior volume from a car like this, the Spark lacks rear legroom and  cargo space behind the rear seatbacks. On the whole, though, the 2019 Chevrolet  Spark should satisfy most of your needs. It's an affordable, well-equipped and  efficient mode of transportation. Though it's down on power and cargo space compared to other models in the subcompact car class, the 2019 Chevrolet Spark has its merits. It offers a high level of standard in-car technology, excellent fuel economy and an easy-driving demeanor. Edmunds has not driven any current version of the 2019 Chevrolet Spark, and we have limited experience with similar previous versions. The following is our take on what's significant about it and what you can expect. The 2019 Spark's small four-cylinder engine is best suited for around-town use. A CVT automatic-equipped Spark takes over 11 seconds to get to 60 mph from a stop, so highway on-ramps require some planning. Surprisingly, the Spark is agile around town and delivers a well-mannered ride overall. While it's noisy, the Spark compares favorably with other cars in the class. The seating position is upright, with minimal lateral support. The rear seats are best suited to smaller passengers. Yes, the Spark is small, but its interior layout is functional. The high roofline gives it decent access and visibility. But other subcompacts offer more rear legroom. There's minimal cargo room with the rear seat in use. But fold the seats down, and there's enough storage to tackle the typical sorts of errands that suit this subcompact hatchback. The infotainment system adds to the Spark's modern vibe. The menus are intuitive, and the graphics are sharp. The touchscreen supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. You can also get onboard Wi-Fi through the OnStar system. A big draw for the  Spark is its affordable pricing, but the base LS trim doesn't have some  features we think you'll want. As such, go with the 1LT trim. It's more  expensive than the base LS, but it has desirable extras such as full power  accessories (power windows, mirrors and locks), keyless entry and cruise control. All  Sparks come with a 1.4-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 98 horsepower  and 94 pound-feet of torque. The engine drives the front wheels through either  a five-speed manual transmission or a continuously variable automatic  transmission (CVT).The Spark LS comes with 15-inch  steel wheels, air conditioning, a rearview camera, a 7-inch touchscreen, Android  Auto and Apple CarPlay capability, Bluetooth and USB connectivity, a  four-speaker audio system, and Chevrolet's OnStar communications system that  includes a 4G LTE in-car Wi-Fi hotspot.The 1LT includes alloy wheels, power  accessories (windows, mirrors and door locks), cruise control, remote keyless  entry, foglights, and a six-speaker audio system.Next up is the Activ. It adds simulated-leather seating  surfaces, heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, roof rails,  special 15-inch wheels and bodywork, and a raised suspension that provides 0.4  inch of additional ground clearance.Alternately, go for the 2LT.  Compared to the 1LT, it comes with rear parking sensors, simulated-leather  seating surfaces, push-button start, an upgraded driver information display,  heated front seats, and chrome door handles and trim.A sunroof is optional for the 1LT and 2LT trims. For the 2LT only, you can get  a Driver Confidence package that adds forward collision warning system with  low-speed emergency automatic braking and a lane departure warning system.",Inline 4 cylinder ,290," 94 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",, 5-speed manual

It's armed with more horsepower, a stiffer suspension and more powerful brakes. As with other 2001 A8s, the 2001 S8 has the Electronic Stabilization Program (ESP) and the new multifunctional steering wheel as standard equipment. Want to drive the hero car from the movie Ronin instead of the BMW 7 Series or Mercedes S-Class? This is it -- minus the dual-tank nitrous system. Audi is making a dedicated effort towards bringing more performance-oriented car to United States consumers. This trend started in 2000 with the S4, and it continues in 2001 with the new S8.The S8 is a high-performance version of Audi's flagship luxury sedan, the A8.At the heart of the S8 is a five-valve, 4.2-liter V8 engine. Its modifications over the standard A8's engine include optimized intake paths, a new two-stage variable intake manifold, revised camshafts and a free flowing exhaust system. Thanks to these improvements, the S8's engine makes 360 horsepower at 7,000 and 317 foot-pounds of torque at 3,400 rpm. Other performance enhancements on the S8 include larger brakes, 18-inch wheels and a stiffer suspension.All of these improvements make the S8 even more fun to drive than the A8. This doesn't mean that the S8 has lost any of its real-world edge, however. It is still equipped with a five-speed automatic transmission and Quattro, Audi's all-wheel-drive system. Additionally, Electronic Differential Locking (EDL) provides low-speed traction control operating through the standard antilock braking system (ABS).  Electronic Braking-Pressure Distribution (EBD) is included with the ABS system, and ensures that maximum braking capacity can be utilized whenever needed, regardless of road or load conditions.Like the A8, the S8's body structure is made out of aluminum and is designed to provide lighter weight, superior structural rigidity, improved handling and responsiveness, better fuel efficiency and easier recycling. For safety, the S8 has dual-stage front airbags and side airbags for front and rear outboard occupants. Audi's Sideguard head airbag system consists of inflatable curtain airbags installed in the headliner along each side of the car, which cover the windows in the event of an accident and remain inflated for five seconds to protect the head in case the vehicle rolls over.Inside, drivers will find an interior slathered in real wood and Valcona leather upholstery. Front seats (with more supportive bolstering than the A8's seats) are power adjustable in 14 different ways, and a memory feature accommodates four different settings for the driver's seat, exterior mirrors, driver's headrest height and steering wheel position. The steering wheel tilts out of the way when the key is removed from the ignition. The automatic dual-zone temperature controls employ two sunlight sensors to help maintain accuracy.  With 360 horsepower, the S8 is aimed directly at other high-performance luxury sedans like the Jaguar XJR and the Mercedes-Benz S55. The S8 is shy on torque compared to these cars, but its all-wheel drive, lightweight structure, and long list of standard equipment should prove desirable enough to make it a worthy competitor.",V8 cylinder ,160," 317 lb-ft @ 3,400 ",, 5-speed shiftable automatic 
Chevrolet,chevrolet blazer,2000,chevrolet blazer 2000,"['Still-handsome styling, wide range of features and options, competent drivetrain.']","['Spotty build quality, cheesy interior parts, uncomfortable rear seats, no V8 option.']",3.6,"Base models are dropped. The engine, exhaust and ABS are refined for increased durability, and exterior trim on some models is modified. Two new colors are available. An aging design that can't match the competition in comfort or capability. Back in 1982, Chevrolet rolled out the S-10 Blazer, the first modern compact sport-utility vehicle.  Eighteen years later, the Blazer remains a strong seller in one of the hottest automotive markets. Take only one good look and it's easy to see why the attractive Blazer has such lasting appeal. Powered by a stout 4.3-liter, 190-horsepower V6 and available with several suspension choices, the Blazer can be tailored to specific needs, with either two-wheel or four-wheel drive, with two doors or four.There are accommodations for as many as six passengers in the bigger Blazer, if they don't mind squeezing. There's lots of cargo space too, with the spare tire mounted underneath the cargo floor on four-door models. Chevy claims that with the rear seat folded, a washing machine box will fit into the cargo bay. Sadly, the Blazer's interior is marred by acres of chintzy plastic and precious little rear foot room in front of a rather low and mushy seat.  Adult rear-seat riders are likely to complain loudly.Off road is not where the Blazer shines brightest, despite the availability of a ZR2 super-duty suspension package. Offered only on two-door 4WD models, the ZR2 Blazer has a special chassis with a wider track, huge 31-inch tires, specially tuned Bilstein 46mm shocks, and an underbody shield package. Regular Blazers are capable enough for two-track dirt, but serious off-road adventures would be better handled by something with a little more wheel travel.On the other hand, as a road-going hauler the Blazer is quite capable. All 4x4 models can be equipped with the available AutoTrac push-button electronic transfer case. AutoTrac automatically senses wheel slippage and sends power to the axle with the most traction, which makes those old full-time all-wheel-drive systems obsolete. This setup takes the guesswork out of sure-footed travel over wet or snowy pavement.GM's PassLock anti-theft system, automatic headlight control and four-wheel disc brakes are all standard. Heated exterior mirrors and an electrochromic rearview mirror are standard on LT models, and optional on the LS.  TrailBlazers come fully stocked with a long list of standard equipment.For 2000, Chevrolet has dropped base models from the roster, leaving three trim levels: LS, LT and TrailBlazer.  The automaker also has enhanced the durability of several key components ranging from the engine and airbag system to the brakes and exhaust.  Other changes are limited to minor trim modifications, two new colors and the addition of a CD player to uplevel sound systems. When the current Blazer debuted for the 1995 model year, it won the North American Truck of the Year award. Smart styling, a powerful drivetrain and reasonable pricing made it an instant hit. Lately, however, the bar has been raised over the Blazer, as most competitors have been completely redesigned or substantially improved since its debut. Simply put, with the new product in the compact-SUV world, this Chevy isn't the value it used to be.",V6 cylinder ,354," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 5-speed manual

More than 40 years after the 1953 Corvette debuted, Chevrolet introduces the fifth-generation Corvette for 1997.  The C5 almost didn't happen.  Originally scheduled for release in 1993, the Corvette was killed for a short time before performance zealots within General Motors resuscitated the project and made the new car happen.Pushrod power continues, in the form of a reworked 5.7-liter V8 engine dubbed the LS1.  Horsepower is 345 at 5,600 rpm, while torque measures 350 ft-lbs. at 4,400 rpm.  The result?  Equipped with the standard four-speed automatic transmission, the Corvette will hit 60 mph in a shade over five seconds.  Opt for the six-speed manual transmission and you'll cut less than half a second off the trap time.  To help reign the power in on slippery surfaces, acceleration slip regulation is standard equipment.  EPA mileage figures are phenomenal for a high-powered sports car; the Corvette will return 28 mpg on the highway with the manual tranny.Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes keep stopping distances short with larger rotors than last year.  Front tires are 17 inches in diameter, and rears are a whopping 18 inches across, which contributes to an excellent .93g of road grip.  The rubber stays planted well too, thanks to a fully independent four-wheel short/long-arm height-adjustable suspension.Body panels are still composed of a material other than metal, though no longer fiberglass.  Sheet molded compound wraps around a new, ultrastiff structure that features a full-length perimeter frame with tubular steel side rails.  The windshield frame is aluminum, and the instrument panel is attached directly to a beefy cross member designed to reduce noise and vibration.  A sandwich composite floor with a lightweight balsa wood core damps noise and vibration while making the floor exceptionally stiff.Inside, a new dashboard with real analog gauges and intuitive radio and climate controls greets passengers.  Luggage space beneath the rear hatch glass is an incredible 25 cubic feet, made possible with the use dual mid-ship mounted fuel tanks that are snuggled within the Corvette's structure.  The car feels more airy inside, thanks to a narrower door sill and taller height combined with a low cowl.Yes, the Corvette is an outstanding effort and competes favorably with the best in the class.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a million bucks, to our eyes.  Long, low, and lean, the Corvette is certainly attractive.  We take issue, however, with the thick truncated tail and the odd-looking air scoops for the front brakes.  Other critics have complained of derivative styling cues and the lack of chrome-finished exhaust tips.  Still, the Corvette's new shape will wear well into the next century.Don't let the fact that the C5 will swallow two golf bags sway you into thinking this a gentrified sporting coupe.

Bmw,bmw 7-series,2002,bmw 7-series 2002,"['Advanced powertrains, sumptuous luxury, technology showcase.']","['Toys can be distracting from the task at hand, odd styling details.']",4.4,"Completely and controversially redesigned, the 2002 BMW 7 Series arrives chock-full of innovative technology and luxury trimmings. The new BMW 7 Series is probably the most technologically advanced passenger car in the world, but is it too complex? Leaves change colors, birds fly south, and every few years, BMW must make changes to its cars. We didn't feel that the previous 7 Series was getting long in the tooth by any stretch of the imagination, but the wizards of Bavaria needed to showcase all the latest hoopla gadgetry in some form, so they chose their flagship sedan. The new 7 will be available as a regular-wheelbase 745i or a long-wheelbase 745iL. Powering each model is a 4.4-liter V8 with bi-VANOS dual variable valve timing. This V8 makes 325 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque, and BMW says fuel economy is improved by 14 percent. A six-speed automatic transmission, the world's first, utilizes shift-by-wire technology and is controlled using a selector lever on the steering wheel. Initially, automanual shifting (Steptronic) will not be offered in the U.S. Acceleration to 60 mph is expected to take just over 6 seconds for the full-size 745i. About a year after the 745 debuts, a 760iL will land on our shores, sporting a 6.0-liter V-12 making 408 horsepower and 442 pound-feet of torque. An all-aluminum suspension with Automatic Ride Stabilization (ARS) and continuously adjustable Electronic Damper Control (EDC) is standard. Both work to keep the car's cornering stance flat and control body roll as tightly as a girdle. The rear suspension features automatic load leveling. The driver may choose between comfort and sport settings. Safety is ensured by numerous airbags, including a head protection system for front and rear passengers. Front seats feature active headrests.Optionally available is an Active Cruise Control (ACC) system. ACC works similarly to intelligent cruise control systems offered by Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti; it monitors the distance between the 7 Series and the car ahead and adjusts speed accordingly to maintain a safe distance.While this is all well and good, the most important innovation contained in the new 7 is the iDrive system. All critical elements needed for driving are arranged on and around the steering wheel. iDrive controls the remainder of the new 7's gadgets, such as on-board telematics (including GPS navigation, Internet access and the new ASSIST emergency notification system), as well as climate and stereo functions. A stubby rotary push-button dial (dubbed The Controller) mounted in the center console and a control display screen mounted to the top-center of the dash allegedly allow the driver to operate these functions without taking his or her eyes away from the road. That remains to be seen, as we have not conducted a test drive of the new 7 Series yet. According to BMW, iDrive will allow the development of a system called ConnectedDrive. What is ConnectedDrive? BMW says it ""uses and links innovative technologies in the three areas of telematics, online services and driver assistance systems."" By networking all of the new Seven's electronics systems together, BMW aims to provide as serene and safe a driving experience as is possible in a modern automobile by offering technologies that come very close to doing the driving for you. Examples of what BMW has in the pipeline include the following: Adaptive Light Control (by consulting the navigation system, the headlights track curves before you see them), Active Steering Wheel (again using navigation, steering will help keep the car on the intended path, but the driver will easily be able to overcome the ""assistance"") and Active Gas Pedal (the accelerator will exert force against the driver's foot when the car determines that it would be prudent to slow down. Navigation mapping and road conditions would determine when this system engaged, but the driver could easily defeat it). Also coming is Bluetooth linking technology, allowing the new Seven to communicate with PDAs, computers and mobile phones.There are too many technological details to go in-depth here; needless to say, the new 7 Series will be an interesting barometer to see where the future of driving is headed. Is it merely a means through which to be shuttled to and fro in a high-tech mobile office?

The lineup has been simplified to a single model called the ""X3 3.0si"" equipped with the latest generation of BMW's 3.0-liter, inline six-cylinder engine. In this application, it makes 260 horsepower. BMW has also revised the front and rear exterior styling; introduced new wheel designs; and tweaked the interior with a new three-spoke steering wheel, a new hood over the instrumentation and revised leather and plastic materials. Beyond all that, the stability control system now incorporates ""Brake Fade Compensation,"" ""Brake Drying"" and ""Start-off Assistant"" technologies. Looking for a small SUV that performs like a sport sedan? The 2007 BMW X3 fulfills that role nicely, as long as you don't mind its big price tag and unusually firm ride. Like other crossover SUVs, the 2007 BMW X3 is based on a unibody car platform. However, unlike other crossover SUVs, the car platform the X3 is based upon is BMW's perpetually praised 3 Series sport sedan. And that's the strongest element of this rather small, but very athletic machine.While the X3 features BMW's X-Drive all-wheel-drive system, this is not a machine built for off-road exploration. The X-Drive system lacks a low range for serious muck extraction and the suspension doesn't have the long travel needed to climb boulders. Instead, the X3 is built to deliver an exciting all-weather, on-road driving experience with some of the best steering and handling of any small SUV. And it has an exceptionally eager power plant that, unlike virtually every other small SUV, is offered hooked to a six-speed manual transmission. As in every BMW, the best seat in the X3 is the driver seat.Yes the X3 is also luxurious, but in an understated way; there's very little chrome anywhere on the vehicle and the on-board entertainment system options don't include video monitors to entertain the children. Instead there are well-shaped seats covered in perfectly stitched hides, easily read instrumentation, sweet wood accents and switches that operate with the precision of a surgical instrument.Sure the X3's ride can be stiff, the interior is versatile but there's not a lot of it, and compared to other crossover SUVs its size this one is expensive. But this is the BMW of small SUVs. Every 2007 BMW X3 3.0si is powered by a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine rated at 260 horsepower and 225 pound-feet of torque. That engine comes lashed to either a manual or Sportmatic automatic six-speed transmission feeding into BMW's X-Drive full-time all-wheel-drive system. BMW claims the new engine should significantly improve acceleration with the manual-transmission X3 3.0si getting to 60 mph in 6.9 seconds and the Sportmatic doing the trick in 7.1 seconds. The X3's safety systems are all integrated into BMW's ""Intelligent Safety and Information System"" which places redundant systems throughout the vehicle so even if some are damaged the various safety technologies aboard will function properly. Those include two-stage airbags in front, front and rear side curtain airbags, front-seat side impact airbags (similar airbags are optional for the rearward seats) and an aggressive stability control system that now includes brake fade compensation, brake drying, brake standby and start-off assistance. If you judge luxury crossover SUVs solely by how well they navigate a slalom course, then there's no better one on the market (with the possible exception of the Acura RDX) than the 2007 BMW X3. The steering is simply the best, the engine is joyous to use, the suspension is nimble and the brakes are effective. But if what you're looking for is something to haul a big family cross-country in maximum comfort or creep along a trail, there are better choices. There's not a lot of room inside the X3, but what there is is well thought out and beautifully executed. The decoration is more sophisticated than opulent, with excellent switch feel and plenty of storage cubbies strewn about. The audio and ventilation controls can be confusing the first, second or 40th time a driver attempts to use them, but once mastered they return precise adjustments. Overall it's an environment geared for serious driving rather than entertaining diversion. Stand-alone options include 19-inch wheels and tires, park assist, an upgraded sound system, a navigation system, new 16-way ""Comfort"" seats and adaptive xenon headlights.",Inline 6 cylinder ,225," 225 lb-ft @ 2,750 ",, 6-speed manual

The more interesting aspect of the 760Li is that it's the first BMW with direct gasoline injection, which, in combination with the Valvetronic technology already used in the 745 models, allows for stellar performance, and according to BMW, ""outstanding fuel economy."" We'll wait and see on that one. In other news, all models get rear head-protection airbags, and Active Cruise Control finally makes it to the options list, along with run-flat tires. The Rear Comfort Seat package for the 745Li now includes rear-seat ventilation.

The 4.4-liter V8 has been upgraded to make 290 horsepower, up from last year's 282. The X5 now offers such goodies as enhanced Hill Descent Control, trailer stability control and a self-leveling suspension. A CD player finally makes its way onto the standard equipment list. If you've got too much money and desperately need the SUV image (but don't really care about SUV utility), the X5 will ring your bell. With an ever-increasing demand for luxury SUVs, BMW bowed to the gods of market share and introduced the X5 for the 2000 model year. But BMW knows that most luxury SUV buyers spend about as much time off-roading as they do in the 99-cent store. These customers are looking for a palatial and secure environment to carry them between business meetings and soccer games. Here the X5 scores, with leather and wood interior surfaces, a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system, front and rear electric seating adjustments, a navigation system, advanced ABS, rear climate controls and a total of 10 airbags. Crash-testing of the X5 has allowed it to set new standards in front- and side-impact protection. From a pure safety standpoint, the X5 is truly impressive.Exterior dimensions for the X5 put it at roughly the same size as the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Its short overhangs and compact size (it's 4.5 inches shorter than a 5 Series sedan) add to the sport-activity vehicle's maneuverability claims. Unfortunately, these same dimensions add up to less interior space than a 5 Series wagon, which costs less and offers superior handling. Of course, the X5 still features the BMW styling cues we've come to expect, including a twin kidney-shaped grille, quad headlights and L-shaped taillights.The X5 is produced at the Spartanburg plant in South Carolina and comes with either a 224-horsepower 3.0-liter V6 or a 290-horsepower 4.4-liter V8 engine. Performance with the larger engine is brisk, scoring a sub-8-second 0-to-60 time. This year, BMW introduces the X5 4.6is, a performance-tuned model similar in philosophy to the Mercedes ML55 AMG. How quick is the X5 4.6is? Sixty mph comes up in about 6.5 seconds. Keeping this hot-rodded X5 glued to the ground is a sport suspension with the third-generation of BMW's Dynamic Stability Control and exclusive 20-inch alloy wheels. So concerned were engineers about the handling prowess of their new baby, they ensured a low center of gravity by routing the driveshaft for the front wheels through the oil sump to keep the engine mounted as low as possible. Exclusive interior colors and materials, unique exterior colors and special exterior trim all call attention to the fact that the 4.6is is the flagship BMW SUV. The body-color front air dam with lower air intake scoops and side wind splitters sits beneath standard xenon headlights. In back, a body-color rear air dam with wind splitters on the sides is punctuated by dual chrome exhaust pipes. All X5s get an enhanced Hill Descent Control (HDC) system and a new trailer stability control system. HDC acts as a reduction gearbox when the vehicle is traveling forward or backward, limiting speed regardless of the angle of descent. Trailer stability control recognizes the natural tendency for a trailer to sway as it is towed and adjusts the X5's braking forces and engine torque to help bring the swinging trailer under control. Also new? A 7,700-pound tow rating.Finally, a self-leveling suspension became optional in late 2001, allowing the X5 to be raised and lowered for loading/unloading and entry/exit. An inch of extra ground clearance is also available for off-road purposes, but don't mistake these recent upgrades as an attempt to turn the X5 into a serious all-terrain vehicle.

The Kentucky-built Avalon features new styling inside and out, enhanced safety features, increased engine performance, and more comfort and convenience than its predecessor. A comfortable, though pasteurized, full-size sedan. It would seem buyers of full-sized sedans generally aren't too interested in character. Most full-size sedans are dull pieces of machinery to look at and a snooze to drive. The beauty in such a vehicle lies in what it can do for the customer in terms of providing space for people and things without compromising the ride or occupant comfort. It should look upscale, but not gaudy, providing just enough glitz and luxury to let others know you have achieved a degree of success in life. Finally, such a vehicle must also be reliable and able to handle years of daily-driver tasks without so much as a whimper.Since its introduction in 1995, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description. A little bland, perhaps, but solid, roomy, and dependable. For 2000, the Avalon enters its second generation. Substantial changes have been made to improve its already good traits, as well as add a bit of excitement. There are two models: XL and XLS. The main difference between the two is the level of standard equipment. Both can be ordered with front bucket or bench seats.Avalon's 3.0-liter V6 engine now features a variable valve timing system (Toyota calls its system VVT-i). The system provides additional horsepower, improved fuel economy and torque, lower emissions and smoother shifting. The previous Avalon was no slouch, so the engine improvements are just icing on the cake.Toyota has also updated the styling. A side benefit of this is a reduction in noise, vibration and harshness (NVH).  Comfort amenities include a new dual-control air conditioner, an optional JBL premium grade audio (standard on the XLS), and an improved multi-information display. There's also increased trunk volume, grocery bag hooks, and a larger storage tray and cargo net.  A universal remote system that can be programmed to open garage doors, gates and turn on house lights is standard on XLS models.Safety is enhanced with an optional package on XLS models that includes Vehicle Skid Control (VSC) and traction control. VSC utilizes the braking system to correct understeer or oversteer conditions in a turn.  Traction control reduces tire slippage during acceleration.  Toyota also added a brake-assist feature that detects emergency braking and applies supplemental line pressure to reduce stopping distance.Additional new safety features include a stronger body structure that effectively absorbs and diffuses energy along predictable paths, added energy absorbing material to the roof rails, front pillar and center pillar to help reduce potential head injury, and enlarged rearview mirrors.  The front seats have been strengthened and a rear center adjustable headrest has been added.We recommend that potential buyers of a new full-sized sedan take a look at the 2000 Avalon. As before, its price is more than the offerings from Detroit like the Buick LeSabre, Dodge Intrepid and Ford Crown Victoria. But unflappable quality has a price.

Audi,audi s4,2009,audi s4 2009,"['Plentiful power, standard all-wheel drive, attractive and well-crafted cabin.']","[""Cramped backseat, convertible's aging design.""]",4.8,"For 2009, the Audi S4 sedan and wagon have been temporarily discontinued as Audi readies new versions based on the latest A4 generation. The convertible version of the Audi S4 carries over unchanged. The 2009 Audi S4 is still a decent high-performance small luxury car, although the aging Cabriolet is rapidly becoming eclipsed by competitors. A forthcoming all-new sedan and wagon should thrust the S4 back near the head of the pack. When Audi released its latest-generation S4 in 2004, it broke new ground by stuffing a 4.2-liter V8 under the S4's relatively compact hood. This, along with a sport-tuned suspension, bigger wheels and more powerful brakes, allowed the S4 to take on any of its high-performance German competitors. But times have changed. No longer is 340 horsepower a jaw-dropping spec in this segment, and nonperformance versions of rival cars now match (or beat) the S4's specs.For the 2009 Audi S4, only the convertible version remains as a carryover from last year. The sedan and wagon have been dropped, as Audi is presumably readying new versions. A fully redesigned A4 sedan appeared this year, and it will serve as the template for the new S4 when it debuts. As for this year's S4 convertible, it maintains its good looks and excellent interior quality, two of the model's best selling points.Because other brands have considerably upped the ante on their high-performance models, the S4 convertible no longer directly competes with the likes of the BMW M3. The Audi now sits, price- and power-wise, between the 300- BMW 335i convertible and the 382- Mercedes-Benz CLK550. From this vantage point, the 2009 Audi S4 remains a solid choice for those looking for extra oomph in their small luxury convertible. The Audi S4 is fitted with a 4.2-liter V8 that makes 340  and 302 pound-feet of torque. Power is sent through either a six-speed manual gearbox or a six-speed automatic. The latter transmission allows manual-style shifting via steering-wheel-mounted paddles. The standard Quattro all-wheel-drive system employs a 40/60 front-to-rear power split in normal situations to give the car a more dynamic attitude when cornering. Audi claims that an S4 Cabriolet with the manual transmission can sprint from zero to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds.Fuel economy for the 2009 Audi S4 cabriolet is rated at 13 mpg city/19 mpg highway and 15 mpg combined for the manual transmission, and a slightly better 14/21/16 mpg for the automatic. Stability control, antilock disc brakes with brake assist and front-seat side airbags (for both chest and head protection) are standard on the 2009 Audi S4 convertible. Even though its numbers aren't comparatively as impressive as they once were, the 2009 Audi S4 Cabriolet still packs plenty of power and ability. The S4's top-notch underpinnings result in excellent handling on demanding roads, while still maintaining a comfortable ride. The Audi doesn't offer the precision handling of BMW's 3 Series, but the extra traction provided by the all-wheel-drive system just might make the S4 worthwhile, especially in areas of the country where otherwise sun-loving drivers have to navigate through inclement weather in the winter months. Like every Audi, the 2009 S4 convertible features superb materials, excellent fit and finish, and efficient controls (although the optional navigation system isn't particularly user-friendly). The two-person rear seat is fine for children and small adults, but otherwise it's cramped. Cargo space is decent for a compact luxury convertible; total luggage capacity is 10.2 cubic feet, more than its German rivals. Options include heated rear seats, a navigation system, a rear parking system, iPod connectivity and a Convenience package that adds 18-inch wheels, auto-dimming mirrors, driver-seat memory and a Bose premium sound system.",V8 cylinder ,300," 302 lb-ft @ 3,500 ",, 6-speed manual 
Chevrolet,chevrolet express,2010,chevrolet express 2010,"['Robust engines, multiple wheelbase and passenger configurations, available all-wheel drive.']","['Cheesy cabin plastics, less interior space than the Sprinter van, no tall-roof option.']",4.1,"For 2010, the Chevy Express 2500 and 3500 models get a standard six-speed automatic transmission that improves low-torque and fuel economy. There are other powertrain changes as well, including a slight power bump for the 5.3-liter V8 (now 310 horsepower) and flex-fuel E85 compatibility. Finally, remote engine start is now an option. The 2010 Chevrolet Express is a willing workhorse for buyers who require the functionality of a full-size van. The current-generation Chevrolet Express turns 14 this year, and to celebrate its lengthy time on earth since its last complete redesign, Chevy has given its full-size passenger van a bit more power for its 5.3-liter V8 and a six-speed automatic for its 6.0-liter V8. Not exactly the gifts you'd expect for a teen, but then again, Jonas Brothers tickets or an Xbox wouldn't be realistic options for a giant people carrier.If you need room for eight, 12 or 15 passengers, your choice in normal passenger vehicles is restricted to the Express, its GMC Savana twin, the Ford Econoline and the Dodge/Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. The Sprinter is the most modern among these, offering superior maneuverability, fuel economy, passenger space and build quality, but it is also more expensive. On the other end of the spectrum, the Econoline is going into its 18th year since its last total overhaul. It's basically the same size as the Express, but both of the Ford's engines offer significantly less power than the Chevy's base 5.3-liter V8. The optional 6.0-liter V8 is the most robust engine in the full-size passenger van segment.Since the Chevy Express hasn't changed much over the years, one could buy a used model and reap substantial savings for what would be pretty much an identical vehicle. But for business or institutional owners in need of a new workhorse van, the 2010 Chevrolet Express is a very logical choice. The Chevy Express 1500 is powered by a 5.3-liter V8 with 310  and 334 pound-feet of torque. A four-speed automatic and rear-wheel drive are standard, and all-wheel drive is optional. The maximum towing capacity with this engine is 6,200 pounds. Fuel economy is 13 mpg city/17 mpg highway and 14 mpg combined.The rear-drive-only 2500 and 3500 get a 6.0-liter V8 with 323  and 373 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic is standard. The maximum towing capacity for a properly equipped 3500 model is 9,900 pounds. All 2010 Chevrolet Express passenger vans have standard antilock disc brakes, stability control and side curtain airbags (for the first three rows of seating). In government frontal-impact crash tests, the Express scored a perfect five stars. A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2010 Chevy Express respectable on-road characteristics. With a pair of strong V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers are easily accomplished, even when you're hauling a heavy load of passengers and cargo. As full-size vans go, the Express is pleasant to pilot -- just don't expect it to match the more nimble Sprinter for maneuverability. The Chevy's interior is built for functionality, not fashion. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but they're far from stylish. The front footwells remain as cramped as ever. The standard configuration seats eight, with 12- and 15-passenger arrangements also available, depending on which model you choose. There is only one roof height available, so compared to the Dodge Sprinter, it is more difficult to walk around inside to reach the rearmost rows of seating. The standard-wheelbase (135-inch) 2010 Chevrolet Express van comes in a base 1500 configuration as well as the heavier-duty 2500 and 3500. It seats eight to 12 passengers. The extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available only as the 3500 and includes a 15-passenger capacity. There are two trim levels: LS and LT. LS models are geared toward fleet service, so equipment is limited to features such as 16- or 17-inch steel wheels, passenger-side rear swing-out doors, air-conditioning, an AM/FM stereo, a theft-deterrent system and vinyl upholstery. The more livable LT models include auxiliary rear air-conditioning and heating, power windows and locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and keyless entry. Most of these upgrades are optional on the LS. Other options include power driver and front passenger seats, a sliding passenger-side door, alloy wheels, remote engine start and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer.",V8 cylinder ,195," 334 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",, 4-speed automatic

The 2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee WK is the  previous-generation version of this SUV, which the automaker is selling  alongside the new, completely redesigned Grand Cherokee. By carrying the old  Grand Cherokee forward, Jeep is able to keep the Grand Cherokee supply lines  full while offering its customers a more affordable way to buy the SUV. The  ""WK"" refers to an internal code designation Jeep uses for the  vehicle. 
The  Grand Cherokee WK, though, is a mere shadow of its former self. Jeep has cut  the luxurious trim levels from the roster, the Trailhawk off-roader also gets  the old heave-ho, and the V8 engine option is history. It comes in only two  trim levels, each equipped with the standard V6 engine and rear-wheel drive or  four-wheel drive. Only four paint colors are available, and seating comes with  cloth, artificial suede or leather upholstery.
Still,  though the Grand Cherokee WK is advanced in age, its appeal endures. From a  design that has aged remarkably well to its impressive off-roading capability,  6,200-pound towing capacity and overall utility, the Grand Cherokee WK remains  attractive to people who want a Jeep. It also carries a base price thousands  less than the redesigned fifth-generation Grand Cherokee. In addition, it includes  Jeep Wave Customer Care, which provides complimentary scheduled maintenance and  other perks for the first three years of ownership. So value is part of the  equation here.
Potential  downsides include a dated technology stack that can't match the all-new Grand  Cherokee for sophistication, along with less-than-stellar safety ratings by  today's standards. But if you're on a tight budget, need a talented off-roader  that cleans up well enough for nights out, or want to tow a heavier trailer  than most midsize SUVs can, the Grand Cherokee WK might be the right SUV for  the job. The  Grand Cherokee WK's primary appeal is in its base price, so we recommend the Laredo trim. You'll forgo leather  seats, but you can dress the Laredo up with an X package that adds artificial  suede upholstery and an Altitude package with body-color and gloss-black  exterior details, giving this aging Jeep a custom look.",V6 cylinder ,138," 257 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 8-speed automatic

Sure, there are other  high-dollar luxury coupes out here, but they don't have a hybrid powertrain,  especially one as unique as the LC 500h's. It consists of a 3.5-liter V6, two  electric motors and a battery pack that's mounted between the rear seats and  trunk. That might seem like a pretty ordinary hybrid setup until you get to the  transmission. Lexus pairs a continuously variable transmission with a  four-speed automatic, a combination designed to simulate 10 gears.  
The  LC 500h's unconventional transmission routes all 354 horses to the rear wheels,  which was enough for a swift 0-60 mph time of 5.0 seconds when we tested it.  Surprisingly, that's just 0.1 second slower than its V8-powered counterpart,  the LC 500. The glorious sound of the V8 is of course missing, but in return  you get 29 mpg combined, 10 more mpg than the non-hybrid. 
Unlike  the LC 500, the LC 500h isn't offered as a convertible, but both share a  stunning exterior design, a remarkable-looking interior made with top-notch  materials, a comfortable ride, and ample amounts of luxury. The grand-touring  coupe also provides solid handling dynamics, which Lexus improved for 2023 by  adjusting the suspension settings. And its regenerative braking system, common on  all hybrids, does impact pedal feel, hampering the LC 500h's driving dynamics. 
The LC 500h doesn't have any direct rivals because there isn't much interest in six-figure hybrid luxury coupes; most are powered by potent V8s. The plug-in hybrid version of the Porsche Panamera comes close, but it has two extra doors. If you're set on the LC 500h, one thing is certain: You'll be driving around town in rarefied air. There  aren't any trim levels to recommend for the Lexus LC 500h because it's only  available in one well-equipped configuration featuring several available  packages and options.

After a man vacationing in Utah snapped an unofficial spy photo of the redesigned Grand Cherokee and posted it on his website earlier this summer, hype over the much-anticipated remodeled Jeep escalated.  Why?  The photo showed a sleek, beefy sport-utility vehicle worthy of the Grand Cherokee nameplate.       Receiving its first redesign since its introduction, designers treaded a fine line between incorporating new devices and retaining the traditional components that make a Jeep a Jeep.  Signature items like the vertical slot grille and trapezoidal wheel openings remain, but are altered just enough to change the total look of the vehicle.  The truck gets a toothier, raked grille that is less angular than the previous model, a steeply angled windshield, an arced roof and stretched wheel arches.  Using the same 105.9-inch wheelbase from the Jeeps of old, engineers made the truck longer, higher and wider than before.  We are happy to hear that step-in height is reduced by an inch while the driver seat gains an inch in height for those commanding views sport-utility connoisseurs love. Inside the truck, you'll find an extra inch of headroom in front and an extra .5 inch in the rear, along with 1.2 more cubic feet of cargo room.  Thankfully, the spare tire is relocated to beneath the floor of the cargo area.  Jeep public relations executives are also clamoring about a ""new level of luxury"" and improved ergonomics inside the vehicle.    The 1999 Grand Cherokee will be offered with two new engines, but only one will be available in North America: the 4.7-liter V8 Power-Tech engine, which produces 235 4800 rpm.  Replacing the current 5.2-liter engine, this SOHC, 16-valve Power-Tech V8 makes 295 foot-pounds of torque @ 3200 and has better fuel economy than its predecessor.  The other engine available for North American consumers is the old 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder, which has been refined for more power and lower emissions.Other improvements to the truck include standard all-wheel antilock brakes and full-time 4WD.  The new braking system has electronic brake distribution capability, which makes for a quieter, less pulsing and more balanced braking experience.  Possessing the largest brake rotors in the sport-utility segment, the Grand Cherokee meets or exceeds requirements for passenger vehicles, which are stricter than those for light trucks.  The Quadra-Drive four-wheel drive system has never been used in a sport-ute, until now.  The system keeps the vehicle moving even if only one wheel has traction.While Jeep boasts about its testing of the Grand Cherokee's off-road capability on the Rubicon Trail, these sport-utes are rarely taken far from modern asphalt, making the on-road ride far more important to the suburbanites who will buy the vehicle.  Recognizing that truth, a new automatic transmission has been introduced that will increase initial acceleration and provide smoother shifting between gears.  Steering ability has also been enhanced and the new Grand Cherokee has a turning radius that is one foot tighter than the older model.  The three-link rear suspension offers a smooth, car-like ride and reduces body lean, while the new hydroformed tubular control arms are five times as stiff as the previous design.

Midyear a new M-Edition debuts, sporting Marina Green paint and chromed alloy wheels. Summertime brings the limited-production STO-Edition, of which 1,500 were produced. After eight years, Mazda's MX-5 Miata is still the best roadster on the market today. Sure, Germany has unleashed the BMW Z3, the Mercedes SLK, and the Porsche Boxster, but none of them can match the Mazda for sheer bang for the buck. The MX-5 Miata is about simplicity in design and operation. It's about having fun behind the wheel. It's about feeling free and young on warm summer nights. Not a serious car, the Miata, but that is this Mazda's charm.Knuckleheads driven by large quantities of testosterone will dismiss the Miata as a woman's car. They don't know what they are talking about. Purists will dismiss the Miata in favor of the German convertibles, citing bloodline and heritage as worthy attributes that the Mazda does not possess. These are people who haven't driven either car, in most cases. We've driven all but the Boxster, and while some members of our staff refuse to openly admit that the Miata is the better car, it is an unspoken understanding that Mazda builds the superior roadster.For 1997, Mazda introduces an enticing package that eschews several unnecessary items included in the Popular Equipment Package, though we think the cost-cutters should have gone even further toward making the new Touring Package more affordable. The Touring Package contains necessities like power steering, alloy wheels, and power mirrors. It also contains unnecessary items like power windows, door map pockets and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Continuing are the Popular Equipment Package, Leather Package, and R Package. Antilock brakes and air conditioning are stand-alone options.Colors are limited to red, white, black and blue. Interiors can be covered with black cloth or tan leather. A premium sound system pumps bass through the seat and is perfectly audible at speeds above 80 mph. True enough, it doesn't take long for the price of a new Miata to reach the mid-20s, but the base model with the Power Steering Package remains mighty affordable and is just as much fun to drive.M-Edition fans weren't disappointed this year. In March, a Marina Green M appeared, sporting wood interior trim, unique gauges, and chromed alloy wheels. A full compliment of standard equipment came with the M-Edition, including leather interior, premium sound system with CD player, and air conditioning.Summertime brought a limited-production version of the Miata called the STO-Edition. Advertised only in Miata Magazine, the STO represented 1,500 units of the final run of first-generation Miatas. Painted Twilight Blue and featuring a tan leather interior and tan top, the STO had mesh-type alloy wheels, Nardi leather shift knob, the lip spoiler from the R Package, headrest speakers, and the Touring Package. Of all the production Miatas, this is the one for collectors.Bad news for Miata fans; 1997 is shaping up to be the last year for the current design. Industry rumors indicate Mazda is readying a new Miata for 1998, though we cannot believe that product planners would stray too far from the immensely popular and successful original formula. A warning to Mazda: remember the New Coke debacle.The MX-5 Miata is a car that every auto enthusiast should drive at least once in their lifetime.

High fuel economy? These are normally two qualities that are  hard to find in one vehicle and yet the 2021 Lexus RX 450hL (mostly) pulls it  off. The 450h designation means this is the hybrid version of Lexus' midsize  SUV. It gets an EPA-estimated 29 mpg in combined city/highway driving, which is  well above average for this class of vehicle. Then there's the L designation at  the end, indicating this is the longer, three-row RX version.  
Unfortunately,  that third row is quite cramped and best left for occasional use by small  children. The RX 450hL also suffers from a lack of cargo space and a suboptimal  infotainment interface that's distracting to use while driving. Still, it will  be hard to find a similar mix of luxury, fuel economy and passenger capacity  elsewhere. Plug-in hybrid versions of the Lincoln Aviator and Volvo XC90 will  be your best bet for a roomier SUV, but know that they're considerably more  expensive.

Subaru,subaru impreza,1996,subaru impreza 1996,,,4.5,"The formerly optional 2.2-liter engine is standard across the board, except in the new budget-minded Brighton AWD Coupe.  A new grille accompanies the bigger engine, and a five-speed is available as well. Subaru built a solid reputation for itself in the Seventies building inexpensive (and built to stay that way) four-wheel drive passenger cars.  The company enjoyed success in the Northeastern and Northwestern U.S., providing people with reliable transportation that could thwart most attempts by Mother Nature to keep them from arriving at their destinations.  Aside from a major rusting habit and offbeat styling, Subarus kept loyal owners happy.Then Subaru decided it wanted a bigger piece of the auto market pie.  The Impreza was originally conceived to battle the Ford Escorts, Toyota Corollas and Chevy Cavaliers that sold so well to young adults.  A zippy ad campaign touting the Impreza as What to Drive alienated traditional Sube buyers and turned off the young adults it was supposed to appeal to.  Sales of the Impreza were less than successful, and Subaru scrambled to find a solution.Wonder of wonders, the company has decided to reacquaint itself with its legend.  Subaru is concentrating on all-wheel drive cars again, and is emphasizing AWD in every ad, article and brochure you can lay your hands on.  The Impreza is available with AWD in coupe, sedan and wagon form.  Traditional front-wheel drive editions are also on the roster.For 1996, Subaru has banished the anemic 1.8-liter engine from most of the lineup, infusing nearly all Imprezas with the 2.2-liter engine found in the Legacy.  Formerly found only in uplevel Impreza LX models, the 2.2-liter package includes a new grille, a rear stabilizer bar, and wider tires.  For the first time in the Impreza, buyers can opt for a five-speed transmission with the 2.2-liter engine.Other changes include the addition of power locks and windows to upper trim levels, and the addition of a new AWD Brighton Coupe, a budget four-wheeler saddled with the old 1.8-liter engine and skinny 14-inch tires.Overall, we find much to like about the Impreza.  The AWD LX Coupe we examined sported nice styling, attractive alloy wheels, and an ergonomically-correct cabin.  The Coupe was new to the Impreza lineup for 1995.  We found the LX Coupe to be a stylish, sporty all-weather transpo device.Imprezas also come in sedan and station body styles.  The wagon has a small cargo area, partially due to the steeply raked rear window.  Impreza prices start near $13,000 and can top out over the $20,000 mark.  That's too pricey for a compact, and pricing is one of this car's problems.Other quibbles include a cramped rear seat, narrow front seats, ugly plastic wheelcovers on the Outback wagon, and a funky smell in all the new Subarus we've encountered.  Add in cost considerations, and we can only recommend the Impreza in AWD form to those who live in remote snow-bound areas of the country.",Flat 4 cylinder ,148," 140 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",, 5-speed manual

Like the rest of the 7 Series, the 740i has a standard equipment list that will leave the Sultan of Brunei drooling with desire. The big news for big Bimmer fans this year is the reintroduction of the regular wheelbase 740i. It seems that there are enough fans of the ""little"" 7-Series to justify its continued existence in the US. We agree; the cozy 5-Series is a wonderful car, but we think that rear seat passengers will appreciate the room afforded by the larger 740i. With the second coming of the 740i, the 7-Series offers a variety of models to compete not only with the gargantuan Mercedes and Jaguars, but also with the merely large Lexus LS 400 and Infiniti Q45.Those who can't live without the finer things in life, will want to check out the amazingly appointed 750iL.

Compared to the previous generation, this year's model is a huge leap forward. Major gains have been posted in terms of power, handling, traction and style. Freshly redesigned for 2007, the new Acura MDX is a luxury SUV built with enthusiasts in mind, offering the sort of performance that puts it on par with the segment's Teutonic leaders. When it was introduced five years ago, the Acura MDX was a respected entry in the luxury SUV segment, offering tons of features and excellent build quality for a reasonable price. Still, rivals such as the BMW X5 and Mercedes-Benz M-Class outgunned the MDX in overall performance. For 2007, the MDX gets a top-to-bottom overhaul that closes the gap between it and its German rivals. Re-imagined as a sleek blend of family hauler and performance machine, the 2007 Acura MDX is miles ahead of its predecessor; enthusiasts will love it, and it's still able to comfortably manage both kids and groceries following a weekend trek to Trader Joe's.The midsize ute is powered by the largest and most powerful V6 ever to grace an Acura, giving it unparalleled juice and athleticism. A dual-stage intake manifold and a very high (11.0:1) compression ratio allow this engine to perform like a V8, while retaining the fuel-efficiency of a V6. The ute's handling also benefits from an all-new chassis and the addition of an electromechanical all-wheel-drive system first seen in the RL sedan. This SH-AWD system can not only actively shift torque from front to rear, but also from side to side in order to maximize traction and stability in all situations.But the upgrades don't stop with performance. The MDX raises the bar when it comes to luxury, offering a full complement of electronic and telematic features. Standard features include tri-zone climate control; an eight-speaker 253-watt audio system with XM satellite radio and auxiliary jack for personal audio input; and Bluetooth connectivity. A navigation system with real-time traffic, surround sound audio and rear-seat entertainment is also available.With big fish like the BMW X5, Porsche Cayenne and Volvo XC90, Acura's hauler swims in an extremely competitive pond. But the ute's makeover has been a complete success. The 2007 Acura MDX is our pick for the best midsize SUV, surpassing its rivals on the strength of its performance and wealth of safety and luxury features. Under the hood is a 3.7-liter V6 good for 300 horsepower and 275 pound-feet of torque. The engine is mated to a five-speed automatic transmission with SportShift manual capability. An electromechanical all-wheel-drive system keeps this Acura's wheels firmly glued to the pavement. Maximum towing capacity is 5000 pounds. The 2007 Acura MDX is no slouch when it comes to safety. Standard safety equipment includes front seat-mounted side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, active front head restraints, stability control with a stabilizing feature for trailering, a tire-pressure monitoring system and antilock disc brakes with brake assist. The 2007 Acura MDX handles with a nimbleness that surprised us. Equipped with the Sport package, the MDX's two-mode dampers soak up the bumps when necessary and firm up when the pace quickens. Overall, the MDX demonstrates a quickness and dexterity that makes it every bit as confidence-inspiring as high-performance rivals like the Porsche Cayenne and BMW X5. With high-grade materials quality and a bevy of electronic features, the seven-passenger MDX's cabin is a comfy and luxurious place to be. The interior achieves a certain degree of versatility thanks to 60/40-split folding second-row seats and 50/50-split folding third-row seats. Cargo room with the seats up is a decent 15 cubic feet; fold them down and capacity grows to a generous 83.5 cubic feet. The Technology package adds a navigation system with voice recognition and real-time traffic, a surround-sound audio system, a rearview camera and solar-sensing climate control. The Sport package includes the features of the Technology package, and throws in an Active Damper System sport suspension, special wheels and perforated leather trim. Finally, an Entertainment package can be had with either the Technology or Sport packages, and includes a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, heated second-row seats, a remote-linked power tailgate and a 115-volt power outlet.",V6 cylinder ,200," 275 lb-ft @ 5,000 ",, 5-speed shiftable automatic

Roomy on the inside and agile out on the road, the 2006 Ford Expedition is a solid choice among full-size SUVs.  A general sense of dissatisfaction spread over Fordland in the mid-'90s when it realized that GM held a monopoly on full-size SUVs with its Tahoe and Suburban. With SUV sales booming and consumer trends pointing toward a desire for bigger and more powerful vehicles capable of hauling as many as nine passengers or more than 100 cubic feet of cargo, Ford found itself without a competitive edge in a hot market niche. When the redesigned F-Series pickup debuted for 1997, Ford engineered a proper large SUV on its platform.The Ford Expedition was introduced with much fanfare that same year, finding favor among buyers whose only other choices were GM SUVs built on the decade-old C/K pickup frame. The Expedition was stiffer, powered by more modern overhead cam engines, and sized to slot nicely between the SUV twins from Chevrolet and GMC. For 2003, the Expedition was completely redesigned. Bigger, more comfortable, more refined and easier to drive, the redesigned Expedition competes favorably with the SUVs from General Motors, Nissan and Toyota, offering family-friendly features and creature comforts not found in competing vehicles. There is plenty to like about the super-sized 2006 Ford Expedition, and those shopping for such a vehicle will certainly want to take it under consideration. All Expedition models come standard with a 5.4-liter V8 that makes 300 horsepower and 365 pound-feet of torque. Although a little sluggish down low, this engine is extremely smooth, quiet and rich in midrange torque. A four-speed automatic transmission is standard across the line; all trims are available with either two- or four-wheel drive. A heavy-duty rear differential gives the Expedition a maximum tow rating of 8,900 pounds. The Ford Expedition received double five-star ratings in front crash tests performed by the NHTSA. All Expeditions come standard with four-wheel antilock disc brakes enhanced with Electronic BrakeAssist and Brakeforce Distribution. Optional safety systems include a tire-pressure monitor system, side- and head-impact protection for first- and second-row passengers and the AdvanceTrac stability control system with Roll Stability Control for added protection against rollover accidents. The Ford Expedition's fully independent suspension and rack and pinion steering system provide solid handling for a vehicle of its size. It still feels like a big SUV, but the steering is nicely weighted and body roll is well controlled around turns. The ride can be a tad harsh on rough roads, but overall, it's a comfortable cruiser. The torquey V8s from Nissan and GM still have the 5.4-liter beat when it comes to power, but Ford's V8 is tops in refinement.  Expeditions seat anywhere from seven to nine passengers, depending on whether you go with captain's chairs or bench seats. Sticking with the 40/20/40 second-row bench seat will allow you to scoot the middle section forward for easier access to a little one. The Expedition's 60/40 third-row seat is one of the more comfortable in the full-size SUV class and it folds flat with a quick and easy release handle. Six trim levels are available on the Ford Expedition: XLS, XLT, XLT Sport, Eddie Bauer, Limited and King Ranch. The base XLS model is decently equipped with a front bench seat, a CD player, air conditioning, a third-row seat, automatic headlamps and full power accessories. The XLT offers a few more comforts, including running boards and a rear air conditioner, while opening up all the desirable options. The XLT Sport version adds tubular step bars, Shadow Gray exterior trim and a revised grille. Those seeking even more features can choose the Eddie Bauer model with leather upholstery (optional on XLT models), automatic climate control, memory seat controls and an in-dash six-disc CD changer. The Limited adds unique wheels and exterior trim, eight-way power front seats with heating and cooling, and plenty of wood trim. The King Ranch package includes unique interior and exterior trim, higher-grade leather seating, wood interior trim and upgraded alloy wheels. Options include a load-leveling air suspension, second-row captain's chairs, a CD-based navigation system, a rear DVD entertainment system, a power-folding third-row seat and tire-pressure monitoring.",V8 cylinder ,73," 365 lb-ft @ 3,750 ",, 4-speed automatic

A V6 engine paired with dual  electric motors helps this RX hybrid return 29 mpg combined, well above average  for its type, while three rows of seats offer flexibility for ferrying a small  family or friends out for the night. 
The  RX 450hL may sound like something from a lab manual, but it's really just the  elongated hybrid version of Lexus' best-selling RX 350. Docile handling and a  cushy ride make the 450hL more of a cruiser than its twitchier RX F Sport  counterpart, a feeling enhanced by its hushed interior and soft leather.  Unfortunately, that serenity doesn't extend to the cramped third row, which is  useful in a pinch for adults but best suited to small kids. And with just 7.5  cubic feet behind the third row, there's not even abundant cargo space to  justify the tight quarters. By comparison, the rival Lincoln Aviator offers 18  cubic feet. Lexus also persists with its clumsy toucad infotainment interface  (perhaps for not much longer, as newer Lexus models suggest), but touchscreen  control has thankfully been added for both the standard 8-inch display and the  optional 12.3-inch screen.
Despite  its flaws, it's hard to find the 450hL's mix of luxury, fuel economy and  passenger capacity elsewhere. The Lincoln Aviator and Volvo XC90 are roomier  plug-in hybrid SUVs, but they also cost considerably more. For its price and  performance, the RX 450hL hits a sweet spot. The  RX 450hL offers just a single trim level. It's well stocked, but we'd suggest  adding the Navigation package for a  larger touchscreen, upgraded infotainment and the 12-speaker sound system. We'd  probably also spring for the heated seats à la carte.",V6 cylinder ,275," 247 lb-ft @ 4,600 ",,

A 138-horsepower 1.8-liter four-cylinder resides under the hood, and the interior decor is rather austere compared with the increasingly plush innards of other 3 Series cars.

The 2009 GMC Savana is a willing workhorse for buyers requiring the functionality of a full-size van. In full-size-van years, 13 is on the young side. That's how long it's been since the GMC Savana last received a full redesign, which makes it considerably younger than the hoary Ford E-Series. As such, we're not going to give GMC a hard time for letting its full-sizer stand pat for this model year. The 2009 GMC Savana does just about everything a big van should, lacking only the Dodge Sprinter's tall-roof option and superior fuel economy.There have been numerous updates over the course of the life cycle of General Motors' full-size vans, the Savana and the Chevrolet Express. Notably, '03 saw the arrival of updated V8 engines, available all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements. Though the interior materials and switchgear are still nothing to write home about, they did receive some refinements last year. Short of a complete overhaul, the 2009 GMC Savana is about as good as the General's full-size van is going to get.With room for up to 15 passengers, beasts of burden like the Savana are ideal for those who want to ferry around large numbers of people without going all-out and buying a bus. As such, the Savana is a logical choice for churches, schools and other institutions with large-scale transportation requirements. The more modern Dodge Sprinter makes for a superior shuttle, however, thanks to its taller roof, better road manners and superior fuel efficiency. It's more expensive, though, so if you don't want to break the bank, the Savana should be fully up to the task. The standard engine in Savana 1500 models is a 5.3-liter V8 making 301 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque. A 6.0-liter V8 rated at 323  and 373 lb-ft of torque is standard on 3500s. All 1500 models use a four-speed automatic that sends power to the rear wheels, while 3500s get a heavy-duty version of that transmission. An all-wheel-drive configuration is also available for the 1500. The maximum towing capacity on 1500 models is 6,300 pounds, while the heavy-duty 3500 can pull up to 7,600 pounds when properly equipped. All models have standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes, stability control and side curtain airbags (for the first three rows of seating). In frontal-impact crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2009 GMC Savana scored a perfect five stars for both driver and front-passenger protection. A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2009 GMC Savana respectable ride and handling characteristics. With a pair of strong V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers are easily accomplished, even when you're hauling a heavy load of passengers and cargo. As full-size vans go, the Savana is pleasant to pilot -- just don't expect it to match the European-style driving dynamics of the Sprinter. The GMC Savana's interior is built for functionality, not fashion. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but they're far from stylish. The front footwells remain as cramped as ever. On the bright side, the optional 60/40-split driver-side doors facilitate access to the rear seats. The standard configuration seats 12, with 8- and 15-passenger arrangements also available, depending on which model you choose. The standard-wheelbase (135-inch) GMC Savana full-size van comes in half-ton (1500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations. The extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available only on the 3500. There are two trim levels: LS and LT. LS models are geared toward fleet service, so standard equipment is limited to features such as air-conditioning, an AM/FM stereo and a theft-deterrent system. The more livable LT models include auxiliary rear air-conditioning and heating, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and keyless entry. Optional equipment groups are extensive, with features like power driver and front passenger seats, alloy wheels and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer.",V8 cylinder ,185," 325 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",, 4-speed automatic

As an all-around three-row luxury SUV, it's been one of  our favorites. Now Audi has given the 2020 Q7 a number of additions that should  make it an even smarter buy than before.  Enhancements  start with the exterior styling. A more aggressive-looking front end visually  tightens up the overall proportions so the Q7 appears more muscular. Audi's LED  matrix headlights come on certain trims. These lights can provide better  illumination of the road than traditional headlights while also minimizing  glare to oncoming drivers. While they aren't approved for use in the U.S. quite  yet, Audi says owners will be able to update the software at a dealer once the  government approves the design. The rear styling, too, has been updated to  bring it in line with some of Audi's newer models. Inside,  Audi has installed a new infotainment system with dual touchscreens. This is  the same system Audi has been putting in its latest vehicles, such as the  related Q8 SUV. The dashboard and center console have been updated, too, to  accommodate the new system. The overall look is new and modern, which we like,  but we've also found that this new touchscreen system can be distracting to use  while driving. There  are a few under-the-hood changes as well. The Q7's upgraded engine is now a  turbocharged V6, replacing last year's supercharged V6. The new engine makes  more power, and based on our initial testing of the 2020 Q7, it definitely  feels quicker around town than last year's model. Unfortunately, fuel economy  has taken a hit. According to the EPA, fuel economy for the turbo V6 is down 3  mpg combined compared to the older engine.Overall,  however, we still expect the 2020 Audi Q7 will remain one of the top contenders  in the three-row midsize luxury SUV market. Whether you're looking for luxury,  performance, utility or a mix of all three, the Q7 easily hits the mark. Try  getting the midlevel Premium Plus to  maximize value. True, even the base Premium is packed with features, but you do  get some valuable extras here, such as a wireless phone charger, an upgraded  sound system and a blind-spot monitoring system. As for the Q7's engines, you  can certainly get by with the four-cylinder, but the V6 provides quicker and  more satisfying acceleration.",Inline 4 cylinder ,195," 273 lb-ft @ 1,600 ",front wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

It's an affordable option if you aren't ready  for an all-electric vehicle but want something that is efficient and offers an  all-electric driving range. Its hatchback body style offers more cargo space  than a sedan, and owners are eligible for a federal tax incentive because it's  a plug-in hybrid.  
When  fully charged, the Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid can drive up to 29 miles on  all-electric power. After that, it operates like a regular hybrid and achieves  52 mpg in combined driving. For 2022, Hyundai updated the Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid  with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, but only with the  standard 8-inch touchscreen.

Besides  being affordable and efficient, the Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid is packed with lots of  tech and advanced driver aids and comes with a long warranty. It's not without  drawbacks, though. As with most hybrids, its acceleration is slow. The Ioniq  Plug-In Hybrid's ride quality could also be better, and plenty of road noise  manages to make its way into the cabin. But it's still a compelling choice for  a plug-in hybrid. The Ioniq Plug-In Hybrid's closest rivals are the Toyota  Prius Prime plug-in and Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid.

Oddly reclined seatbacks.'],4.7,"The two-door model gets the ax this year. Rear-seat passengers are cooled by a newly optional rear air conditioning system. A host of new standard features has been added, including carpeted floor mats. Three new colors spruce up the outside a bit, and second-generation airbags are standard inside. Until this year, General Motors had a lock on the midsize sport-utility market, but couldn't build enough to meet demand because of a serious lack of production capacity.  The result?  Inflated prices as dealers struggled to keep the Yukon and its Chevrolet Tahoe twin in stock.  Then, GM refurbished a plant in Arlington, Texas, (which used to produce full-size Buick, Chevrolet, and Cadillac sedans) and Yukon/Tahoe production was effectively doubled.Unfortunately for GM, the additional plant capacity may have come a bit too late.  Ford released the midsized Expedition last year, and this F-150 pickup-based SUV is more refined but less powerful than the GM twins.  This year, Dodge releases the Durango, based on the fresh Dakota platform and sure to be slightly smaller and easier to maneuver than the GM and Ford behemoths.  And Lincoln is assaulting our eyesight with the overdone Navigator, which is currently selling faster than condoms at a drive-in theater.  Since four-door SUVs sell much better than two-door models, the smaller Yukon has been retired from the lineup this year.In the size race, the remaining Yukon four-door fits squarely between the Jimmy compact and the big-bruiser Suburban wagons.  Squint your eyes, in fact, and the difference between a Yukon and Suburban begins to evaporate, despite the latter's extra 20 inches of steel.  Ford's Expedition is a bit larger than the Yukon, while the Dodge Durango is slightly smaller.  Both of these competitors offer eight-passenger seating, which is not available on the Yukon.Yukon's interior has been borrowed from the full-size Sierra pickup.  This year, the airbags are of the reduced force second generation variety.  Carpeted floor mats and a carpeted reversible cargo mat are standard equipment.  Also standard for 1998 is a power driver's seat, a theft-deterrent system, an electrochromic rearview mirror, and a new automatic 4WD system on K-series models.  Rear air conditioning is newly optional, as is a Luxury Convenience Package that includes heated seats, heated exterior mirrors, a power passenger seat, and a HomeLink transmitter.  How does the Yukon stack up against the Expedition?  The Ford is more refined and comfortable, but we prefer Yukon's dated exterior styling and more maneuverable size.  Smooth overhead-cam engines power the Ford, but we prefer the torque and roar of GMC's Vortec 5700 V8.  Neither is easy to climb into, particularly without running boards, but the Yukon's lower ride height makes access much easier.  As drivers, we prefer the Yukon's powerful engine over the Expedition's refinement.  Naturally, though, you can still expect truck-style ride and handling, but reasonable comfort on the road.With new competitors arriving annually and increased production capacity, GMC dealers have little reason to gouge customers on Yukon pricing.  Just threaten to go down the street and pick up a new Ford Expedition, Lincoln Navigator, or Dodge Durango; the dealer should be eager to play ball.",V8 cylinder ,255," 330 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

New exterior colors and option package content shuffling sum up the obvious changes for 2001. A capable compact pickup with a variety of body styles to suit most buyers. The 2001 Toyota Tacoma has a reputation for reliability, but value in question due to high asking prices. Toyota's sixth-generation compact pickup debuted seven long years ago with a new name: Tacoma. It's supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure, but a friend of ours once quipped, ""Obviously, nobody from Toyota has actually been to Tacoma.""  Regular Cab, Xtracab and new-for-2001 Double-Cab bodies are available, with either two- or four-wheel drive. Double-Cab models are exclusive to North America, and are not dressed-up versions of the company's four-door commercial truck sold in overseas markets. Double-Cab features 11 inches of ground clearance, and a 61.4-inch long cargo bed. Also new this year is a StepSide bed option package for 2WD Tacomas, and the sporty S-Runner model.  S-Runners, offered only with 2WD, include special trim, wheels, a 190-horsepower V6 and a sport-tuned suspension. Tacoma is aggressively styled, inside and out, and for 2001 a fresh front look ties the truck more closely to its larger Tundra brother. Available in base, mid-grade SR5, sporty S-Runner or upscale Limited trim, Tacomas can be dressed in chrome or body-color accents, as the buyer wishes. Interiors are industrial in design, failing to appear modern, but are constructed of high-quality materials. Seat comfort, however, is not best in class.The PreRunner model is available with SR5 or Limited trim. It is designed to attract truck buyers who desire, but cannot afford, a 4WD truck, 4WD truck owners who don't use their 4WD as often as they expected, and 2WD truck buyers who take their vehicle off-road. Historically, a ""pre-runner"" is a truck that pre-runs an off-road racecourse. Toyota's PreRunner has benefited from considerable suspension tuning and development work with Toyota Motorsports desert racing truck program to produce a 2WD vehicle with 4WD capabilities. Any of three potent engines go under the hood. Two-wheel-drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated at 142 horsepower and 160 foot-pounds of torque. Tacoma 4x4s and 2WD PreRunners earn a 2.7-liter four with 150 horsepower and 177 foot-pounds of torque. Standard on Double-Cab and optional on Xtracab models is a DOHC, 24-valve V6 that whips out 190 horses and 220 foot-pounds of torque. With V6 power, the Tacoma can tow up to 5,000 pounds when properly equipped. A supercharger is available from Toyota Racing Development (TRD) for the V6, boosting output to 260 horsepower. Ask your dealer for details.All Tacomas have front coil springs instead of torsion bars, but 4x4s and PreRunners feature longer suspension travel to improve ride/handling qualities. Four-wheel antilock braking is optional on all Tacomas, and all pickups contain dual front airbags with a shut-off switch for the passenger's side.Toyota hopes to attract buyers with the handsome styling and rugged image of its Tacoma as well as its reputation for quality and reliability. Generally, we like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents. Most of these Toyota trucks don't come cheap.

Ask any Subaru executive and she'll tell you to take one part popular Australian movie star and one part advanced all-wheel-drive system. Stir in an undercurrent of SUV backlash with a dash of resurgence in the station wagon market, and behold: the perfect environment for the Subaru Outback.       Available in either wagon or sedan form, the Outback is Subaru's answer to the question: Why would anyone want to drive an ill-handling, gas-guzzling, difficult-to-park SUV? With 7.3 inches of ground clearance, standard all-wheel drive and a base price in the low 20s, the Outback offers on-road practicality with off-road capability at a bargain price. While no match for the likes of Jeep's Grand Cherokee or Toyota's Land Cruiser in terms of hill climbing, the Outback can hold its own in light to moderate off-road situations without losing an oil pan or cracking a differential.     A Phase II 2.5-liter, 16-valve, 165-horsepower boxer engine, producing 166 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm, powers the Outback Wagon and Outback Limited Wagon and Sedan models. The all-new-for-2001 Outback H6-3.0 L.L.Bean Edition and Outback H6-3.0 VDC are both powered by an all-new 212-horsepower, DOHC, 24-valve, high-output six-cylinder engine mated to Subaru's four-speed electronic automatic transmission. Both H6-3.0-powered Outback models feature specially designed alloy wheels, a mahogany wood and leather steering wheel, automatic climate control, an eight-way power driver's seat and a nifty rear-seat center armrest. All 2001-model-year Outback models benefit from a viscous limited-slip rear differential and larger front 11.4-inch ventilated disc brakes with twin piston calipers.  Standard interior features include an ambient temperature gauge, dual mode digital trip odometer and front seatback net pockets.Additionally, all Outbacks receive four-wheel disc brakes, ABS, protective lower body cladding, a heavy-duty four-wheel independent suspension, and 24-hour roadside assistance as standard equipment. Opt for the Outback wagon and you'll also get a 60/40-split folding rear seat, keyless entry, a 12-volt cargo area power outlet, a rear wiper/washer, and breakaway power side-view mirrors.     Safety is another area where Subaru refuses to skimp. The Outback models feature a ""Ring-Shaped Reinforcement"" body structure for maximum protection against frontal, offset, side and rear impacts. Side beams in both the front and rear doors further enhance side-impact protection.     We like the fact that Subaru offers a viable alternative to the SUV.

A five-speed manual transmission is optional on two-door models. More than a decade after launching the compact sport-utility blitz in 1982 with the S-10 Blazer, General Motors finally saw fit to totally redesign this veteran for the 1995 model year.  Still based on the S-10 chassis, but dropping the S-10 nomenclature, the 1995 Blazer was a vast improvement over its predecessor.Powered by a strong 4.3L V6 and offering several suspension choices, the Blazer can be tailored to specific needs: with either two-wheel or four-wheel drive, two doors or four.  The four-door is the most popular by far; the model of choice with families on the go.  There are accommodations for five, but four would most likely be more comfortable.  Lots of cargo space too, with the spare tire mounted underneath the cargo floor. Chevy claims that, with the rear seat folded, a washing machine box will fit into the cargo bay.  Not bad.  Sadly, the Blazer's interior is marred by acres of chintzy plastic and low-mounted rear seats offering little in the way of thigh support.  Adult rear seat riders will complain loudly.Off-road is not where the latest Blazer shines, unless equipped with the ZR2 off-road package.  Regular Blazers are capable enough for two-track dirt, but serious off-road adventures would be better handled by another make and model.  However, most families don't spend much, if any, time off-road in their sport utes, so this is not a large shortcoming.  As a road going hauler, the Blazer is quite capable.An all-wheel drive option was phased in during the 1995 model year, making the Blazer even more sure-footed.  Five new exterior and one new interior color debut for 1996.  The Vortec V6 has been improved, as have automatic transmissions.  Two-wheel drive models can be ordered with a five-speed manual transmission this year.  Daytime running lights are standard equipment, as well as a driver airbag and four-wheel antilock brakes.  A passenger airbag is not expected until 1998, and that's too bad.  The Blazer could certainly use one according to its crash test scores.The Blazer won North American Truck of the Year last January, as well as Motor Trend's Truck of the Year award, but the best thing about the new Blazer is its price.  With base models starting well under Jeep Grand Cherokee and less than the Ford Explorer, the Blazer represents real value.  However, poor crash test scores prevent us from recommending this Chevy.

New colors sum up the changes. Volkswagen's sedan version of the Golf, the Jetta, has always been one of our favorite sedans.  Like most cars conceived in Germany, the Jetta has an uncanny ability to keep the driver in touch with every undulation and irregularity in the road without sacrificing comfort.  It has a cavernous interior, logically laid-out controls and displays, and zippy performance.GL, GLS, Trek, and Wolfsburg Edition Jettas offer enough oomph to keep most drivers satisfied, when equipped with a five-speed transmission.  The optional automatic saps what little power the Jetta has to offer, and we don't recommend it.  Most drivers who want a Jetta will be of the persuasion that eschews the autobox in favor of rowing their own gears anyway because, let's face it, why buy a VW if you don't enjoy driving?Driving enjoyment is what the top-of-the-line GLX is all about.  Sporting a powerful and compact V6 engine, thick alloy wheels, and newly lowered sport suspension, the GLX is a poor man's BMW 325i.  If you have a need for speed, this is the Jetta to buy.This year, Jettas get a sharp new grille, smoother automatic transmission, and a new Bose stereo system is available.  Three new colors are available for 1996.  A Turbo Direct Injection (TDI) arrived in showrooms mid-year.  Volkswagen claims this car will change the way you think of diesels, touting how quick, quiet and clean it is.  We don't think Americans will be interested.Regular Jettas are a blast once they're moving.  Sharp steering response, a taut chassis, and a superb driving position combine to make you forget about the wimpy 2.0-liter, 115-horsepower engine under the hood.     Reliability has been a problem with Volkswagens in the past.  However, a new 10 year/100,000 mile warranty backs up the powertrain, and free roadside assistance is provided for the first two years of ownership.Not that you couldn't afford to fix it once in a while. The uplevel GLS, loaded with antilock brakes, sunroof, CD changer, and a fun-robbing automatic transmission, doesn't crack the $20,000 barrier.

The L stands for long wheelbase, and the distance between  the front and rear axles has been extended by 7 inches and the overall length  has grown a full foot from nose to tail. Most long-wheelbase versions of large  SUVs increase both passenger space and cargo capacity compared to the  standard-wheelbase versions. Instead, the Wagoneer L opts to keep the passenger  space the same and only enlarges the cargo area. 
We're  actually fine with the same-size passenger space since the smaller Wagoneer can  already comfortably accommodate adults in its third row. Compared to the  Wagoneer's 27.4 cubic foot cargo capacity, the Wagoneer L can hold upwards of  50% more with its 42.1 cubic feet. That likely means you can haul eight adults  and their luggage in a single trip.
As  much as we applaud the huge gain in cargo space, the Wagoneer L is somewhat  held back by its rough-riding standard suspension. It suffers with an bouncy  and unsettled feel, while handling is hampered by noticeable body roll when  cornering. We're partial to the air suspension that is noticeably more  comfortable and confident. Unfortunately, it's only available on the top Series  III trim that costs a lot more than the base model.
Among  other extended-wheelbase SUVs, the 2023 Jeep Wagoneer L holds a slight  advantage in cargo space as well as fuel economy and off-road capabilities.  That makes it a solid rival to the Chevrolet Suburban, the related GMC Yukon XL  and the Ford Expedition Max.  Higher  Wagoneer L trims tend to get rather expensive for what you're getting, which is  why we recommend the base Wagoneer L model. We'd also add the optional Convenience Group package to get several  safety and convenience features such as lane keeping assistance, adaptive  cruise control, heated second-row seats, a surround-view camera system and a  wireless charging pad.",Inline 6 cylinder ,190," 468 lb-ft @ 3,500 ",front wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic 
Honda,honda cr-v,2002,honda cr-v 2002,"['Highly versatile and roomy interior, stable handling, comfortable ride, high crash-test scores.']","['No V6 available, limited offroad ability.']",4.6,"Redesigned for 2002, Honda's CR-V boasts a number of improvements and refinements. Major changes include more power, more interior room and increased passenger protection. The longtime benchmark of the ""soft roader"" mini-SUV class, the CR-V is even better for 2002. Drive it. You'll like it. Consumers made the first-generation CR-V ('97-'01) one of the most popular and best-selling compact SUVs in the United States. Not wanting to lose those happy customers to newer competition in the mini-SUV market, Honda has improved the all-new CR-V in nearly every fashion. This includes more power, increased interior volume, the latest safety technology, elevated levels of comfort, and more utility and functionality without adding significant exterior size or compromise to the overall package.The main fault of the previous CR-V was its mediocre power output. To that end, the CR-V has a new 16-valve 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine under the hood. It produces 160  and 162 pound-feet of torque. The transmissions have also been updated. The four-speed automatic is an all-new design. In addition to improved smoothness and fuel efficiency, it features Grade Logic Control. Honda says this feature allows the transmission to downshift automatically and hold a lower gear when the CR-V is climbing a steep grade. For the five-speed manual, additional synchronizers and shorter throws make shifting easier and sportier.On-road comfort should continue to be a CR-V strength. The new CR-V is based on Honda's Global Compact Platform, the same one used for the Civic and RSX. It offers 50 percent more torsional rigidity and 30 percent improved bending rigidity compared to the '01 model, says Honda. This translates to better crash safety and ride quality. The new platform also produces less noise, vibration and harshness.The improved platform also allows for a larger interior without major increases in overall vehicle length. This translates to plenty of room for both people and cargo. The CR-V offers headroom, legroom and shoulder room for the driver and front passenger that is about equal to or better than the closest competitors'. The rear seat is separated near the middle, and each of the two sections will independently slide forward and backward for a total range of 6.7 inches, granting excellent legroom. Like the previous CR-V, the seatbacks can also recline independently.For 2002, the automatic transmission will be available on all three trim levels: two-wheel-drive LX, four-wheel-drive LX and four-wheel-drive EX. The manual transmission is offered only on four-wheel-drive vehicles. Both LX and EX come with a high level of standard equipment, such as air conditioning, power windows and locks, a one-touch up/down driver window, a CD player, rear-seat heater ducts and two 12-volt accessory outlets. In addition to this, the more upscale EX receives an upgraded audio system with a CD changer, keyless remote, a power moonroof and antilock brakes.Other safety features for the CR-V include dual pre-tensioners for the front seatbelts, headrests and three-point seatbelts for all five seating positions, dual-stage front airbags, optional side airbags (standard on EX) and whiplash-reducing front seats. In federal government crash testing, the CR-V has excelled, earning five stars (the best score possible) for both frontal and side impact tests. IIHS bumper-bash tests, however, have shown that the CR-V is susceptible to high repair costs for even minor collisions.Like the previous model, the 2002 CR-V is not meant to compete against hard-core recreational vehicles like the Jeep Liberty or Toyota 4Runner. Instead, it is meant for the person who wants the look and feel of a sport-utility without having to pay an exorbitant sticker price and huge gas bills. The CR-V will get people to work and back in all but the worst weather and to their favorite picnic area, assuming it's not on the Rubicon Trail.",Inline 4 cylinder ,276," 162 lb-ft @ 3,600 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Choices when it comes to full-size vans are easy to make. Do you want a Dodge, a Ford or one of the Chevy/GMC twins? If the Express offers the package you need in a full-size van, then buy it. When Chevy dealers received a brand-new, full-size van to sell in 1996, it marked the first time in 25 years that GM had completely redesigned its big vans. The Chevy Express Cargo comes standard with lots of space, dual airbags and four-wheel antilock brakes. And it can be equipped with a variety of powerful engines. With this modern design and body-on-frame construction, Chevrolet is stealing some of Ford's thunder in the full-size van market.Because most full-size vans are bought for conversion into rolling work stations, engineers decided to put the Chevy Express on a full-frame platform for improved stability. Regular-length models carry 267 cubic feet of cargo, and extended-length vans can haul 317 cubic feet of stuff. Trick rear doors open 180 degrees to make loading and unloading easier. For convenience, the full-size spare is stored underneath the cargo floor. A 31-gallon fuel tank keeps this thirsty vehicle from frequent fill-ups, but topping off an empty tank will quickly empty your wallet. Engine choices are sourced from the Chevrolet family of Vortec gasoline motors, or if you prefer, a turbocharged diesel. The Vortec 4300 V6 has been updated for 2000 to provide quieter operation, reduced emissions and improved durability. Other power plants include the 5000, 5700 and 7400 V8s, and a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8. Standard side cargo doors are a 60/40 panel arrangement, but a traditional slider is a no-cost option on 135-inch wheelbase vans.Only basic amenities are provided as standard on cargo models. These include full instrumentation, a single power outlet, an AM/FM stereo and ABS brakes. The optional equipment list includes all the usual upgrades that most passenger vans come with like front and rear air conditioning, a CD stereo and power door locks and mirrors. Exterior styling is an interesting mix of corporate Chevrolet, Astro Van and old Lumina Minivan. We'll admit the high, rear pillar-mounted taillights are odd-looking, but at least they're functional. They can easily be seen even if the van is operated with the rear doors open. Low-mounted bumpers and moldings make the Chevy Express look much taller than it is. An attractively sculpted body side gives the van's smooth, slab-sided flanks a dose of character, as does the quad-lamp grille arrangement.Overall, Chevrolet's latest rendition of the traditional full-size van appears to be right on target, giving Ford's Econoline its only real competition.",V6 cylinder ,200," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Gmc,gmc savana,2010,gmc savana 2010,"['Strong engines, dual passenger access doors, multiple wheelbase and passenger configurations, available all-wheel drive.']","['Cheap cabin plastics, less interior space than the Sprinter van, no tall-roof option.']",4.3,"For 2010, the GMC Savana 2500 and 3500 models receive a six-speed automatic transmission and revised rear axles for added low-end torque and improved highway fuel economy. Also new for this year are remote vehicle start and flex-fuel E85 compatibility. In addition, the base 5.3-liter engine receives a slight increase in horsepower. The 2010 GMC Savana is a willing workhorse for buyers requiring the functionality of a full-size van. As the GMC Savana enters its 14th year since its last redesign, the staid platform is beginning to show its age. Not so much for style and design, which are generally afterthoughts for such large utilitarian workhorses, but more in terms of available options, fuel economy and road manners. In these areas, recent full-size-van offerings from Ford and Dodge have outshined the aging Savana.Progress for the 2010 GMC Savana has been slow, but over the course of its history, it has seen numerous upgrades in terms of engines, available all-wheel drive, brakes, chassis and assorted interior improvements. This year, the Savana takes a few more baby steps forward with a new six-speed transmission, E85 flex-fuel compatibility and a slight bump in power for the 5.3-liter V8.What have managed to remain intact are the 2010 Savana's core strengths -- most notably, its voluminous interior that can accommodate up to 15 passengers. This makes it ideal for companies, churches and schools that need to transport plenty of passengers and cargo -- short of buying a bus. Unfortunately for the Savana, though, these strengths are also shared with its heady competition. The Ford E-Series is even longer in the tooth than the Savana but offers modern conveniences like navigation, satellite radio and a rearview camera. The Dodge Sprinter (soon to be sold under the Mercedes-Benz banner) exhibits better fuel economy and more refined driving dynamics and offers a tall-roof option. While the Dodge/Mercedes Sprinter has its advantages, the 2010 GMC Savana will cost a whopping $14,000 less, broadening its appeal to those on a tighter budget. The standard engine in Savana 1500 models is a 5.3-liter V8 making 310 horsepower and 344 pound-feet of torque. A 6.0-liter V8 rated at 323  and 373 lb-ft of torque is standard on 3500s. All 1500 models use a four-speed automatic that sends power to the rear wheels, while 2500s and 3500s get a heavy-duty six-speed transmission. An all-wheel-drive configuration is also available for the 1500. The maximum towing capacity on 1500 models is 6,300 pounds, while the heavy-duty 3500 can pull up to 7,600 pounds when properly equipped.Fuel economy is understandably poor for such large vehicles. The EPA estimates only 13 mpg city/17 mpg highway and 14 mpg in combined driving for the Savana 1500. Running on E85 will drop those figures by about 3 mpg across the board. All Savana models feature four-wheel antilock disc brakes, stability control and side curtain airbags (for the first three rows of seating). In government crash tests, the 2010 GMC Savana 1500 scored a perfect five-out-of-five stars for frontal impact protection of the driver and front passenger. A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2010 GMC Savana a respectable ride and decent handling characteristics. Either of the powerful V8 engines endows the big van with adequate merging and passing abilities, even when laden with passengers and cargo. Among full-size vans, the Savana is pleasant to drive but still can't match the European-style driving dynamics of the Sprinter. The GMC Savana's cabin is definitely geared for function over form. Controls are well placed and easily operated, but they'll never win an award for style. Because of the forward placement of the front seats, the front wheel humps intrude on the footwells, reducing space and comfort. Rear passengers fare better, with the optional 60/40-split driver-side doors making access to the rear seats much easier. The standard configuration seats 12, and depending on the model, eight- and 15-passenger layouts are also available. The standard-wheelbase (135-inch) 2010 GMC Savana full-size van comes in half-ton (1500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations. The extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available only on the 3500. There are two trim levels: LS and LT. LS models are geared toward fleet service, so standard equipment is limited to features such as air-conditioning, an AM/FM stereo, vinyl floor covering and a theft-deterrent system. The more livable LT models include a chrome grille, auxiliary rear air-conditioning and heating, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and keyless entry. Optional equipment includes power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, alloy wheels, remote vehicle start and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-CD changer.",V8 cylinder ,165," 334 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Work vehicle,  adventure rig, family hauler — you name it and the truck can do it.  Full-size vans, however, are starting to have their moment in the sun. The 2021  Ford Transit Cargo Van is a full-size van that offers multiple powertrains,  rear- or all-wheel-drive, a number of roof-height configurations and two  wheelbase lengths. Pair these versatile setups with a long list of available  options and upfitting possibilities, and you've got a commercial van that can  rival almost any pickup for usability.  
For  2021, Ford has eliminated the Transit's optional 2.0-liter diesel powertrain.  This might be a disappointment to some buyers, but we still think the standard  3.5-liter V6 and Ford's optional turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine are worthy  choices. Ford has also added a number of option packages to help preload the  Transit Cargo for specific purposes such as parcel delivery, RV conversion and  all-terrain adventures. 
Inside,  the Transit offers a likable interior, with a comfortable ride and an optional  8-inch touchscreen infotainment system. For on-road safety, there are a number  of driver assist aids such as forward collision warning and automatic emergency  braking, with optional parking sensors and adaptive cruise control.
Some of the Transit's rivals offer more upscale interiors or slightly higher  tow ratings, but that's not enough to steer us away. Overall, the Transit Cargo  is an ultra-versatile van that should easily impress most commercial and  recreational van shoppers.  Ford gives you lots of freedom to customize your particular van. The optional turbocharged engine and 8-inch Ford Sync touchscreen are worthy upgrades, but ultimately it all comes down to picking the best mix of features to match how you're going to use your Transit.",V6 cylinder ,165," 262 lb-ft @ 3,750 ",front wheel drive , 10-speed shiftable automatic

Speed-sensitive steering reduces effort at low speeds.  Chrome-plated wheels are a new option.  Remote keyless entry key fobs are redesigned, and automatic transmissions provide better fuel economy and smoother shifts. Believe it or not, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van lineup when the Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996.  The GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced in 1971, and sold steadily until recently.  Competition and safety regulations forced GM to redo the big vans -- heck, since 1971 Ford had re-engineered the Club Wagon and Econoline twice!  To distinguish the new design, GMC rebadged the van Savana.Savana features flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard antilock brakes and dual airbags.  Doors contain side impact guard beams, though they do not meet 1999 safety standards yet.  Front foot and legroom is adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of fore and aft travel.  Rear heat ducts are standard, but for better warming (and cooling) an optional rear heating and air conditioning unit is available.  Front air conditioning is standard.  The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet, and storage for items like CDs and cassettes.  Five sound systems are offered.

Competent on road and off, the Grand Cherokee has everything going for it: comfort, performance, looks...but not an untarnished reliability record. The designers of the Jeep Grand Cherokee are taking some much needed RandR following last year's introduction of the second-generation Grand, so there have been no significant mechanical or appearance changes. It was the first redesign since its 1992 introduction (as a '93 model), and the public basically gained an all-new best-of-the-best Jeep. Signature items like the vertical slot grille and trapezoidal wheel openings remained but were altered just enough to distance it from the previous generation. It was also made 4 inches longer and outfitted with redesigned recirculating-ball steering, a fresh three-link rear suspension, and front Quadra Link coil suspension that make it stable and carlike, and handle like a pro.  Another notable improvement was the new automatic transmission, which increases initial acceleration and provides smoother shifting between gears.The Grand's standard engine is a 4.0-liter inline six, and the next step up is the optional 4.7-liter V8. In fact, this potent power-maker has been such a hit that Chrysler is morphing from it a version for the 2000 Durango and Dakota. You'll find cloth surroundings standard inside the Laredo, while the Limited lets you slide behind the wheel in leather-trimmed comfort (optional on the Laredo); the leather front seats feature 10-way power-seating choices, but you'll likely find your comfort level short of that.

The Laredo's standard transfer case is the full-time Selec-Trac, while the Limited's is the on-demand Quadra-Trac II. While going off-road may not be something you've considered doing with your just-purchased luxury vehicle, remember that this is a Jeep, the original 4x4, and it hasn't lost any of its go-anywhere war heritage.

But when it comes to maximum versatility and ease of use, you can't beat the ultimate box on wheels. The Toyota Sienna (looking more like a jelly bean, actually) is six model years old and doesn't offer as much utility and functionality as newer competitors, such as the Honda Odyssey or the Kia Sedona. But it's still one of the top choices in the minivan class. With the Sienna, Toyota has placed an emphasis on safety, quality and performance. Furthermore, this minivan has an excellent reputation for reliability, strong predicted resale value and a smooth powertrain. Under the hood is a smooth, powerful and refined 3.0-liter V6 mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. This same powertrain setup can also be found in the Toyota Camry. In the Sienna, the engine produces 210 horsepower and 220 pound-feet of torque. The Sienna's rigid and lightweight unitized body has performed exceptionally well in government crash tests. Standard safety features include ABS, front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters, a low tire-pressure warning system and daytime running lights. Every Sienna can also be ordered with optional side airbags and a stability control system that helps prevent dangerous skids and spins. The Sienna driving experience is similar to the Camry in that it's pleasantly nonconfrontational. Steering is sure, if not quite nimble. The suspension does a good job of soaking up road imperfections, and wind noise is kept to a minimum. Braking is exceptionally competent. Acceleration from the V6 is more than acceptable for almost all situations, and the cabin is quiet at highway speeds. Overall, Toyota does not make the biggest or most useful minivan, but it does make a reliable, safe, solidly performing and refined alternative to a number of family haulers on the market. The Sienna was designed to offer optimum interior roominess in a compact, easy-to-maneuver package. The interior has a definite Camry feel to it, and is constructed and trimmed in high-quality materials. Removable modular seating allows for custom configurations to accommodate a variety of cargo requirements. A second-row bench seat or captain's chairs and third-row seats can be folded or removed to accommodate bulkier cargo.

It's not especially quiet or comfortable,  but it's a reasonably priced performance car you can drive daily.  You might  reasonably expect some rough edges in a car born of Subaru's decades-long  participation in rally racing, a form of motorsport largely run in dirt, mud  and gravel. But the real surprise is just how domesticated these cars really  are. The WRX and even-faster WRX STI are powered by turbocharged four-cylinder  engines optimized for performance but capable of decent fuel economy. The WRX  delivers 268 horsepower and an EPA-estimated 23 mpg combined with the manual  transmission, while the STI wrings out 305  and 19 mpg combined. The WRX  also offers a good serving of modern tech and convenience, either as standard  equipment or options, including a choice of two multimedia systems, two audio  systems, smartphone app integration, navigation, and driver aids such as blind-spot monitoring, lane departure warning, and automatic emergency  braking. These attributes, plus comfortable seating, a roomy cabin and  excellent visibility, make the WRX a legitimately practical daily driver and  family car. But  there's no denying that the WRX can be a loud and raucous car. You'll hear  plenty of road noise and feel plenty of road surface inside the cabin,  especially in the STI, which can drive from dealer lot to weekend rally race  and be instantly competitive. Key rivals such as the Volkswagen GTI and Ford  Focus ST far surpass the Subaru for daily civility. To be fair, Subaru says it  has made efforts to quiet the 2018 model with thicker glass, seals and  insulation.

The 2018 Subaru WRX is among the swiftest and best-handling compact cars around. It's not especially quiet or comfortable, but it's a reasonably priced performance car you can drive daily. Each vehicle typically comes in  multiple versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this  review are based on our full test of the 2015  Subaru WRX (turbo 2.0L inline-4 | 6-speed manual | AWD) A deluge of midrange power makes it easy to keep the 2.0-liter turbo engine in its sweet spot. The 0-60-mph time of 5.4 seconds is a second quicker than most rivals but requires a violent, high-rev launch technique. The WRX stopped from 60 mph in 110 feet, typical for a sport compact with performance tires. The brakes show good resistance to fade, but pedal response is unremarkable. The steering feels direct with lots of feedback, one of the better electric-assist systems out there. Midcorner response and feel are especially impressive. Not hyper or fidgety on the highway. Grip is truly impressive (0.94g on the skidpad), allowing for a rapid pace on our mountain road test route. All-wheel drive keeps the car planted no matter how hard you push. The heavy clutch becomes tiresome in traffic, and the engagement point can be tricky. The throttle causes jerkiness in certain situations. Not the easiest car to drive smoothly when equipped the manual transmission. We didn't take the WRX off-road for testing, but its sophisticated all-wheel-drive system has years of rally racing technology behind it. Not tall enough for Jeep-like moves, but more than capable in dirt and mud. Supportive seats offer consistent comfort during a full day of driving. The eight-way power driver's seat adjusts broadly and is friendly for tall and short folks alike. Lacks lumbar adjustment. Drivers unaccustomed to sporty cars will find the WRX stiff, but it's actually well-damped and comfortable for its class, and good enough to mask the incessant bobbing of choppy L.A. highways. This car is louder than average on the inside with an abundance of road and wind noise. After a day behind the wheel, our ears were getting tired. Even worse, the weak base stereo can't compensate. The climate control system couldn't be simpler. The radio faceplate is easy to use, but the display is too small for iPod or satellite radio readout. You must use the redundant audio screen in the dashtop trip computer. A tall roofline and sporty seats with slim side bolsters make it relatively easy to get in and out, despite the WRX's sports car nature. Same goes for the backseat. A 6-foot-tall rear passenger can sit behind a 6-foot driver. The driver's seat offers more adjustment, and therefore room, than expected of a compact car. Headroom may be tight for those with long torsos. The low dash and hood create an expansive view of the road reminiscent of Japanese cars from decades past. The tall windows and huge mirrors further benefit visibility. The rearview camera is standard but tiny. Approaches level of the VW GTI and Ford Focus ST (although still falls short). Soft-touch materials, no flimsy bits and the switchgear feels nice to use. Rivals cost less and give you more, but if you prioritize performance over equipment, the WRX represents excellent value. Modestly sized glovebox and armrest compartment, but usefully sized cupholders and center stack bin. The 12-cubic-foot trunk has a large opening and the rear seat is a 60/40-split folding arrangement. Useful for packing tools and toys for other outdoor/lifestyle pursuits. Base infotainment includes a 6.2-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth and CD player. Top-level system comes with 7-inch touchscreen, navigation and more. New Multimedia Plus system sits in between — 7-inch screen, voice commands, Siri Eyes Free — and comes standard on Premium and above. No Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, but Pandora and Aha music app streaming comes standard on base models. Siri Eyes Free and MirrorLink (a universal smartphone interface) are standard on the Premium trim and above. Blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert are bundled together, while more robust features such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning and automatic emergency braking are available in the optional EyeSight package. New Multimedia Plus infotainment includes voice commands, including hands-free text messaging feature, and Siri Eyes Free. The top-level system offers the same, with voice commands also available for navigation functions. With its 305- engine and sport everything — brakes, suspension, seats, steering — we would love to recommend the WRX STI, but we can't. Out of the box, it's a competitive weekend race car that you can drive to work during the week, but its high-strung manner and unforgiving suspension limit its appeal. Instead, we'd steer you to a WRX Limited. While the Premium trim costs less, moving up to the Limited beings a 10-way power-adjustable driver seat, adaptive LED headlights, keyless entry and ignition, as well as a range of options, including navigation and various driver safety features. Base WRX models start with a 2.0-liter  turbocharged four-cylinder engine (268 , 258 pound-feet of torque), a  six-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive. The standard equipment list  also includes 17-inch wheels, performance tires, heated side mirrors, cloth  upholstery, a rearview camera, 60/40-split folding rear seats, Bluetooth phone  and audio connection, and a six-speaker media system with a 6.2-inch touchscreen,  satellite and HD radio, CD player, USB and auxiliary inputs, and smartphone app  integration. The WRX Premium adds 18-inch wheels, foglights,  a sunroof, heated front seats, windshield wiper de-icers, and a 7-inch  touchscreen. The Limited builds on that with LED  headlights and foglights, automatic high beams, a 10-way power-adjustable  driver seat, leather-trimmed upholstery, keyless ignition and entry, and an  optional continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) with paddle  shifters. Options  for WRX Premium models with manual transmission include the 7-inch touchscreen,  an upgraded Harman Kardon audio system, and a new Performance package that  bundles Recaro front seats (including an eight-way power-adjustable driver  seat), upgraded brake pads, and red-painted brake calipers. This package  deletes the sunroof, however, in the interests of weight savings. A  manual-equipped WRX Limited is eligible for options including navigation,  upgraded audio, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems,  while Limited models equipped with the CVT can add Subaru's EyeSight system,  which bundles features such as adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency  braking, lane departure warning, automatic high beams, and adaptive  (""bending"") foglights that help illuminate corners and curves. The  EyeSight system is not available with the stick shift, though. STI models come equipped like the WRX  Premium but with a bigger engine, 19-inch wheels, and no sunroof. The base STI  adds a more powerful 2.5-liter engine engine (305 , 290 lb-ft), Brembo  brakes, front and rear limited-slip differentials, and more aggressive  suspension tuning. Options include Recaro sport seats, an eight-way  power-adjustable driver seat, and keyless ignition and entry.The STI Limited adds back the sunroof plus  keyless ignition and entry, an eight-way power driver seat, blind-spot  monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert and the premium audio system with  navigation. The lone option is a low-profile trunk lip spoiler. EyeSight is not  offered for the WRX STI. Several  dealer-installed options are available for the WRX and STI, including a performance  exhaust (base WRX), an auto-dimming rearview mirror, short-throw shifter,  carbon-fiber trim, unique shift knobs and interior lighting accents.

A new rear defogger (on models with fixed rear glass) improves visibility in inclement weather. Choices when it comes to full-size vans are easy to make. Do you want a Dodge, a Ford or one of the Chevy/GMC twins? If the Express offers the package you need in a full-size van, then buy it. When Chevy dealers received a brand-new, full-size van to sell in 1996, it marked the first time in 25 years that GM had completely redesigned its big vans. The Chevy Express comes standard with lots of cargo space, dual airbags and four-wheel antilock brakes. And it can be equipped with a variety of powerful engines. With this modern design and body-on-frame construction, Chevrolet is stealing some of Ford's thunder in the full-size van market.Because most full-size vans are bought for conversion into rolling motel rooms, engineers decided to put the Chevy Express on a full-frame platform for improved stability. Regular-length models carry 267 cubic feet of cargo, and extended-length vans can haul 317 cubic feet of stuff. Trick rear doors open 180 degrees to make loading and unloading easier. Up to 15 passengers can ride in the extended-length version, making it perfect for use as an airport shuttle. Other seating options include five-, eight- and 12-passenger arrangements. And G3500s can tow up to 10,000 pounds when properly equipped.For convenience, the full-size spare is stored underneath the cargo floor. A 31-gallon fuel tank keeps this thirsty vehicle from frequent fill-ups, but topping off an empty tank will quickly empty your wallet.  Engine choices are sourced from the Chevrolet family of Vortec gasoline motors, or if you prefer, a turbocharged diesel. The Vortec 4300 V6 has been updated for 2000 to provide quieter operation, reduced emissions and improved durability.  Other powerplants include the 5000, 5700, and 7400 V8s, and a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8. Standard side cargo doors are a 60/40 panel arrangement, but a traditional slider is a no-cost option on 135-inch wheelbase vans.Two trim levels are available: base and LS. Child safety locks are standard on the rear and side doors. Handy assist handles help folks climb in and out. Base Express vans include front air conditioning (front and rear air conditioning is optional), vinyl seats, AM/FM stereo, and daytime running lights.  LS adds power windows and locks, cruise control and tilt wheel.Exterior styling is an interesting mix of corporate Chevrolet, Astro Van and old Lumina Minivan. We'll admit the high, rear pillar-mounted taillights are odd looking, but at least they're functional.  They can easily be seen even if the van is operated with the rear doors open. Low-mounted bumpers and moldings make the Chevy Express look much taller than it is. An attractively sculpted body side gives the van's smooth, slab-sided flanks a dose of character, as does the quad-lamp grille arrangement. For 2000, new exterior colors and side striping debut, as a new rear defogger is available for models with fixed or vented rear glass.Overall, Chevrolet's latest rendition of the traditional full-size van appears to be right on target, giving Ford's Econoline/Club Wagon its only real competition.",V8 cylinder ,130," 330 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Gmc,gmc terrain,2010,gmc terrain 2010,"['Quiet and attractive cabin, good ride/handling balance, roomy accommodations, impressive fuel economy.']","['Cargo space could be more generous, bigger wheels hurt ride quality.']",4.2,"The 2010 GMC Terrain is an all-new small crossover SUV. The 2010 GMC Terrain is an eye-catching and capable crossover SUV that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as segment stars like the RAV4 and CR-V. On the one hand, the 2010 GMC Terrain is an old-school GM badge job, an unabashed Chevrolet Equinox knockoff with the same platform, features and powertrains. But unlike many old-school GM badge jobs, this one is fundamentally a really good vehicle, so we're willing to cut it some slack. Indeed, the Terrain and its Equinox sibling look set to shake up the small-to-midsize crossover SUV segment that Honda and Toyota have long dominated.The 2010 Terrain benefits from the same updates as this year's redesigned Equinox. Under the hood is a torquey base four-cylinder that offers best-in-class fuel economy and competitive acceleration. There's also an available direct-injected 3.0-liter V6 that's similarly competitive in terms of fuel economy and power. Inside, the Terrain boasts a snazzy center stack and attractive control layout that make its rivals' cabins seem dull and unimaginative by comparison. An abundance of acoustic insulation and an innovative noise-canceling system also make the Terrain one of the quietest compact crossovers around.The Terrain isn't quite fault-free. Its maximum cargo capacity, for instance, isn't as generous as that of some competing models. But otherwise it's pretty hard to find fault with GMC's new SUV. The 2010 GMC Terrain offers just about everything that shoppers in this segment are looking for, and it's one you'll definitely want to cross-shop along with established models like the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V, Mitsubishi Outlander, Nissan Rogue and Toyota RAV4. Every GMC Terrain comes standard with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine producing 182 horsepower and 172 pound-feet of torque. Optional on all but the SLE-1 is a 3.0-liter V6 good for 264  and 222 lb-ft of torque. Both engines come standard with a six-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel-drive; all-wheel drive is optional across the board.Fuel economy is impressive. A four-cylinder Terrain with front-wheel drive achieves an EPA-estimated 22 mpg city/32 mpg highway and 26 mpg combined. All-wheel drive lowers these estimates to 20/29/23 mpg. A Terrain V6 with front-wheel drive gets 17 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 20 mpg combined, with all-wheel-drive versions dropping only incrementally to 17/24/20. The maximum tow rating when properly equipped is 3,500 pounds with the V6. The 2010 GMC Terrain comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability control, front seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and OnStar. Rear parking sensors are optional. The 2010 GMC Terrain accelerates well with the new four-cylinder engine, and its 32-mpg highway rating with this engine is most impressive. This engine should satisfy most folks, but for those wanting more there's the optional V6. The optional mill is a bit short on low-end torque relative to the RAV4's standard-setting V6, but otherwise it's one of the strongest engine choices you'll find in this segment. On the move, the new Terrain is impressively quiet, and the ride is comfortable. However, we'd suggest sticking with the smallest possible wheels, as the larger ones increase impact harshness. Handling capabilities are nothing special, but most drivers should be satisfied by the vehicle's all-around competence.
Read our GMC Terrain Long-Term 20,000-Mile Test The GMC Terrain's cabin is remarkably stylish, particularly by the standards of this typically utilitarian segment. The slick-looking dashboard design is reminiscent of the related Cadillac SRX, and the Terrain's high-tech navigation and entertainment options only heighten its appeal.In terms of accommodations, the Terrain's backseat is roomy for this class and conveniently reclines and slides fore and aft (to allow easier access to child seats or to expand cargo capacity). Cargo space behind the backseat is 31.4 cubic feet, and that figure grows to 63.7 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. That's about 6 cubes shy of the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, but still bigger than smaller crossovers like the Ford Escape and Nissan Rogue. The SLT-1 has the aforementioned plus 18-inch alloy wheels, remote engine start, leather upholstery and heated front seats. The SLT-2 ups the ante with chrome exterior trim details, a unique grille, driver memory functions, a sunroof, a power liftgate and rear parking sensors. Additional options, depending on the trim level, include a hard-drive-based navigation system (with larger rearview camera display and 40GB of music storage) and a rear-seat entertainment system.

If  you're Lexus, you answer that question with: ""Add a third-row seat.""  The 450hL has the same hybrid powertrain and features as a standard RX. The  extra length from front to back allows for a third row and seating for up to  seven people. Just be aware that the RX's third row is one of the smallest in  the class. It does offer a bit of added versatility, but it's really only meant  for small children.  A  few changes this year enhance the RX 450hL's desirability. Up front, the 2020  RX 450hL gets restyled headlights and a new bumper for a more sophisticated  look. Lexus also tweaked the suspension to bring about slight improvements in  handling stability and ride comfort. Inside, there's a new infotainment  interface plus touchscreen functionality. The new trackpad interface is better  than last year's mouse-like controller, but it can still be overly distracting  to use when driving. Finally, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also on board  this year as standard equipment.  Deciding  on whether the RX 450hL is for you largely comes down to your priorities. This  Lexus is a niche SUV that offers high fuel economy and a third-row seat that  might come in handy a couple of times a year. But other RX variants, whether  the regular RX 350 or the RX 450h, are more broadly appealing because of their  more affordable pricing. And if you need a dedicated family taxi, a roomier SUV  such as the Acura MDX Sport Hybrid or new Lincoln Aviator would likely be a  better choice. The  RX 450hL comes in two trim levels: the base model and the Luxury (which can  also be considered a package). Both are essentially available with the same  wide array of options, so we'd opt for the base model and opt for the Navigation package with the 15-speaker  Mark Levinson audio system. It adds a beautiful, large display screen with  onboard navigation and an outstanding sound system. The 450hL's thick rear roof  pillars reduce visibility, so the optional blind-spot monitor and surround-view  parking camera system are smart investments.",V6 cylinder ,205," 247 lb-ft @ 4,600 ",front wheel drive , Continuously variable-speed automatic

This luxury crossover is  loaded with features, costs thousands of dollars less than competitors, and is  spacious for passengers and cargo alike. And while rivals generally stick to a conservatively  upscale interior design, the QX50 bucks convention, offering an inspired cabin  that looks like nothing else on the market. We're genuinely impressed that the  corporate bigwigs rubber-stamped the contrasting-color surfaces and suede-like  trim.  
But  some of the QX50's avant-garde touches threaten to mar the experience. The most  egregious offender is the so-called VC-Turbo engine and its transmission. The  variable-compression engine was created to reap the benefits of running on both  low and high compression, which should theoretically deliver either excellent  performance or superb fuel economy on demand. But in real life, the turbo-four  delivers only so-so acceleration numbers and mediocre fuel economy. The kicker  is that the engine is also very sensitive to throttle inputs — an  inadvertent press of your big toe will deliver immediate thrust even if you  didn't intend it.
If  you're looking for a value-rich compact SUV, the Acura RDX and Volvo XC60 are  appealing alternatives that won't strain your pocketbook. And while they aren't  the least expensive options around, the Audi Q5 and Mercedes-Benz GLC come with  a lot of features right out of the box. None of these alternatives exhibit  anything like the QX50's powertrain quirks.

We cover everything from comfort to performance. Style and  technology were among the highlights, but we took issue with elements of its  performance. Note that for the 2020 model year, the QX50 got a new infotainment system with  smartphone integration as well as some new safety features that weren't  available on our 2019 long-term test vehicle. A  major component of the QX50's appeal is the budget-friendly price tag. We say  keep the costs under control and get this small crossover in one of its lower  trims.

Competitors might deliver unmistakable value, compelling  style, next-generation tech, genuine off-road ability or class-leading ride  comfort.  
The  Chevrolet Equinox offered few of these standout attributes to begin with, and  with the cancellation of its powerful turbocharged 2.0-liter engine option,  this year's model feels like a C-student wallflower among numerous impressive  alternatives. Though the Equinox exhibits good ride comfort and has a nifty  infotainment system, its drab interior, wallowy handling and tepid acceleration  are decidedly unimpressive. The same goes for Chevrolet's nickel-and-dime  approach to features.
The  2021 Chevrolet Equinox was supposed to be a refreshed model, but COVID-related  delays pushed the update to next year. Our advice? If you need a compact SUV  now, take a look at one of the Equinox's many superior rivals, such as the  Honda CR-V, Mazda CX-5 or Ford Escape. If you absolutely need a bowtie in your  driveway, wait until the restyled 2022 Equinox debuts in the first half of  2021.

It's also the last traditional sedan in Chevy's lineup that is dominated by  SUVs and trucks.

Otherwise, the Malibu returns with its weak base engine and dated  interior.
While  we credit the Malibu's spacious interior and accommodating trunk as some of its  best attributes, it falls well short of the mark set by the Kia K5 and Hyundai  Sonata. More importantly, there's a new Honda Accord on the way, which has the  potential to claim class-leading status.

If bang-for-the-buck is your priority, look no further than the awesome 2002 Z06. Nearly 45 years after the 1953 Corvette debuted, Chevrolet introduced the fifth-generation Corvette for 1997. Since then, it has gained a reputation as one of the premier sports cars in the world. Much of that reputation stems from the standard LS1 V8 under the hood. Rated at 350 horsepower and 360 pound-feet of torque (375 lb-ft with the manual transmission), this engine unleashes effortless power at any speed. Equipped with the standard four-speed automatic transmission, the Corvette will hit 60 mph in a shade over 5 seconds. Opt for the six-speed manual transmission, and you'll cut almost half a second off the trap time. To help rein the power in on slippery surfaces, acceleration slip regulation (traction control) is standard equipment. Last year saw the introduction of the ultra-high performance Z06 model. With 385 , race caliber brakes, and a lightweight chassis, it was one of the fastest, lightest and stiffest Corvettes ever to leave the factory. This year, the Z06 roars with 405 horsepower and 400 lb-ft of torque from its LS6 V8 in addition to a retuned suspension and a standard head-up display. With that kind of power on hand, expect 0-to-60 times in as little as 4 seconds and quarter-mile passes finished off in 12.5 seconds. Manhole cover-sized four-wheel-disc antilock brakes keep stopping distances short, while massive 17-inch front and 18-inch rear tires contribute to prodigious amounts of road grip. Standard  on all Corvettes is a second-generation Active Handling System (AHS), which keeps the Corvette in line even if the driver isn't. Inside, large analog gauges and well-placed radio and climate controls greet passengers. Luggage space beneath the coupe's rear hatch glass is a healthy 25 cubic feet, more cargo room than any Corvette in history and more than most sedans. Yes, the Corvette is an outstanding sports car and competes favorably with the best in the world. With more than 400 horsepower, the 2002 Z06 lands the Corvette in some very exclusive territory populated by the likes of Ferrari, Porsche and Lamborghini -- not bad considering that it sells for less than $50K.  Don't let the fact that the C5 will swallow two golf bags sway you into thinking this is a gentrified sporting coupe. The 2002 Corvette is one of the best true sports cars you can buy at any price point. Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines.

Unfortunately, when  you compare it to passenger van rivals, it's clear that the Express has fallen  desperately behind the times. The Express (also known as the Express Passenger)  uses body-on-frame construction, much like a modern pickup truck, which helps  it provide tow ratings as high as 9,600 pounds. Unfortunately, this  body-on-frame design also means that the Express has an uncomfortable ride,  both on the highway and in the city.

The LT comes with a number of  driver aids such as forward collision alert and lane departure warning, as well  as some convenience features including keyless entry and interior carpeting.

Gmc,gmc savana,2002,gmc savana 2002,"['Powerful V8 engine choices, cavernous interior.']","['Spotty build quality, cheap interior materials.']",4.2,"GMC's full-size van gets only minor improvements, such as a more efficient starter and a stronger steering gear housing. Models with an 8,600-pound or above GVWR and either the 8100 V8 or 6.5-liter diesel engine are newly certified as low emissions vehicles in California. How do you choose between a Chevrolet or a GMC full-size van? Which dealer is closest to your house? They're basically the same vehicle. And these GM vans stack up well against the formidable Ford Econoline and ancient has-been Dodge Ram Van. As long as the Savana provides what you need in this kind of vehicle, it's tough to go wrong here. When the then-new Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van. The old GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced way back in 1971 (when vans were still groovy), and sold steadily until they were finally discontinued. Competition and safety regulations had forced GM to redo the big vans for '96, but by then Ford had already re-engineered its Econoline twice! To help distinguish GM's all-new, rounded-off design, GMC rebadged its new van Savana. Savanas are available in 135- and 155-inch wheelbases and three weight series (1500, 2500 or 3500). They feature seating for eight, 12 or 15 people, depending on wheelbase, and are available in three different trim levels (base SL, uplevel SLE and luxury SLT). There's even a choice of side-entry doors: a slider or a set of 60/40 hinged doors. GM's full-size vans feature flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard four-wheel antilock brakes and dual airbags. Front foot- and legroom is adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of travel. Front air conditioning and rear heat ducts are standard. The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet and storage for items like CDs and cassettes. Inside the short-wheelbase Savana, you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the extended version provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume with the rear seats removed. Rear hinged doors open a full 180 degrees for easy loading and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened. For hauling, gross vehicle weight ratings of up to 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase. The base engine is a 200-horsepower Vortec 4300 V6. Optional motors include a 220-horse Vortec 5000 V8, the venerable 255-horse Vortec 5700 V8 and GM's Vortec 8100 big block V8 that makes 340 ponies and a whopping 455 pound-feet of torque. Also available is a robust 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 good for 195 horsepower and 430 lb-ft of torque. Savana 1500s use GM's 4L60 four-speed transmission while all 2500s and 3500s use the heavier-duty 4L80-E.Savana's styling is rounded and bulbous, with a broad front end that mimics GM's truck family and a high-arched rear with tall, thin taillights mounted up along the D-pillars. The round-topped rear end and sheer size of this van make it seem as if you are looking at the back end of some sort of commuter train car. But since most retail buyers have moved to minivans and much of the full-size van business has centered on converters and fleet use, Savana's styling takes a back seat to its modern mechanicals and long service life.",V6 cylinder ,300," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Gmc,gmc hummer-ev,2022,gmc hummer-ev 2022,,"['More expensive than non-electric off-roaders', 'Small cargo bed limits utility', ""Probably won't win any EV efficiency awards""]",,"GMC's  2022 Hummer EV is the brand's all-electric take on the wildly capable luxury  pickup. You might even call it a supertruck. It's got 1,000 horsepower,  torque-vectoring four-wheel drive with locking differentials, and four-wheel  steering. It combines seemingly everything the GM engineers could come up with  to make it crazy quick, on- and off-road capable, and well finished throughout.  Plus, it's available with the latest driver's aids designed to make it safer,  easier and more fun to drive. 
To  demonstrate the lengths GMC has gone to make the Hummer EV unique and  extravagant, consider the following: It comes with 35-inch tires, can tow 7,500  pounds, and can be had with up to nine cameras in every conceivable location,  including underneath. Its roof panels can be removed. It has launch control and  it can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in about 3.0 seconds. And there are more  high-definition screens inside than you'll find at a modest Super Bowl party. 
The  penalty for all this extravagance, of course, is weight and cost. At about  9,000 pounds the Hummer EV is enormously heavy. However, if you don't plan to  drive mountain roads every day that may matter little. But you'll not escape  the Edition 1 trim's six-figure starting price or its voracious appetite for  electrons.
Though  there aren't any competitors that align perfectly with the Hummer EV and its  many talents, the Rivian R1T may come the closest. The Rivian is smaller,  lighter, and less outlandish than the Hummer, but it offers many of the same  qualities. It's also outlandishly powerful and offers qualities such as  adjustable ride height, clever utility and plenty of tech. And it starts at a  lower asking price than the Hummer. Other competitors include the far more  subtle and reasonable Ford F-150 Lightning as well as the traditional  gas-powered F-150 Raptor and Ram 1500 TRX.  The  2022 GMC Hummer EV Edition 1 comes nearly fully loaded. Other than deciding  whether to get any of the truck's small collection of options, your hardest  decision will likely be what color to get.",,215,,front wheel drive , 1-speed direct drive 
Subaru,subaru forester,2001,subaru forester 2001,"['SUV style, car-like ride and handling, functional interior.']","['Limited rear-seat room, not a true off-roader.']",4.1,"The 2001 Forester receives slight alterations to the front and rear fascias, a new Premium Package, and upgrades to the interior. An enjoyable vehicle that can't quite match the versatility of other mini SUVs. What do you do when sport-utility buyers won't drive home in your all-wheel-drive station wagon, which is dressed up like an SUV, because it looks too ""wagony""? If you're gutsy like Subaru, you put a taller, more squared-off body on your wagon chassis, and call it good. The Forester is a Subaru parts-bin exercise, and since the parts bin is rather small at Fuji Heavy Industries, which owns the upstart all-wheel-drive automaker, the car is cobbled together from a mixture of Impreza and previous-generation Legacy bits. Based on the rally-proven Impreza platform, the Forester uses the same popular all-wheel-drive system found in other Subaru models. The 2.5-liter boxer engine comes from the Legacy Outback, and makes 165 horsepower in the Forester. And, thanks to its hunkered-down stance, low center of gravity and car-based foundation, the Forester handles better than its primary competitors: the Chevrolet Tracker, Honda CR-V, Nissan Xterra, Suzuki Grand Vitara and Toyota RAV4. The trade-off is lower ground clearance and less capable off-road ability, but you weren't going to go too far off the beaten path anyway, were you? (Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.) Automatic transmissions are available on both models for an extra $800 and feature a hill-holding setup that detects the inclination of a road surface and holds a gear to maximize torque or provide engine braking. Inside is room for four adults, with a rear center position marked off for a fifth rider in a pinch - he even gets a headrest for the new year! Though the Forester offers an accommodating rear seat, low step-in height, and a cavernous cargo area, the interior fabric looks and feels like terrycloth stretched over old cardboard, some secondary controls are placed illogically, and the stereo controls are difficult to operate. Two Forester models are available this year: the L and the high-end S. Air conditioning, roof rack, rear defogger, tachometer, power windows, tilt steering, rear wiper/washer, cassette stereo, antilock brakes, power door locks and cruise control are standard on the L. Included for the 2001 year are an in-glass antenna and 60/40 split fold-down rear seats. The uplevel S adds a toothy chrome grille, alloy wheels, bigger tires, rear disc brakes, and an in-dash 6-disc CD changer. You can opt for the Premium Package on the S which will get you gold accents on the wheels, side air bags and a huge power moonroof. While we are partial to the Impreza Outback Sport and Legacy Outback models, the Forester will attract buyers who want an inexpensive, functional, all-wheel-drive vehicle that looks like a truck and drives like a car.

The Excel is long dead, and it's time to stop thinking of Hyundai as a second-rate automobile manufacturer.  Several years ago, the Accent and Sonata provided a strong hint that this South Korean automaker was finally learning how to build a good car.  This Elantra provides the proof.  Larger and more powerful than the first-generation Elantra, this car offers quite a bit of bang for your buck in either sedan or wagon bodystyles.Under the hood is a 130-horsepower 1.8-liter Hyundai-designed Beta engine, which produces 90 percent  of its torque at 2,300 rpm, resulting in snappy around town performance.  Riding on a four-wheel independent suspension, the Elantra features a longer wheelbase and wider track than the original model, which contributes to smoother, more stable handling.  A speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system communicates improved road feel to the driver.  GLS models can be ordered with four-channel antilock brakes, which read each wheel separately.Dual airbags are standard on the Elantra, housed in a two-piece dashboard designed to reduce squeaks and rattles.  Adjustable headrests and seatbelt anchors are standard, and all models come with driver's side lumbar support and seat height adjustments.  GLS models get a 60/40 split folding rear seat. Extensive use of sound deadening materials helps quiet this compact car.Base price for a five-speed sedan is $11,499.  This price includes five-mph bumpers, rear window defroster, dual remote control mirrors, rear seat heat ducts, remote fuel and trunk releases, tilt steering and speed-sensitive steering.  Another $2,100 nets buyers a GLS model with a cassette stereo, power door locks, power outside mirrors, six-way adjustable driver's seat, split fold rear seat, power windows, four-wheel disc brakes and performance-oriented tires.  Option Packages can add air conditioning, cruise control, and antilock brakes for less than $1,600.Good value?  Let's take a look.  A Civic LX sedan equipped with air conditioning, automatic, and antilock brakes runs about $16,500.  A similarly equipped Dodge Neon Highline comes in around $15,000, including ABS.  A sporty Pontiac Sunfire SE sedan with a powerful 2.4-liter engine stickers near $16,000 and includes traction control.  A fully loaded Kia Sephia GS will cost $13,500.The Hyundai Elantra is much improved over its predecessor.  But like other Hyundai products, once a few options are added, the value disappears.  The Pontiac offers superior content, the Dodge superior performance, the Honda a better reputation, and the Kia better value.  If Hyundai had priced the Elantra a bit more down market, it would make a compelling choice.  We like this Hyundai, but as it stands, the Elantra is likely to be passed over by most consumers, simply because of the nomenclature affixed to the decklid.",Inline 4 cylinder ,165," 122 lb-ft @ 3,600 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Simply  checking off boxes no longer passes the test, no matter how capable a car may  be. When the current-generation Chevrolet Traverse debuted in 2018, we used  words like ""decidedly average"" and ""awkward"" to describe  it. It was at a disadvantage from the start, and the major refreshening it  received last year did little to significantly improve its standing. 
The  2023 Chevrolet Traverse returns unchanged from last year, and while we award  points for its responsive acceleration, intuitive infotainment system, and  impressive passenger and cargo space, those traits are not enough to draw even  with rivals. The Traverse suffers with poor rearward visibility and an interior  rife with far too much hard plastic, making it look and feel out of place among  competitors that flirt with entry-level luxury. On top of that, class leaders  deliver more features and higher-quality interiors for less.
As  a result, we suggest checking out the competition before deciding on a Chevy  Traverse. The Kia Telluride is the best you can get, and it's also due for a  refresh in 2023. Likewise, you'd do well to test drive the Telluride's sibling:  the Hyundai Palisade with its more luxurious personality. We even recommend the  Honda Pilot, despite the current-generation Pilot predating the Traverse by a  few years. The Traverse isn't a bad car — we'd call it about average  overall, but there are several superior options to consider. We  recommend stepping up to the LT Leather trim for its many comfort and convenience items that you won't get on the base  LS model. In particular, the larger touchscreen and power liftgate are great  additions.

It's been a staple in Hyundai's lineup for more  than 20 years and was one of the brand's first SUVs. Though it's been a part of  Hyundai's ascendancy from budget-brand to near-premium automaker, the current  Santa Fe has been out since 2019 and needs something fresh to leave a real  impression on us.  
Luckily,  Hyundai's done just that and added an all-new plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powertrain  to the 2022 Santa Fe. It allows you to drive a short distance on all-electric  power — around 30 miles, according to the EPA — before  switching over to operate like a regular hybrid. You can charge the Santa Fe's  battery pack at home or at a public charging station, and doing so frequently  can really help reduce your use of gas. 
Hyundai  starts the PHEV version at the SEL trim level, so there's no base SE trim like  there is on the gas-powered Santa Fe. That, plus the price premium of its  powertrain, results in an elevated starting price. But we think there's still  solid value here. The PHEV is laden with premium features such as heated front  seats and a wireless smartphone charging device, and you're getting a stellar  10-year/100,000-mile warranty too.
The  Santa Fe's competition includes rivals such as its corporate cousin, the Kia  Sorento Plug-In Hybrid, as well as slightly smaller SUVs such as the Ford  Escape Plug-In Hybrid and Toyota RAV4 Prime. Overall, we think it's worth a  look if you want an SUV that's efficient, quiet and spacious.  We  think the SEL Convenience sets you  up nicely with a number of standard features, like heated seats, a  power-adjustable driver's seat, power-folding rear seats, wireless device  charging, and keyless entry with push-button start. It also includes blind-spot  warning and rear cross-traffic warning systems. Those residing in cooler  climates may want to upgrade to the Limited package for more comfort options  such as heated rear seats and a heated steering wheel alongside technology  add-ons like a surround-view camera system and an automated parking system.",Inline 4 cylinder ,200, 258 lb-ft ,front wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

Last year, Jeep gave the  Compass updated interior and exterior styling, more in-car tech and additional  standard features. For 2023, Jeep is back at it again. This time, the Compass  gains a new turbocharged engine that's more powerful and fuel-efficient than  the one it replaces.  
Having  200 horsepower as standard is pretty impressive, and the extra power should  result in noticeably quicker acceleration. The EPA estimates the Compass will  get 27 mpg in combined city/highway driving. That's 2 mpg better than last year  but still a bit below what some other small SUVs are capable of. Other  enhancements include a new eight-speed automatic transmission, standard  four-wheel-drive for all models, and the addition of a drowsy driver monitor  and a rear seat reminder system.
For  a while, there weren't many other SUVs in this tweener segment, with most  rivals being either smaller or larger than the Compass. Not so anymore. Rivals  like the Chevrolet Trailblazer, Mazda CX-30 and Volkswagen Taos are some of  Edmunds' favorites, offering plenty of features and space for the price. We  think they're better buys overall as the Compass can get pretty expensive if  you add a lot of options to it. But none of those models are as off-road  capable as the Compass. It's worth a look, especially the Trailhawk version, if  your needs skew off the beaten path.  We  suggest stepping up from the base Sport trim to the Latitude trim.

Certainly, with its 24-valve, 3.0-liter V6, all-aluminum body, mid-engine layout and traditionally Honda-correct ergonomics, the NSX is a heckuva car.  But the best sports car ever made?  We're not too sure about that.For 1995, the slow-selling NSX got a targa roof and a slick new transmission called SportShift that operates much like Porsche's Tiptronic.  The targa option increased sales of the NSX by 100 percent in 1995 so the concept is being carried over to 1996.  The hardtop has been reintroduced this year in the hopes that it will broaden the NSX's appeal.  While we don't doubt that this is an alluring car, it seems that there are a limited number of  Americans who are in the market for $80,000 Japanese two-seaters, especially since the LT4 Corvette offers equal peformance for half the asking price and Dodge's Viper offers nostalgic styling, a throaty V10, and is a guaranteed babe magnet.  Witness the difficulty that other excellent Japanese sports cars have been experienceing over that past few years.  The Nissan 300 ZX is getting axed, the Mazda RX-7 is not having a 1996 model shipped to the US because of all of the 1995s sitting in showrooms and the Toyota Supra lost its six-speedmanual transmission on turbo models due to ever increasing emissions requirements.Still, the exotic looks and excellent engineering of the NSX should prove to be attractive and we would be saddened by its departure.

There are some good midsize SUVs available. This is not one of them. Honda's Passport competes poorly against midsized SUVs despite being a powerful, attractively styled alternative to the market leaders. Offering one of the stronger engines in its class, Passport changes little for 2000. Bolder exterior features, a few new standards and a new, upscale EX-L model are the main differences from the 1999 model. Honda has added aggressive-looking front and rear fascias, a modified grille and redesigned front combination lamps to the Passport. Four-wheel-drive models also get a standard limited-slip rear differential, providing greater traction to the rear wheels. All models come standard with 16-inch alloy wheels and tires. Last year's arguably useful hatchgate is now an option, as all spares can be stored underneath. The interior provides user-friendly ergonomics, but plastic trim feels somewhat cheap. Clamber aboard and head for the hills -- it's easy with push-button 4WD and standard antilock brakes that help you try to thwart nature's attempts to impede your progress.All trim levels are offered with two- or four-wheel drive and come with a powerful 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine making 205 horsepower to whisk you along with verve. The new EX-L (luxury package) model distinguishes itself with eye-catching two-tone paint, color-keyed bodyside moldings, fender flares and leather-trimmed seats and interior door panels. An AM/FM stereo system with in-dash six-CD changer is available only on the EX-L.  Finishing touches on its top model include a leather-wrapped steering wheel, woodgrain interior trim and, for when you're hopelessly lost on the off-road highway after dark, map lighting to find your way back to civilization and a safe covered parking spot.Problems with the Passport exist. The location of the push-button 4WD switch is absurd, located directly next to the cruise-control button where it could be activated accidentally. Removable headrests, in lieu of the manual or auto-folding ones offered on competing models, don't have a place to go and could be a nuisance when you drop the back seats down for storage. Off-road, the Passport feels somewhat undersprung, but takes bumps and dips easily if speeds are kept down. Our final complaint is that the front seats are dreadfully uncomfortable.The Passport appears to be a good blend of old-fashioned truck toughness and modern-day carlike convenience. Though already pleasant to look at, this Honda fails to please on a number of fronts. If you prefer the strong engine or the fancy EX-L, perhaps you'll even open your wallet for one.

XL trim level trucks now have optional bucket seats. Clean fuel (LEV) gasoline engines are standard on all Super Duty trucks. Power windows and locks are now standard on XLT trim levels. The trailer/tow mirrors now telescope manually. Rear bumpers are standard on all F-250 and F-350 pickups. All Super Duty trucks get new interior and exterior colors. Commercial/small business demand is one of the fastest growing segments in the expanding truck market. With its F-Series Super Duty trucks, Ford is aiming squarely at fulfilling this segment.The Super Duty trucks are built on a separate platform than the smaller F-150. The line of trucks comes in 84 different configurations, many of which are unique to the truck market. Ford Super Duty trucks are powered by a Triton 5.4-liter V8 or a 6.8-liter V10. The V8 generates 260 horsepower at 4,500 and 350 pound-feet of torque at 2,500 rpm. The V10 generates 275 horsepower at 4,250 and 410 pound-feet of torque at 2,650 rpm. A 7.3-liter diesel V8 is also available, and it makes 235 horsepower at 2,700 and 500 pound-feet of torque at 1,600 rpm.Ford Super Duty models are available in Regular Cab, SuperCab, and Crew Cab bodystyles. The overall look is much more aggressive than the standard F-150, and its bigger dimensions allow Ford to use larger cabs without compromising load space. Given their size, the F-250 and F-350 Super Duty trucks maintain a confident on- and off-road feel. They feature updated power steering systems and enhanced suspension components to improve vehicle ride, handling, responsiveness and maneuverability.  Just don't mistake them for a car. Unlike the F-150, Dodge Ram and Chevy Silverado (all of which have become much more comfortable and user-friendly these past few years), the Super Duty vehicles are true trucks. They ride harshly when unloaded and 4x4 trucks come only with manually locking hubs. These manual hubs (along with the solid front and rear axles) do give the Super Duty trucks improved off-road capabilities, however.Inside, the roomy cabs have larger, more comfortable seats and greater seat-track travel. In addition, there are many interior convenience features designed for today's stylish business owners. For example, a fold-down armrest and utility bin is designed to house a portable fax machine or laptop computer. In the Crew Cab XLT and Lariat models, a new rear bench seat incorporates a fold-down armrest and a cupholder. For truck owners who don't want to skimp on luxury, leather seating, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, air conditioning and power windows are just some of the many options available.

Highlights include a turbocharged 250-horsepower engine, all-wheel drive and improved handling and braking. With the revised BMW M3 still a year away, the twin-turbo, 250-horsepower, all-wheel-drive S4 sport sedan is a bargain. The new Audi S4 is the most promising sport sedan for 2000. Although not cheap by any means (base model pricing starts at $37,900), it does offer a mouth-watering array of features and improvements over the regular A4 Sedan that it is modeled after. Starting things out is a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 engine. Sporting twin intercoolers, dual-overhead cams, five valves per cylinder, variable valve timing for the intake camshafts, and optimized combustion chambers, the engine generates 250 horsepower and 258 foot-pounds of torque. Audi has designed the engine to provide much of its power low in the revband. Consequently, the S4 makes quick work of freeway on-ramps and passing maneuvers. Audi gives buyers of the S4 a choice of transmissions; there's a six-speed manual transmission or a five-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission. All S4s come with Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system, which constantly monitors the grip of the tires. When one of them starts to lose traction, the quattro system automatically applies power to the tires with the most adhesion to the road surface. Audi says this latest edition of the quattro all-wheel-drive system is capable enough to allow the car to get underway with only one wheel having reasonable traction. The suspension and braking components have also been improved. Major items of note are bigger and stronger brakes, revised aluminum suspension pieces, performance-tuned shocks and springs, and unique 17-inch wheels with 225/45R17 tires. The interior retains the same architecture found in the A4, which means an attractive design and a decent number of features. Special leather upholstery covers standard power seats, and contrasting color suede inserts can be had when ordering the sport interior package. Other options to consider include a sunroof, heated front seats, a six-disc CD changer, and a Bose premium audio system. For safety, there are standard front and head-curtain airbags. Outside, the S4 differs from regular A4s (not that the A4 is exactly regular, of course) by having the aforementioned 17-inch wheels, larger front air-intake openings, and S4 badging. Two special colors--Imola Yellow and Nogaro Blue--are available only on the S4. The S4 driving experience is a pleasure. But what could be considered either a positive or negative, depending on what you want from a sport sedan is the S4's suspension, which is softer than a '99 BMW M3. Its forgiving nature comes at the expense of pure handling excellence. Taken as a whole, however, we think the 2000 Audi S4 has no equal in the sport-sedan market.",V6 cylinder ,119," 258 lb-ft @ 1,850 ",front wheel drive ,
Hyundai,hyundai elantra,2002,hyundai elantra 2002,"['Solidly built, powerful engine for its class, plenty of standard features, ultra-low price tag.']",['Funky front styling details.'],4.6,"Hyundai's Elantra sedan was redesigned last year, but the big news for 2002 is the release of the GT version, an all-new five-door hatchback that boasts such upscale standard equipment as a leather-trimmed interior, European suspension tuning, four-wheel disc brakes, 15-inch wheels, foglamps and a CD player. In September 2002, Hyundai announced that it had misstated the horsepower ratings for all of the models in its lineup -- the Elantra is now rated at 135 , rather than 140. To compensate, the company is offering owners (of 2000 models and newer) three options: 10 years of roadside assistance, 6-year/72,000-mile basic warranty coverage or 12-year/120,000-mile powertrain coverage. An undeniable bargain at first glance. If the Elantra turns out to be as reliable as Hyundai's warranty suggests, we see no reason to buy the Japanese competition. Already a winner in our opinion, the amazingly competent Elantra got a complete overhaul last year, adding interior space and exterior size, along with a full load of standard equipment, without a substantial boost in the price. Stickering for less than $13,000 and sold in a single trim level with a handful of options, the refined Elantra competes head-to-head with the best in the compact sedan class, beating everyone on price if not overall quality.Elantra's 135-horsepower 2.0-liter DOHC engine provides decent acceleration. A four-speed automatic transmission is optional and features fuzzy-logic software to optimize shifting and hold a gear on hills, but we'd go with the less expensive manual transmission to extract maximum acceleration and value. A four-wheel independent suspension, multi-link with an antiroll bar at the rear, makes for smooth, stable handling, while the speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system communicates improved road feel to the driver. Four-wheel disc ABS is optional, as is traction control.Inside the Elantra, consumers will find a roomy cabin with supportive, comfortable seats front and rear. Extensive use of sound-deadening materials helps quiet this formerly buzzy compact car. Equipment levels are impressive, with power windows, locks and mirrors; side airbags; air conditioning; a cassette player; and 15-inch wheels standard. Options, aside from the ABS and traction control previously mentioned, are limited to a power moonroof, CD player, cruise control and a smattering of port- and dealer-installed goodies.Hyundai introduced the Elantra GT as a mid-year addition. Configured as a five-door hatchback, the GT is designed to appeal to those who might have purchased the discontinued station wagon model, as well as buyers who desire the utility of a hatchback configuration. The GT gets rear disc brakes, a sport-tuned suspension, alloy wheels and a host of other standard items such as leather seating, a CD player and fog lamps.Elantra also comes with an outstanding warranty. Called the Hyundai Advantage, this buyer-assurance program is a great incentive to buy a Hyundai over one of the many other compact choices on the market. Consumers receive an awesome 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. If the car is sold within those first 10 years, the new owner will still be entitled to the balance of a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. Also part of the program is 5-year/100,000-mile corrosion coverage and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty for 5 years or 60,000 miles. Additionally, the program offers free 24-hour roadside assistance for 5 years, which includes towing and lockout service. Attractive, well-equipped and backed up by one of the most extensive warranties in America, Hyundai has a winner in the upgraded and redesigned Elantra. Though it likely won't match the refinement or attention to detail found in segment leaders like the Honda Civic and Ford Focus, the savings to be found up front will certainly sway buyers for whom every penny spent up front counts.",Inline 4 cylinder ,130," 132 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Front and rear styling is refined, and the rear liftgate is now stamped from steel. Multiplex wiring is designed to improve reliability of the electrical system, while a new paint process aims to polish the finish of all Cherokees. Some things never change much, and the Jeep Cherokee is one of those mainstays.  Unlike its posh--and bigger--Grand Cherokee brother, which keeps adding comforts and graceful touches, the ever-practical, affordable Cherokee simply keeps on rolling, looking little different now than it did a dozen years ago.  This year, however, the Cherokee benefits from some overdue updates, including a new interior with dramatically improved instrumentation.Utilitarian and upright it is, but with a compelling personality that even the Grand Cherokee lacks.  Cherokee's squared-off edges are a bit rounder for 1997, with revised styling front and rear.  Inside, the new interior includes dual airbags, new controls and displays, and a new climate control system that improves air flow and reduces interior noise.  Fresh door trim panels, illuminated power mirror and power window switches, and a revised floor console round out the major interior changes.  Four adults fit inside the Cherokee in reasonable comfort, with fine head room.  Rear leg room is lacking, in a very short seat, and entry to the rear is constricted by a narrow door.  Worth noting is the fact that the rear bench folds but doesn't offer a split, meaning you can't haul a toddler and a treadmill simultaneously.Relatively refined on the road, the compact Cherokee is capable of strutting its stuff when the going gets rough.  Acceleration is brisk with the 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine, courtesy of 190 horsepower, and we highly recommend this upgrade if you select the SE model.  With the 4.0-liter engine, the Cherokee puts the ""sport"" into sport utility.SE and Sport models can have two or four doors, while the step-up Country edition is four-door only.  All are available with either two- or four-wheel drive.  Command-Trac part-time four-wheel drive allows shift-on-the-fly operation.  Selec-Trac is Jeep's full-time four-wheel drive system.  Standard gear includes power steering, tinted glass, and power front disc brakes.  Four-wheel anti-lock braking is optional (six-cylinder only), as are power windows and door locks, keyless entry system, cruise control, air conditioning, and leather seats.Other refinements for 1997 include new wiring designed to reduce complexity and improve reliability.  The rear liftgate is now stamped from steel and features hidden hinges.  This new design is lighter and easier to operate, with a new exterior handle and interior pull-down strap.  Bumper end caps and side moldings are better integrated into the Cherokee's design, and front windows are ventless for improved visibility.  Larger exterior mirrors make it easier to see out of the Cherokee, while new door seals battle to keep dust and noise from filtering into the cabin.  Finally, new robotic spray equipment at the factory makes metallic paint colors look better.Despite its age, the original compact Jeep sport utility remains a sensible choice in its field, more capable than most of heading into the woods at a moment's notice.

All-wheel drive.'],['There is a price to be paid for technology in terms of interior size and MSRP.'],4.7,"Tiptronic automanual gear shifting is standard, as is a glass sunroof, dual-pane laminated window glass, an improved stereo and an upgraded antilock braking system.   After 10 years, 40 patents and intensive collaboration with aluminum giant Alcoa, Audi has created the technological tour de force called A8.  Sporting senior A4 styling, sumptuous interior appointments and the revolutionary Audi Space Frame (ASF), the A8 is lighter, tighter and more responsive than competitors such as the BMW 7-Series and Mercedes-Benz S-Class.The ASF employs lightweight aluminum alloy construction designed to provide superior structural rigidity, improved handling and responsiveness, better fuel efficiency and easier recycling.  Two models are available; the A8 3.7 with front-wheel drive is powered by a 3.7-liter twin-cam aluminum-alloy V8 engine that produces 230 horsepower, and the A8 4.2 Quattro has all-wheel drive and a 300-horsepower 4.2-liter twin-cam aluminum-alloy V8 engine under the hood.  The 4.2 Quattro also comes standard with a 200-watt Audi/BOSE Music System.A8 3.7s are equipped with the same four-link front suspension design found on the A4.  This setup virtually removes torque steer while providing precise, neutral steering.  Both models have a fully independent rear suspension, which features passive rear-wheel steering to help stabilize the A8's handling  at all speeds.  Standard Electronic Differential Locking (EDL) provides low-speed traction control operating through the antilock braking system on all A8s, while the A8 3.7 also benefits from Anti-slip Regulation (ASR) which controls wheel slippage at all speeds by modulating engine power.Airbags are provided for all passengers.  Dual front airbags are supplemented by side airbags tucked into the front seats.  Rear passengers also get side airbags, mounted to the seat rather than the door panel.  Other features include special glass that blocks 99 percent of UV radiation and 30 percent of total radiation energy and a climate control system that circulates residual heat from the engine through the interior to keep things warm on very cold days.  Optional is a warm weather package that includes a power rear window sunshade and a solar sunroof that generates its own electricity to provide fresh air ventilation while the car is parked in the hot sun.Standard is an ergonomic interior slathered in burled walnut and Nappa leather upholstery. Instrumentation is superb and features soothing red nighttime backlighting.  Front seats are power adjustable in 14 different ways, and a memory feature accommodates four different settings for the driver's seat, exterior mirrors, driver's headrest height and steering wheel position.  The steering wheel tilts out of the way when the key is removed from the ignition.  The automatic dual-zone temperature controls employ two sunlight sensors to help maintain accuracy.  A central locking system controls windows, door locks, sunroof, trunk and fuel door.  All windows have one-touch up/down function, enhanced by a pinch protection system.For 1998, Audi modifies little on the A8.  The automatic transmission gets Tiptronic shifting controls, technically converting the transmission to automanual status.  A glass sunroof replaces the aluminum panel  design from 1997.  The ABS system and stereos are improved.  Xenon gas-discharge headlights are optional this year.  New colors include Melange and Andorra Red.Audi claims that the A8 4.2 Quattro will get from rest to 60 mph a hair under seven seconds.  Retail price  is exactly $65,000 at this writing.  In comparison, the 740iL runs a smidge more, while the Mercedes-Benz S320 short-wheelbase model runs a tad less.  The A8 3.7, at more than $57,000, is more expensive than the Cadillac STS, the Infiniti Q45 and the Lexus LS400.  Audi is on a roll lately, thanks to the excellent A4 sedan, which manages to undercut nearly all of its competition in the entry-level luxury class without sacrificing the luxury portion of the equation.

So maybe it won't come as a surprise that the Durango is  essentially the muscle car of the three-row crossover-SUV class. You won't find  a four-cylinder engine or a fuel-sipping hybrid setup here. Instead, Dodge  makes a V6 standard and then offers one of two strong V8 engines as optional  upgrades. 
Thankfully,  the Durango doesn't skimp on SUV utility in favor of straight-line performance.  The V8s offer class-leading towing capacity and, if you opt for four-wheel  drive, a low-range gearbox for more capability for off-road work or extra  traction on boat ramps. You also get a good amount of space for up to seven  passengers thanks to the Durango's large overall dimensions. 
Updates  over the years have managed to keep the Durango mostly fresh, with current  infotainment and other upgrades coming regularly. But those changes can't  entirely mask the fact that the Durango's platform is both old and heavy. That  means real-world maneuverability and fuel economy both take a hit, and the  weight hurts acceleration with the V6 engine. The interior packaging also isn't  as clever or efficient as in other three-row competitors.
While  the Durango has some definite strengths, its no-replacement-for-displacement  approach to everything does makes it a blunt instrument that isn't necessarily  well-suited to the needs of most three-row crossover shoppers. For the right  buyer, though, nothing else in the segment will offer such robust power and  towing. The  V6 engine is a bit outmatched in a vehicle this heavy, so we'd go with the R/T trim to unlock both the extra oomph  and the extra towing capacity.

Good for sub-7-second 0-to-60 acceleration runs, the S6 rides on a more muscular suspension structure to temper the 340-horsepower V8. Clark W. Griswold only dreamed about taking a family road trip in a car like the S6 Avant, which eliminates any compromise between driving pleasure and station wagon utility. As M is to BMW and AMG is to Mercedes, so S is to Audi. What do all these big, scary letters mean? They're performance-tuned versions of Germany's finest, bringing a keener shine to already bright constellations. The S6 Avant is no exception, and we applaud Audi's decision to crank up the volume on a station wagon, once construed only as a bland family vehicle.Propelling the S6 is a highly massaged version of Audi's 4.2-liter V8.Fiddling with the intake timing increases its horsepower output from 300 to 340 at 7,000 rpm. Plus, 310 pound-feet of torque peaking at a low 3,400 results in a powerplant that Audi claims should be good for mid-6 second zero to 60 acceleration runs. The thundering hooves are doled out by a five-speed Tiptronic transmission with steering wheel-mounted controls.Otherwise, what comprises the difference between the S6 and the A6? Aside from visual distinctions such as aluminum trim on the front grille, roof rails and side mirrors and the option to outfit the interior with special seat inserts, the S6 sports an all-aluminum suspension that whittles 24 pounds of weight. Springs are tauter by 30 percent while shocks have 40 percent increased damping compression, and its stance is lowered by one centimeter. It sports beefier brakes, and fatter diameter stabilizer bars keep body roll to a minimum. The 17-inch cast-alloy wheels ride on wide Z-rated tires. Safety equipment that stands guard to keep you from going overboard in the S6 Avant includes front and rear side airbags, side curtain airbags, Electronic Stabilization Program (ESP) with a traction control system, and ABS with brake assist. Of course, the S6 Avant comes with Audi's quattro all-wheel drive system which utilizes a Torsen center differential to ensure the greatest amount of traction on slippery roads. Standard equipment includes a premium stereo system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer; dual-zone climate control; power seats with heat, memory and lumbar support; a tilt/telescoping steering wheel that tilts away upon exiting; and an anti-theft alarm system. And you can't forget the 36.4 cubic feet of cargo capacity with the rear seat up and 73.2 cubic feet when the rear seat isn't utilized.  Available as options are high- and low-beam xenon headlamps, Alcantara leather trim, a navigation system, a rear parking sensor and heated rear seats. Nemo Blue is an S6-specific color that you can choose. Later in the year Audi will offer an OnStar telematics system with a digital telephone and Web browser. Audi offers four-year/50,000-mile free scheduled maintenance and roadside assistance for the same period.Piloting an S6 Avant, Clark Griswold would have no trouble catching up to the hot blonde in the red sports car.

How do you choose between a Chevrolet or GMC full-size van? Which dealer is closest to your house? They're basically the same vehicle. And these GM vans stack up well against the formidable Ford Econoline and ancient has-been Dodge Ram Van. As long as the Savana provides what you need in this kind of vehicle, it's tough to go wrong here. When the then-new Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van. The GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced way back in 1971 (when vans were groovy), and sold steadily until they were discontinued. Competition and safety regulations had forced GM to redo the big vans for '96, but by then Ford had already re-engineered the Club Wagon and Econoline twice! To help distinguish the all-new design, GMC rebadged its new van Savana. Savana features flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard four-wheel antilock brakes and dual airbags. Front foot- and legroom is adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of travel. Front air conditioning and rear heat ducts are standard, but for better warming (and cooling), an optional rear heating and air-conditioning unit is available. The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet and storage for items like CDs and cassettes. Savana is available in 135- and 155-inch wheelbases and three weight series (1500, 2500 or 3500). There is a choice of side-entry doors as well: a sliding door or a pair of 60/40 hinged doors.Inside the short-wheelbase Savana, you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the extended version provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume. Rear hinged doors open a full 180 degrees for easy loading and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened. Gross vehicle weight ratings of up to 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase. The base engine is a 200-horsepower Vortec 4300 V6 that is quieter and more durable this year, thanks to a new roller timing chain and rocker arms. Optional motors include the GM family of V8s, from the popular Vortec 5000, to the venerable 5700, to the monster Vortec 7400. Also available is a robust 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 good for 195 horsepower and 430 stump-pulling pound-feet of torque. A new exhaust system with specially designed catalytic converters help all but the biggest engines meet California low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards. GM's heavy-duty 4L80-E transmission handles all the shifting chores, featuring a more efficient torque converter. Savana's styling is rounded and bulbous, with a front end that mimics GM's truck family and a high-arched rear with D-pillar mounted taillights. Easily as odd-looking as the old Lumina minivan's high-mounted rear lamps, the round-topped rear and sheer size of this van make it seem as if you were looking at the rear of a commuter train car.

Subaru,subaru forester,1998,subaru forester 1998,['Handles like a car.  Accelerates like a car.  Rides like a car.'],['Travels off-road like a car.'],4,"Subaru attacks the mini-SUV market head-on with the Forester, which actually constitutes an SUV body on an Impreza platform with a Legacy engine under the hood. The most carlike of the mini-utes, Forester is also the most powerful. Airbags remain the full power variety, despite new rules allowing lower deployment speeds. What do you do when sport-utility buyers won't drive home in your all-wheel drive station wagon, which is dressed up like an SUV, because it's too ""wagony"" in appearance?  If you're gutsy like Subaru, you put a taller, more squared-off body on your wagon chassis, and call it good.  The new Forester is a Subaru parts bin exercise, and since the parts bin is rather small at Fuji Heavy Industries, which owns the upstart all-wheel drive automaker, the car is cobbled together from a mixture of Impreza and Legacy bits.Based on the rally-proven Impreza platform, the Forester uses the same AWD system found in other Subaru models.  The 2.5-liter boxer engine comes from the Legacy Outback and makes 165 horsepower in the Forester.  This means the Forester has gobs more power than its primary competitors.Also, thanks to its hunkered-down stance, low center of gravity, and car-based foundation, the Forester handles better than the Chevrolet Tracker, Honda CR-V, Suzuki Sidekick and Toyota RAV4.  The trade-off is lower ground clearance and less capable off-road ability, but you weren't going to go too far off the beaten path anyway, were you?  (Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.)Inside is room for four adults, with a rear center position marked off for a fifth rider in a  pinch.  Cargo space is equivalent to what you'd find in the RAV4 or Tracker, and storage room abounds.Three Forester models are available: the base, the mid-level L and the high-end S.  Air conditioning, roof rack, rear defogger, tachometer, power windows, tilt steering, rear wiper/washer and an 80-watt cassette stereo are standard on the base model.  The L adds antilock brakes, power door locks, and cosmetic  goodies.  With a base price barely over $20,000, we believe the L will be Subaru's volume seller.  The uplevel S gets a toothy chrome grille, alloy wheels, bigger tires, rear disc brakes, cruise control and upgraded interior trimmings.  Remote keyless entry is optional on the L and S, while leather can be added to the S only.  Options include CD player, alloy wheels, cruise control, trailer hitch and a variety of cosmetic upgrades.While we are partial to the Impreza Outback Sport and Legacy Outback models, the Forester will attract  buyers who want an inexpensive, functional all-wheel drive vehicle that looks like a truck and drives like  a car.  As long as Subaru can keep a lid on pricing, the Forester should pick right up where the Outback wagons leave off.",Flat 4 cylinder ,92," 162 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Chevrolet,chevrolet camaro,1997,chevrolet camaro 1997,"['Powerful engines, great styling, excellent performance value, standard ABS']","['Cheesy interior trimmings, macho image']",4.6,"Chevrolet celebrates the Camaro's 30th Anniversary with a special-edition Z28 that emulates the appearance of the 1969 SS Indy Pace Car with white paint, Hugger Orange stripes, and black-and-white houndstooth seat inserts. Interior revisions to seats, center console and dashboard freshen the look inside for 1997. Two new shades of gray are available for interiors, while exteriors get new green and purple hues. Tricolor taillamps debut, and new five-spoke alloy wheels are optional. On the safety front, daytime running lights are standard and side-impact regulations are met. ""From the country that invented rock n' roll,"" claimed the advertisements for this Quebec, Canada-built sport coupe when it was redesigned in 1993.  A small technicality, we suppose, but there are no technicalities when it comes to the Camaro's performance abilities, particularly in Z28 guise.  The Z is blazingly quick, holds the road tenaciously, costs less than the average price of a new car in this country, and gets decent gas mileage when it's not being hammered along a twisty two-lane road.For 1997, Camaro buyers will note few visual changes to their favorite pony car.  Tri-color taillights debut, snatched from export models of the Camaro.  Five-spoke aluminum wheels are newly optional, as well.  Two new exterior colors join the paint roster; Bright Green Metallic and Bright Purple Metallic.  Interiors are slightly revised, with new seat contours, a revised center console that now includes four cupholders, and a slightly restyled instrument panel.  Radios are new, and a 12-disc CD changer is optional.The Camaro celebrates its 30th birthday this year, and Chevrolet will release a special-edition Z28 to commemorate the event.  Painted white with Hugger Orange stripes, the 30th Anniversary Camaro will sport a white interior with black-and-white houndstooth inserts.  White leather is optional.  Like other 1997 Camaros, daytime running lights will be standard on this limited production model.  Yeah, like someone won't see this white and orange fire-breathing Z28 coming down the road.The base Camaro engine is the 3800 Series II V6, which makes 200 horsepower.  That's 45 more ponies than Ford's Mustang can produce.  Phased in during the 1995 model year, the 3800 V6 can be mated to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission.  With a manual, this powerplant gets the Camaro to 60 mph nearly as quickly as a Ford Mustang GT.  In fact, the existence of this powerplant makes a strong argument for avoiding the higher insurance rates and prices of the Z28.  An optional Performance Handling Package puts bigger tires, alloy wheels, tighter steering, four-wheel disc brakes and a limited slip differential on the V6 Camaro.From a bang-for-the-buck standpoint, the Z28 is unbeatable.  A Corvette-derived 5.7-liter V8 gets 285horsepower to the pavement through the rear wheels.  The SS version of the Z28 makes 300 horsepower, thanks to a big air scoop on the hood that forces cool air into the engine.  SLP Engineering, known for working magic with GM's F-bodies since the late '80s, does the conversion work on the Z28 SS.  See your dealer for details.  The interior of the Camaro is functional, if not slightly garish.  The Camaro holds a respectable amount of gear in the cargo hold (more than 33 cubic feet of space with the generally useless rear seats folded down), and airbags and antilock brakes are standard.  More mature drivers can order traction control, but that option defeats some of the fun of Chevy's ponycar: smoky, adolescent burnouts that leave the drivers behind choking on charred Goodyears.",V6 cylinder ,301," 225 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Toyota,toyota sequoia,2002,toyota sequoia 2002,"['Ultra-refined drivetrain, surprisingly agile handling, versatile and comfortable interior, impeccable build quality.']","['Non-descript styling, comparably low towing capacity.']",4.6,"The Sequoia is virtually unchanged for 2002. SR5 models have two additional stand-alone options this year: keyless remote and front foglamps. A thoroughly capable full-size SUV that beats Ford and General Motors at their own game. Toyota is going after a sizable chunk of the full-size SUV market with its 2002 Sequoia. Introduced just last year, it slots between the 4Runner and Land Cruiser in price but not size.Larger than a Tahoe or Yukon and about the same size as an Expedition, the Sequoia's length, width, height, wheelbase and interior space all measure greater than the Chevrolet and GMC, while third-seat room and cargo space is on par with all three competing models. The Sequoia only offers eight-passenger capacity, compared to a maximum of nine occupants in the Tahoe, Yukon and Expedition. Built on the same platform as the Tundra truck, the Sequoia incorporates a few key modifications to help it deliver a more docile ride. Structurally identical to the Toyota Tundra pickup from the front doors forward, the Sequoia gets additional frame reinforcement and a sophisticated five-link coil spring rear suspension for improved ride quality and control. Despite its imposing size, the big brute feels surprisingly agile around town, with an easy-to-drive character more akin to a Camry than a full-size sport-ute. The Sequoia is powered by a smooth and silent 4.7-liter V8 making 240 horsepower and 315 pound-feet of torque using regular unleaded fuel. It's also the first Toyota truck to be certified as a ULEV (ultra-low-emission vehicle). Two- or four-wheel-drive models are available. The Sequoia's maximum towing capacity tops out at 6,500 pounds (6,200 on four-wheel-drive models), a respectable, though significantly less stout, figure than its heavier-duty competition.Safety features are plentiful. All Sequoias come with a traction control system and Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), Toyota's stability control system that helps to maintain the vehicle's cornering stability in situations where the truck is about to lose traction and skid sideways. Other hardware includes antilock brakes with Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD), dual front airbags and three-point seatbelts for all seating positions (the front belts have force limiters and pre-tensioners, while all positions except the driver's are ALR/ELR, allowing for easier installation of child seats). Side airbags along with head-protection side curtain airbags are optional.Two trim levels are available: SR5 and loaded-up Limited. The latter buys you standard gear like leather seating, power retractable exterior mirrors, dual air conditioning, seat heaters, ten-speaker JBL sound system and aluminum wheels. Limited also includes third-row seating, privacy glass, a roof rack and a tow hitch. Both models offer outstanding comfort for both front and rear passengers.The Sequoia is built alongside the Tundra pickup truck near Terre Haute, Ind. A loaded-up Sequoia certainly isn't cheap, but compare similarly equipped Expeditions and Tahoe/Yukons, and you'll find that the Sequoia prices out almost identical to its domestic competition. If you want one, consider this: Toyota expects to build only 60,000 Sequoias annually. We predict a serious shortfall, resulting in demand that far outstrips supply.

Chevrolet,chevrolet express,2001,chevrolet express 2001,"['Modern styling, powerful range of engines, lots of cargo-hauling capacity.']","['Odd arched-eyebrow taillamps spoil clean design, not as refined as Ford Econoline.']",4.1,"A new LT trim level with leather and an on-board entertainment system, and a more powerful V8 are the only major changes.  Two new exterior colors and upgraded radios and alternators round out the updates for 2001. Choices when it comes to full-size vans are easy to make. Do you want a Dodge, a Ford or one of the Chevy/GMC twins? If the Express offers the package you need in a full-size van, then buy it. When Chevy dealers received a brand-new, full-size van to sell in 1996, it marked the first time in 25 years that GM had completely redesigned its big vans. The resulting Chevy Express comes equipped with a cavernous interior and a variety of powerful engines. With its modern design and body-on-frame construction, Chevrolet is stealing some of Ford's thunder in the full-size van market.Because most full-size vans are bought for conversion into rolling motel rooms, engineers put the Chevy Express on a full-frame platform for improved stability. Regular-length models carry 267 cubic feet of cargo, and extended-length vans can haul 317 cubic feet of stuff. Trick rear doors open 180 degrees to make loading and unloading easier. Standard side cargo doors are a 60/40 panel arrangement, but a traditional slider is a no-cost option on 135-inch wheelbase vans.  Up to 15 passengers can ride in the extended-length version, making it perfect for use as an airport shuttle. Other seating options include five-, eight- and 12-passenger arrangements. G3500s can tow up to 10,000 pounds when properly equipped.For convenience, the full-size spare is stored underneath the cargo floor. A 31-gallon fuel tank keeps this thirsty vehicle from frequent fill-ups, but topping off an empty tank will quickly empty your wallet.  An 8.1-liter V8 replaces last year's 7.4-liter engine providing a class-leading 340 horsepower and 455 ft-lbs. of torque.  Other powerplants include the 4300 V6, 5000 and 5700 gasoline V8s, and a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8. A new LT trim level debuts midyear giving Express buyers a luxury level option that includes leather seating, a Bose sound system, OnStar telematics, and flip-down monitors connected to a VCR and game system.  Base and LS models still offer standard safety features like child safety locks on the rear and side doors and handy assist handles to help folks climb in and out. Base Express vans include front air conditioning (front and rear air conditioning is optional), vinyl seats, AM/FM stereo, antilock brakes, and daytime running lights.  The LS adds power windows and locks, cruise control and tilt wheel.Exterior styling is an interesting mix of corporate Chevrolet, Astro Van and old Lumina minivan. We'll admit the high, rear pillar-mounted taillights are odd looking, but at least they're functional.  They can easily be seen even if the van is operated with the rear doors open. Low-mounted bumpers and moldings make the Chevy Express look much taller than it is. An attractively sculpted body side gives the van's smooth, slab-sided flanks a dose of character, as does the quad-lamp grille arrangement. For 2001, two new exterior colors debut, Light Pewter and Meadow Green, along with a new Dark Pewter interior color.Overall, Chevrolet's rendition of the traditional full-size van appears to be right on target, giving Ford's Econoline its only real competition.",V6 cylinder ,285," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Ford,ford fusion,2018,ford fusion 2018,"['Great combination of sharp handling and a composed ride', 'Quiet interior with an elegant design and high-quality materials', 'Abundance of available advanced safety equipment', 'Optional all-wheel drive for cold-weather climates']",,3.7,"The 2018 Ford Fusion hasn't changed  dramatically in the last few years, and that's a good thing. The Fusion is in a  highly competitive class of midsize sedans, but it continues to impress us with  its comfortable interior, user-friendly tech and great driving dynamics.  The 2018 Fusion would also be lost  in this class if it weren't for its high-quality interior and abundant  available safety equipment. Available items such as adaptive cruise control, an  automated parking system and forward collision mitigation should definitely  appeal to the safety-conscious, while Sync 3's excellent controls should  satisfy the tech crowd. The Fusion has a few flaws, but most  of them are related to base versions of the car and they can be dealt with via  a few upgrades. For instance, the base 2.5-liter engine doesn't have much  power, but three available options offer improved performance. So while the  2018 Ford Fusion may look relatively similar on the outside to Fusions from  years past, the rest of this midsize sedan has been continually updated to  assure that it remains a top competitor in the class.Notably, we picked the 2018 Ford Fusion as one of Edmunds' Best AWD Sedans, Best Midsize Sedans and the 2018 Fusion Sport as one of the Best Sport Sedans for 2018. Stylish, luxurious and fun to drive, the 2018 Ford Fusion is a midsize family sedan that can do it all. Like its midsize-sedan rivals, the Fusion is spacious and practical, but it has the added bonus of providing a bit of driving and styling flair, which help it stand out in the class. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our Full Test of the 2017  Ford Fusion SE EcoBoost (turbo 1.5L inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | FWD). The optional 1.5-liter turbo four-cylinder engine gets the Fusion moving at a decent clip, but it's far from quick. In Edmunds performance testing, the 1.5L Fusion went from zero to 60 mph in 8.9 seconds, which is slower than average for the segment. The brakes on the Fusion inspire confidence, they're easy to modulate in traffic, and performance at the track was very consistent. In a simulated-panic stop from 60 mph, the Fusion (on all-season tires) needed only 116 feet, which is very good for the class. The Fusion's steering is nicely weighted, and it returns to center willingly. Though low-speed parking is a breeze, there's almost no feeling of connection to the road through the steering during spirited driving. Despite the steering's lack of driver-to-road connection, the Fusion handles and maneuvers quite well. The chassis feels solid, the suspension minimizes body roll, and it isn't upset if it encounters a bump midcorner, so curvy mountain roads pose little drama. The Fusion comes up short in some performance areas, but overall it's an enjoyable car to drive. In the city it's easy to maneuver, and it has excellent brake responsiveness. The standard six-speed automatic transmission shifts smoothly but leisurely. The standard cloth seats are nicely padded and offer a great balance of support and comfort that lasts for hours. But we found it harder to be comfortable in the optional leather seats, which feel taut and stiffer. Nice adjustable front headrests; outboard rear seats are set at a pleasant angle. The Fusion feels planted in most scenarios, and it isn't upset by most small imperfections in the road. Out on the highway, the ride can feel a bit floaty without passengers or cargo, but it's not bouncy or uncontrolled. The 1.5-liter engine rumbles a little under full acceleration, but otherwise the cabin is relatively quiet, especially on the highway. A minor amount of wind and road noise makes its way into the cabin. Automatic climate control isn't standard, but it did come on our midlevel SE test car. The system performed adequately in hot weather, but the climate control buttons are small and laid out in a somewhat unconventional way. It takes some time to learn the system. The cabin features a rotary transmission shifter that takes some getting used to. But most cabin controls are nicely grouped and easy to operate at a glance, though a few of the buttons are on the small side. Steering wheel buttons make it easy to sort through the comprehensive dashboard screen. Most occupants will find it easy to climb in and out of the Fusion thanks to wide-opening doors, generous door openings and seats that are set at an inviting height. The only exception is the sloping rear roofline, which might prompt those over 6 feet tall to duck as they slide into the backseat. Driving posture is comfortable and readily adjustable. Tilt-and-telescoping wheel has a generous adjustment range. Cloth and leather seats both offer height adjustments, but tall drivers should know that the 10-way power mechanism doesn't allow the leather seats to go as far down as the cloth ones. The Fusion feels spacious, and its front and rear seats provide above-average levels of head-, leg- and hiproom. Rear headroom is impacted somewhat by the sloping rear roofline, but only those over 6 feet tall should notice. The optional sunroof takes a bite out of headroom. Outward visibility is good despite fairly thick windshield pillars, but the rear blind spot is larger than average due to a broad rear roof pillar and a smaller than average rear-quarter window. A rearview camera is standard, and parking sensors are optional, which is typical in this segment. No significant squeaks or rattles, but several panels on the inside and exterior were slightly misaligned on our test car. The quality of materials is acceptable for the price, but the higher trim levels help the Fusion feel less like a rental. Storage spaces include a large bin under the front armrest and a spacious tray under the center console. Both front and rear center armrests have two cupholders, and there's one in each of the wide door pockets. None will hold anything larger than an average-size water bottle or a coffee cup. A wide trunk opening with a low liftover height and standard 60/40-split folding rear seats give you easy access to the Fusion's very large trunk. With 16 cubic feet of volume in the trunk alone, the Fusion has more cargo space than the Accord, Camry, Malibu and Mazda 6. Sync 3 and its onboard navigation are much better than the old MyFord Touch system. Like a smartphone, Sync 3 has big virtual buttons and the ability to swipe through menus. Satellite radio signal was often dropped, though, likely due to a weak antenna, and high-volume audio quality isn't very good. All Fusions with Sync 3 have Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality and a second USB port. If you don't utilize these systems, you can still pair your phone via Bluetooth, which is a nice option to have. As always, Ford's voice controls, now via Sync 3, are excellent. Natural language and simple commands do wonders to play music, change radio stations, input navigation destinations or place calls. And you have the option to hold the voice button longer to access Siri on your paired smartphone. The 2018 Ford Fusion offers a wide  range of trim levels and features, but we think the Fusion SE with one of the optional engine upgrades is a good start  for most buyers. The optional 1.5-liter engine offers a slight increase in  power over the standard 2.5-liter engine along with improved mileage. For even  more punch, there's the optional 2.0-liter engine, which can also be paired  with all-wheel drive. One additional option worth considering is the Technology  package with Sync 3. It gives you Ford's latest, most user-friendly technology  interface that includes numerous useful features.  The base Fusion S comes standard with the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine  (175 , 175 lb-ft), front-wheel drive, a six-speed automatic transmission,  16-inch alloy wheels, automatic headlights, LED taillights, a rearview camera,  cruise control, air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, cloth  upholstery, a height-adjustable driver seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats,  audio and phone voice commands (Sync), Bluetooth connectivity, smartphone app  integration and a four-speaker sound system with a 4.2-inch center screen, a CD  player, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB port. For a few more creature comforts,  the Fusion SE adds 17-inch wheels,  LED daytime running lights, exterior  keypad entry, an eight-way power  driver seat (with power lumbar), a six-way power passenger seat, rear heat  ducts, a rear center fold-down armrest and a six-speaker sound system with  satellite radio. Optional for the S and SE is the Appearance package, which features  18-inch alloy wheels, foglights, a rear spoiler, a leather-wrapped steering  wheel and special cloth upholstery. The SE is also available with the Luxury package (Equipment Group 202A),  which adds the turbocharged 1.5-liter engine (181 , 185 lb-ft) with automatic  engine stop-start to help save fuel, LED headlights and foglights, keyless  ignition and entry, remote ignition, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and  driver-side mirror, heated mirrors, leather upholstery, driver-seat memory  settings and heated front seats. Opting for the SE's Technology package equips the Fusion  with rear parking sensors, dual-zone  automatic climate control, an 11-speaker sound system, the Sync 3 technology  interface (with an 8-inch central LCD touchscreen and two configurable gauge  cluster displays), enhanced voice controls and an additional USB charging port. The Fusion Titanium gets all of the SE's optional features, plus it  comes standard with the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine (240 , 270 lb-ft),  18-inch wheels, LED taillights, a rear spoiler, ambient interior lighting,  sport front seats, eight-way power adjustment for the passenger seat, a premium  12-speaker Sony sound system and HD radio. The Fusion SE (with the Technology  package selected) and Titanium can also be equipped with a navigation system,  an automated parking system for parallel and perpendicular parking, and  adaptive cruise control with frontal collision warning and stop-and-go traffic  capability. For the SE and Titanium, Ford additionally offers the Driver Assist package, which includes  automatic high-beam control, automatic wipers, a 110-volt power outlet, a  heated steering wheel, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and a  lane departure warning and lane-keeping assist system. A sunroof is optional  for both the SE and Titanium, and the Titanium can be had with 19-inch wheels  and ventilated front seats. The borderline luxury-level Platinum trim includes all of the above  features in addition to a unique grille insert, upgraded leather trim and a  power-adjustable steering wheel. If you're looking for a sporty  version of the Fusion that still has some top-end features, the V6 Sport starts with features from the  SE with the Luxury package and adds a turbocharged V6 engine (325 , 380  lb-ft), all-wheel drive, a different grille, 19-inch wheels, quad exhaust tips,  a rear spoiler, adjustable suspension dampers, leather and simulated suede  upholstery, and a nine-speaker audio system. The V6 Sport Upgrade package (Equipment Group 401A) is about as high up as you  can go in a Fusion, and it includes most of the features from the Titanium  trim. It is also available with the Driver Assist package and the stand-alone  options listed above.",,201," 174 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",front wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

Doen't offer the ultility or value of the Honda CR-V.""]",4.6,"Toyota's mini SUV enters its third year of production with minor changes to the grille, headlights, taillamps and interior. Four-door RAV4s get new seat fabric. A late-year introduction of the new RAV4 convertible makes this sport-ute more appealing for those who live in the sunbelt. The mini-SUV business is booming.  Introductions of fresh models by Honda, Kia and Subaru indicate that there continues to be a large market for those who want the security of an AWD truck without the punishing ride and gas mileage that goes with it.  Largely comprised of car-based AWD vehicles, this new market will gain even more entrants over the next few years as Land Rover, BMW and Mercedes introduce small trucklets to the US.  One of the early players in the game was Toyota, which recognized this potential boom early on and jumped into the fray with the RAV4 in 1996.A 2.0-liter, 120-horsepower engine hooked to either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission powers the front or all wheels of the different RAV4 models.  This makes the RAV4 the first sport utility available with front-wheel drive.  All-wheel drive models use powertrain components from the now-defunct Celica All-Trac.  Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional on all RAV4s.  Minimum ground clearance is 7.5 inches on the four-door model; two-door RAV4s get .2 additional inches of clearance.The RAV4 is a pretty decent around town driver, handling more like the car from which its platform is derived than a traditional SUV.  Power is on the low side, however; the 120-horsepower engine works hard to drag this mini-ute up even small hills.  The interior is not a bad place to spend time, offering fairly comfortable seating for four adults in the four-door models.  The cargo area of the four-door is larger than one would expect, too, offering more room behind the rear seat than a Ford Crown Victoria.  Two-door models are fine for singles or couples without children.  The rear seat is tiny, and less than 10 cubic feet of cargo volume is available with the back seat up.The Toyota RAV4 is a convincing package.  Its eye-grabbing looks appeal to those who are young or just  young at heart.  Around college campuses the RAV4 litters the streets in front of Greek Row more than smashed bottles of Boone's Farm.  Surprisingly, however, we have also seen the RAV4 towed behind a large number of motor homes that swoop into Arizona, Texas, and California every winter, leading us to believe that they are a hit with the more mature crowd, too.  We are fond of the RAV4, but there are a number of choices in this growing segment and we can't help but think that the more refined and powerful Honda CR-V might offer shoppers more of what they are looking for in a small truck: power, utility and value.",Inline 4 cylinder ,210," 132 lb-ft @ 4,600 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Naturally, the company  also improved it to keep up with new regulations, so the Savana has  cutting-edge standard technology like a backup camera. And let's not forget  about the marvel that is Bluetooth.  
But  at 27 years of age and counting, the GMC Savana is positively ancient in  automotive years. Still, the Savana and its twin, the Chevrolet Express, are  not without merit. They're the last truck-based full-size vans available, and  they can tow more weight than any of their remaining rivals. They can carry a  substantial payload too. Plus, they're less expensive than the Ford Transit,  Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and Ram ProMaster.
Full-size  vans have taken a big step forward since the Savana was designed and  engineered. For example, the Ford, Mercedes and Ram all offer high-roof options  that allow their vans to pack in more cargo or make it easier to load and  unload people. Plus, the Savana's newer rivals offer a wider array of  configuration, more options, and modern infotainment and safety technology. You  can even get all-wheel drive on the Ford and Mercedes.
While  there is some appeal in the Savana's tried-and-true design and its low starting  price, we suggest checking out the other vans in this segment. If  you're getting a Savana Cargo Van, it comes only in the Work Van trim level, so  you have no choice in the matter. When it comes to the Savana Passenger Van,  however, we suggest that you skip the LS in favor of the LT. It includes comfort, convenience and safety features that make  living with this rolling relic a little more palatable.",V6 cylinder ,375," 298 lb-ft @ 3,900 ",front wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

All-wheel drive.'],['There is a price to be paid for technology in terms of interior size and MSRP.'],4.7,"The A8's warm weather package is modified to improve electronic accessory performance, while dual-pane laminated glass replaces insulated glass. Standard on the A8 is a larger right outside mirror, a first aid kit and a CD changer. A premium leather/Alcantara trim package and a new Volcano Black exterior paint color are optional. A8 prices will remain unchanged from 1998. The A8 just keeps getting better.  Sporting senior A4 styling, sumptuous interior appointments, and the revolutionary Audi Space Frame (ASF), the A8 is lighter, tighter and more responsive than competitors such as the Mercedes-Benz S-Class.The ASF employs lightweight aluminum alloy construction designed to provide superior structural rigidity, improved handling and responsiveness, better fuel efficiency and easier recycling.  Two models are available: the A8 3.7, which has front-wheel drive and is powered by a 3.7-liter twin-cam aluminum-alloy V8 engine producing 230 horsepower, and the A8 4.2 Quattro, which has all-wheel drive and a 300-horsepower 4.2-liter twin-cam aluminum-alloy V8 engine under the hood.  The 4.2 Quattro also comes standard with a 200-watt Audi/Bose Music System.A8 3.7s are equipped with the same four-link front suspension design found on the A4. This setup virtually removes torque steer while providing precise, neutral steering.  Both models have a fully independent rear suspension, which features passive rear-wheel steering to help stabilize the A8's handling at all speeds. Standard Electronic Differential Locking (EDL) provides low-speed traction control operating through the antilock braking system on all A8s, while the A8 3.7 also benefits from Anti-slip Regulation (ASR), which controls wheel slippage at all speeds by modulating engine power.Airbags are provided for all passengers.  Dual front airbags are supplemented by side airbags tucked into the front seats.  Rear passengers also get side airbags, mounted to the seat rather than the door panel.  Drivers will find an interior slathered in burled walnut and Nappa leather upholstery.  Instrumentation is superb and features soothing red nighttime back lighting.  Front seats are power adjustable in 14 different ways, and a memory feature accommodates four different settings for the driver's seat, exterior mirrors, driver's headrest height and steering wheel position.  The steering wheel tilts out of the way when the key is removed from the ignition.  The automatic dual-zone temperature controls employ two sunlight sensors to help maintain accuracy. A central locking system controls windows, door locks, sunroof, trunk and fuel door.  All windows have a one-touch up/down function, enhanced by a pinch protection system.For 1999, Audi modifies its warm weather package to improve the performance of electronic accessories such as garage door openers and electronic toll passes.  The package no longer includes insulated glass.  Standard on the 1999 A8s is a larger right outside mirror for improved visibility, a first aid kit in the center console and a CD changer.  A premium leather/alcantra interior trim package and a new volcano black exterior paint color are available.Retail prices have not changed for 1999, despite the addition of more standard equipment.  You can still buy an A8 3.7 for $57,400 and a 4.2 Quattro for $65,000.  Audi claims that the Quattro will get from rest to 60 mph in less than seven seconds.  Audi is on a roll lately, thanks to the excellent A4 sedan, which manages to undercut nearly all of its competition in the entry-level luxury class without sacrificing the luxury portion of the equation.  Time will tell if the rather expensive A8's technological advances and standard equipment are desirable enough to bring BMW, Lexus and Benz intenders into Audi showrooms.",V8 cylinder ,215," 235 lb-ft @ 2,700 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed automatic

All Imprezas benefit from improvements in performance, refinement and safety. Along with the Impreza's trip upmarket come revised trim levels consisting of two sedans (WRX and 2.5 RS) and three wagons (WRX, Outback Sport and 2.5 TS Sport Wagon). The coupe body style has been dropped. From the Sport Wagon to the WRX, the all-wheel-drive Impreza is an affordable and enjoyable alternative to more mainstream cars. Subaru has always marched to the beat of a different drummer, and rather than try to compete directly with the small sedans from Honda and Toyota, Subaru goes its own way by offering a few things those mainstreamers don't: big power, all-wheel-drive and a wagon body style.  The Impreza has been redesigned for 2002 and is available in five trim levels: 2.5 RS sedan, WRX sedan, 2.5 TS Sport Wagon, Outback Sport wagon and WRX Sport Wagon. Powering these Imprezas are a 2.5-liter, 165-horsepower, horizontally-opposed (or ""Boxer"") four-cylinder engine for the RS, TS, and Outback models, and a turbocharged 2.0-liter Boxer kicking out an impressive 227 horsepower for the rally racing-inspired WRX. The Boxer engine layout allows for a lower center of gravity, which contributes to better handling.  Transmission choices are a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic.  All Imprezas have fully independent suspension and antilock brakes. The high-performance WRX and 2.5 RS versions get four-wheel disc brakes with the 2.5 TS and Outback models having a more conventional front disc and rear drum arrangement.  Subaru claims that safety, handling and ride qualities have all been improved via its Ring-Shaped Reinforcement Frame body structure and overall increased structural rigidity. The former promotes greater protection in a collision (be it frontal offset, side or rear) while the latter enhances the Impreza's handling and ride. Standard equipment levels are generous. The 2.5 TS has air conditioning, height-adjustable driver seat, power windows/locks/mirrors and an 80-watt stereo with CD deck. The Outback Sport adds bigger (16-inch) wheels, two-tone paint scheme, massive fog lights, floor mats and cargo area enhancements that include a power point and hidden storage compartment. The RS features a sport-tuned suspension with a wider front track, four-wheel disc brakes, high-performance tires on its 16-inch alloys, sport seats and leather wrapping for the steering wheel, gear shifter and handbrake handle. Enthusiasts who want something they can really sink their feet into should look at the WRX. The all-out Subie has the performance hardware mentioned earlier as well as a functional hood scoop, limited-slip rear differential, dual-outlet exhaust and the option of 17-inch wheels. Inside the cockpit are alloy pedals, front side airbags, 6-disc CD changer, sport seats and a Momo leather-wrapped steering wheel. High power and relatively low weight allow this rocket to blast from zero to 60 mph in just over six seconds. And the all-wheel drive means that those who live in less than perfect climates can enjoy this performance car all year round. Offering a generous helping of standard safety, performance and luxury features, the Impreza lineup strikes us as a nice alternative to run-of-the-mill small cars.",Flat 4 cylinder ,195," 166 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

It was intimate, inherently prioritizing the needs of the  driver and the sole passenger. Its non-turbocharged V8 engine soared to  stratospheric revs, further underscoring its sense of occasion.  The 2019 Audi RS 5 is part of the model's  second generation, which debuted last year. While it's traded some of its V8  character for a new twin-turbo V6, the new engine packs more punch,  particularly in the lower part of the rev range. What hasn't changed is the  sure-footedness delivered by Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive system, as well as  an interior trimmed with world-class quality materials and technology. There are minimal changes for 2019  models, but updates include the addition of enhanced navigation and Audi's  high-definition widescreen digital gauge cluster (called Virtual Cockpit) as  standard equipment. There's also a new body style, the RS 5 Sportback, which  combines everything we love about the coupe-inspired-by-a-sedan and a, er,  sedan. Imagine the same general shape as the RS 5 coupe, but longer, swoopier  and four-doors-ier. Thrilling as the RS 5 is, it's not  without fault. There's not much cargo or cabin space, at least in the coupe.  The Sportback potentially solves that issue, offering nearly double the cargo  capacity behind the front seats. The suspension modes are either a little too  rough or a little too sedate. And the engine sound, arguably the most visceral  connection we'll have with the car, is a bit of a muted letdown compared with  the sparkle of the previous generation's V8. Incredibly capable and by all measures a  top luxury sports car, we can't help but feel the RS 5 lacks a certain bite we  expect of cars in this class, especially those with the feral roots of Audi's  RS program. An RS 5 can dominate the road but may not inspire you to find new  ones. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the Audi RS 5 w/ Dynamic and Dynamic  Plus packages and Dynamic Steering (turbo 2.9L V6 | 8-speed automatic |  AWD). The RS 5 turns in an impressive 0-60 mph time of  3.7 seconds and can pull a full g around the skidpad, which means high levels  of road grip. Subjectively, it's missing some of the excitement expected of an  RS car. In Sport mode, it transforms into a very dynamic performer, but it does  so by using sophisticated differentials that simulate a neutral or even loose  rear end, which ends up feeling artificial.In  normal driving modes, there's a significant lag before the engine spools up and  starts moving the car. And after some spirited use in our tester, we found the  brake pedal got noticeably soft and the front rotors emitted loud squeals. What the RS 5 surrenders in excitement it makes up  for in touring comfort. The front seats offer great lateral support without  being confining, and they're also shaped well for long-distance drives. The  difference in ride quality between Comfort and Dynamic modes is very noticeable.  In Dynamic mode, it gets much stiffer, yet it can maintain composure without  riding harshly.Likewise,  the cabin remains quiet at high speeds and over rougher pavement. Road noise is  present, but only just so. The engine and exhaust sound good off the bat, and  even better in Dynamic mode if not a bit synthetic. We're fairly certain the  aural experience involves using the speakers to pipe in some of that sound. The RS 5 uses Audi's last-generation interior  design, which is much more user-friendly and less distracting. Unlike the newer  layout, you get a good number of physical buttons, which means you won't have  to dig through touchscreen menus. Every control is thoughtfully placed and has  a solid and quality feel to it.It's  easy to access the front seats, and once there, it feels as though you're  sitting just a bit tall for a sporty sedan. Rear passengers will likely have to  stoop a little to clear the sleek profile of the rear roofline. Headroom is a  bit snug back there, as is legroom due to tight toe space under the front  seats. Visibility is good aside from a thick rear roof pillar that sits  squarely in your over-the-shoulder view. The Sportback's hatch can hold up to 21.8 cubic  feet, which is very useful for a sport sedan like this. The only things missing  back there are remote releases for the rear seatbacks. It's a long reach to  fold them flat, so some people may need to do so from the rear doors. Up  front, there are plenty of places to store your personal effects, and we  especially like the small tray that ably holds your phone. The door pockets and  cupholders could stand to be a little bigger. All but the largest rear-facing  infant seats should be accommodated with little effort. Some people may prefer the RS 5's  last-generation infotainment system more than the new version, as we do. The  infotainment display is right in the driver's sight lines. And the dial  controller is less distracting than a touchscreen to navigate menus with.  Programmable shortcut buttons are a bonus amenity. Apple CarPlay and Android  Auto are standard, booted up quickly and were glitch-free in our testing.The  adaptive cruise control functions well, with smooth reactions to changing  traffic conditions. The front parking sensors can often be too sensitive,  turning on while in bumper-to-bumper traffic. They're adjustable to some degree  to reduce the beeps. With only one trim level, the only decision is which options to add. The RS Driver Assistance package has useful features including adaptive cruise control and a top-down camera view. The Dynamic package is good for the variable dampers, but skip the pricey Dynamic Plus package, of which carbon-ceramic brakes are the headlining item. Also consider the Dynamic Steering, which simply makes the car more enjoyable more of the time. Standard equipment includes 19-inch  wheels, LED headlights, a sunroof, parking sensors, automatic wipers,  auto-dimming and heated side mirrors, keyless entry and ignition, and  three-zone automatic climate control. In-car tech comes in the form of an  8.3-inch infotainment display, a navigation system, a 10-speaker sound system,  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a configurable digital gauge cluster  display (Virtual Cockpit).A suite of driver assistance systems  — forward collision alert with automatic emergency braking, rear  cross-traffic alert and intervention, and blind-spot monitoring —  also comes standard. From here, Audi offers a variety of  option packages to choose from. Included in these packages are mechanical  upgrades such as carbon-ceramic front brakes, variable suspension dampers, a  sport exhaust and variable-ratio steering. If you want driver assistance  features such as adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams and a lane  keeping system, tick the box for the RS Driver Assistance package. Other RS 5 optional features include  different 20-inch wheel designs, carbon-fiber exterior trim, premium leather  upholstery, and a Bang & Olufsen sound system.

The most significant change is the availability of a new ""Symphony"" special edition for LE models. This special edition includes items like keyless entry, a roof rack, captain's chairs for the first two rows (six-way power driver seat), a premium JBL audio system, power swing privacy glass, color-keyed heated power side mirrors, an overhead console with HomeLink and painted bumpers and cladding. There's also a new color this year exclusive to the Symphony: Lunar Mist Metallic. The base CE model's Extra Value package now includes a roof rack and keyless entry for no extra cost. No more exciting than a toaster, but comes close to being the perfect minivan appliance. Despite the fact that it's five model years old and doesn't offer as much utility and functionality as newer competitors, the Toyota Sienna is one of the top choices in the minivan class. With the Sienna, Toyota has placed an emphasis on safety, quality and performance.There are three models: the base CE, the mid-level LE and the top-level XLE. All come standard with five doors. Under the hood is a smooth, powerful and refined 3.0-liter V6 mated to a four-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. This powertrain setup can also be found in the Toyota Camry, fitting since the Sienna is built on a stretched and modified Camry platform. In the Sienna, the engine produces 210 horsepower and 220 pound-feet of torque.The Sienna's rigid and lightweight unitized body performed exceptionally well in government crash tests. Standard safety features include ABS, front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters, front height-adjustable seatbelt anchors, a low tire-pressure warning system and daytime running lights. Every Sienna can also be ordered with optional side airbags and a stability control system that helps prevent dangerous skids and spins.The Sienna driving experience is similar to the Camry in that it's pleasantly non-confrontational. Steering is sure, if not quite nimble. The suspension does a good job of soaking up road imperfections, and wind noise is kept to a minimum. Braking is exceptionally competent. Acceleration from the V6 is acceptable for almost all situations, and the cabin is quiet at highway speeds.The Sienna was designed to offer optimum interior roominess in a compact, easy-to-maneuver package. The interior has a definite Camry feel to it, constructed and trimmed in high-quality materials. Dual power doors are optional, and removable modular seating allows for custom configurations to accommodate a variety of cargo requirements. A second-row bench seat or captain's chairs and third-row seats can be folded or removed to accommodate bulkier cargo. Third-row seats also add a 50/50 split-folding and tumble feature for additional cargo space, but can't match many competitors for overall user-friendliness. What the Sienna needs to remain competitive in the class is a third-row seat that folds flat into the floor like newer models from Honda and Mazda. More comfortable front seats would help, too, as the current chairs are firm yet unsupportive and don't offer a wide enough range of adjustment.Overall, Toyota does not make the biggest or most useful minivan, but it does make a reliable, safe, well-performing and refined alternative to a number of family haulers on the market.",V6 cylinder ,98," 220 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

An oversized Camry wagon that went equipment- and clothes-shopping at REI. It's not a real SUV, but it's a really nice SUV pretender. Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle.Longer, taller and wider where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus, the Highlander could almost fool you into thinking you were driving a family sedan. Riding on a fully independent suspension, this SUV exhibits none of the tippiness that we've experienced in other sport-utes. There are two engine choices: a standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder or a 3.0-liter V6. The four-cylinder makes 155 horsepower and 163 pound-feet of torque, while the smooth V6 puts out 220 ponies and 222 lb-ft of twist. A four-speed automatic transmission is the only one offered, and it provides a ""snow mode"" for easy starts on slippery surfaces. Tow ratings are on the light side, the maximum being 3,500 pounds with a properly equipped V6 model.The Highlander comes in both two-wheel- and four-wheel-drive configurations. Similar to the RAV4's and Lexus RX 300's, the 4WD system applies a 50/50 torque split between the front and rear wheels on a full-time basis. In the event of tire slippage, torque is automatically applied to whichever wheel needs traction. Rather than serving serious off-road duty, the system is intended to prove useful in foul weather, as it helps the tires to maintain grip even on rain-slicked and snow-coated roads.Additional safety comes from standard antilock brakes equipped with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes braking power during a panic stop). Toyota also offers Vehicle Skid Control (VSC). This system, which includes traction control, is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the vehicle back under control.Toyota also equips the Highlander with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR), front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional.Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear 60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded. Passenger accommodations are roomy, with a high ceiling and decent legroom for all passengers. However, the rear seats should be placed higher for better thigh support, and the Highlander does not offer a third-row seat like many other mid-side SUVs do.It does get air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, bottle holders and grocery bag hooks as standard. Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size spare, foglights, privacy glass and other upgraded features. Leather upholstery is available on V6 models.On the whole, we have found the Highlander to be an extraordinarily competent station wagon/sport-utility crossover.

ABS is now standard on all models. A new Edge trim level has a monochromatic appearance, which includes color-keyed bumpers and wheel lip moldings. Exterior changes are numerous. All models get a new grille, bumpers, and headlamps, while the XLT 4x4 and Edge get a new hood and wheel lip moldings. Four colors are new as well as an optional in-dash, six-disc CD changer. Despite its substantial age, the 2001 Ford Ranger is still one of the wiser choices in the compact truck market. Whether it's image or utility that attracts you to a compact truck, Ford stands ready to seduce you into its strong-selling Ranger. The standard engine on 2WD models a new 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine. A 3.0-liter V6 (no longer flexible fuel) is standard on 4WD models, and the Explorer's SOHC 4.0-liter V6 is now available packing 207  at 5250 and 238 lb-ft at 3000 rpm. That's a 47  jump over the previous pushrod 4.0-liter motor.With the larger V6, acceleration is now even more sprightly, especially from a standstill or when merging and passing. As before, the big engine comes only with the five-speed automatic transmission. Rotary-knob controlled four-wheel drive is a unique pulse-vacuum system.Well-controlled overall, with good steering feedback, Rangers handle easily, corner capably, maneuver neatly, and stay reasonably stable on curves. Occupants aren't likely to complain about the ride, either, though it can grow bouncy around town. Gas mileage isn't the greatest with the big engine and automatic.The four-door SuperCab--available in 2WD and 4WD--makes it easy to access the storage compartment from either side of the truck, a big assist when loading cargo and gear. The standard rear doors on SuperCab models hinge off the corner pillars of the cab and swing out 90 degrees from the doorsill. There are no B-pillars to obstruct loading. Completing the Ford Ranger pickup line are regular cab, short- and long-wheelbase 2WD and 4WD models.The Ranger is equipped with dual airbags and side-impact protection beams. The rear doors for 2WD and 4WD SuperCab models also have side-door intrusion beams for extra safety protection. ABS is standard on all models, and the passenger airbag can be shut off using a dash-mounted switch.Ford has had the best-selling small trucks in the country for years. Fun to drive, sharp looking and well built, the Ranger delivers a solid compact-pickup experience. Its most serious competition comes from the Dodge Dakota and Toyota Tacoma models.

Pricing is up as well, pushing this Hyundai squarely into Dodge Neon and Honda Civic territory. The Excel is long dead, and it's time to stop thinking of Hyundai as a second-rate automobile manufacturer.  Last year, the Accent and Sonata provided a strong hint that this South Korean automaker was finally learning how to build a good car.  This all-new 1996 Elantra provides the proof.  Larger and more powerful than the first-generation Elantra, this new car offers quite a bit of bang-for-your-buck in either sedan or new-for-1996 wagon bodystyle.Under the hood is a 130-horsepower 1.8-liter Hyundai-designed ""Beta"" engine, which produces 90 percent of its torque at 2,300 rpm, resulting in snappy around town performance.  Riding on a four-wheel independent suspension, the new Elantra features a longer wheelbase and wider track, which contributes to smoother, more stable handling.  An all-new speed-sensitive rack and pinion steering system communicates improved road feel to the driver.  GLS models can be ordered with four-channel antilock brakes, which read each wheel separately.Dual airbags debut on the Elantra this year, housed in a two-piece dashboard designed to reduce the development of squeaks and rattles.  Side impact beams mounted in the doors meet 1997 safety standards.  Adjustable headrests and seatbelt anchors are standard, and all models come with driver's side lumbar support and seat height adjustments.  GLS models get a 60/40 split folding rear seat.  Extensive sound deadening materials have also been added to the Elantra.Base price for a five-speed sedan is $10,900.  This price includes five-mph bumpers, rear window defroster, dual remote control mirrors, rear seat heat ducts, remote fuel and trunk releases, tilt steering, and speed-sensitive steering.  Another $2,250 nets buyers a GLS model with an automatic, cassette stereo, power door locks, power outside mirrors, six-way adjustable driver's seat, split fold rear seat, power windows, four-wheel disc brakes, and performance-oriented tires.  Add Option Package 11 to the GLS, and you'll get air conditioning, cruise control, and antilock brakes, bringing the MSRP to $15,040 plus destination.Good value?  Let's take a look.  A Civic LX sedan equipped with air conditioning, automatic, and anti-lock brakes runs $15,850.  A similarly-equipped Dodge Neon Highline comes in under $15,000, including ABS.  A sporty Pontiac Sunfire SE sedan with a powerful 2.4-liter engine stickers for $15,500 and includes traction control.  A fully loaded Kia Sephia GS will cost $13,290.The 1996 Hyundai Elantra is much-improved over its predecessor.  But like other Hyundai products, once a few options are added, the value disappears.  The Pontiac offers superior content, the Dodge superior performance, the Honda a better reputation, and the Kia better value.  If Hyundai had priced the Elantra a bit more down market, it would make a compelling choice.  We like this new Hyundai, but as it stands, the new Elantra is likely to be passed over by most consumers, simply because of the nomenclature affixed to the decklid.",Inline 4 cylinder ,279," 122 lb-ft @ 5,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

It gets the new  2.5-liter engine, which significantly improves the driving experience. The  Sport also comes with simulated leather upholstery, heated front seats and  unique styling flares. On top of that, we recommend adding the optional 8-inch  touchscreen. How does the Crosstrek drive? With the base powertrain, the Crosstrek can seem painfully slow when accelerating onto the freeway. But the 182- 2.5-liter engine shaves nearly 2 seconds off its 0-60 mph acceleration, bringing it down to a respectable 8.4 seconds. Combine that with communicative steering and above-average off-road capability and you've got a seriously competitive extra-small SUV.     Handling, however, is underwhelming. The Crosstrek's hard tires provide only modest grip on pavement, and the tall ride height brings about noticeable body roll when you crank around a turn. Most rival SUVs offer a more enthusiastic on-road driving experience. How comfortable is the Crosstrek? With a relatively quiet and smooth ride, the Crosstrek is easy to drive on long trips. And with the optional 2.5-liter engine, there's less noise in the cabin too. There's still a bit of a growl when you bury the throttle to make a passing maneuver, but the sound is a bit more pleasant than the standard 2.0-liter engine's wheezy soundtrack.     The front and rear seats are comfortable for extra-long road trips, even if they are a bit on the firm side. But if you find yourself on a twisty road, you'll quickly discover the front seats a little lacking in the bolstering department. The climate control system is easy to operate, with several large, easily readable dials, but some of the vents are located in inconvenient spots. How’s the interior? The Crosstrek's cabin is highly functional and well laid out. The high-resolution screens have large fonts and simple menu structures. The lifted ride height of the Crosstrek (compared to its sibling, the Impreza) makes it easy to get in and out of and delivers excellent visibility. The driving position is good too, with lots of adjustment from the tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel.    There's plenty of room in both the front and back seats, and the Crosstrek offers one of the more spacious cabins in the class. The only space that will be slightly cramped is the rear seat, but just for taller passengers. How’s the tech? Standard features including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto give the Crosstrek an easy entry point for tech-savvy users. The crisp center screen is appealing, and voice controls allow for changing things, such as the radio station, with only a few small tweaks to everyday language.     The optional eight-speaker Harman Kardon stereo (Limited trim only) is an upgrade from the standard setup and offers some extra volume and increased audio quality. The navigation display is easy to see and understand. The Crosstrek's lane-keeping assist system intervenes pretty regularly, but not to the point of being overzealous or annoying. How’s the storage? Interior storage is a little below average. There's 20.8 cubic feet of storage behind the rear seats or 55 cubes when you fold the seats down. Small-item storage is a bit limited, so you'll have to be creative when storing your personal items. Child seats can be installed very easily thanks to the large door openings and high roof. How’s the fuel economy? With the 2.5-liter engine (which is only available with the CVT), the Crosstrek gets an EPA-estimated 29 mpg combined (27 city/34 highway). That's pretty good for an off-road-friendly compact crossover SUV. Real-world fuel economy isn't as impressive, however. On our 115-mile highway-heavy evaluation route, our Crosstrek Limited returned 27.5 mpg. It does have a long range thanks to its big 16-gallon fuel tank, which is 20%-30% larger than most rivals. Is the Crosstrek a good value? Subaru offers a good number of features for what you pay. Our test car had solid build quality. There are lots of nice soft-touch surfaces on the inside of the Crosstrek, especially at the top Limited trim level. A top-trim Mazda CX-30 is nicer still, but overall the Crosstrek easily justifies its cost.    Subaru's three-year/36,000-mile warranty is average for the class, but it covers items such as wiper blades and brake pads — that's rare and appreciated. This is where the Crosstrek shines. There are only one or two vehicles in this class that can go as far off the beaten path as the Crosstrek, especially when you consider available features and the low price point. It's a gateway into the outdoors with a bit of its own flash, style and finally enough horsepower.",,255," 145 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 6-speed manual

Chevrolet,chevrolet malibu,1997,chevrolet malibu 1997,"['Amazing value, standard A/C, standard anti-lock brakes, available V6 engine']",['No traction control or integrated child seat available'],3.6,"First year for new midsize sedan with classic name. Chevrolet is producing good cars and trucks.  Witness the excellent values to be found in the Blazer, Camaro, Cavalier, and Lumina.  With the introduction of the 1997 Malibu, it's hard to go wrong when visiting a Chevy dealer for a bread-and-butter sedan.Consumer clinics determined much of the Malibu's design.  Engineers used a nearly identical methodology when concocting the recipe for the successful Lumina.  What consumers have demanded is a tight, solid, roomy, fun-to-drive mid-sized sedan.  Guess what?  Chevrolet delivers, and delivers big.  The Malibu is all of these things and more, wrapped in unobtrusive but not ugly sheetmetal, and sold at a price that undercuts similarly equipped imports and domestics.Two models are available.  The base Malibu features a 2.4-liter twin-cam four-cylinder engine, the same one found under the hood of the Cavalier Z24.  Gears are shifted automatically, and standard equipment includes four-wheel anti-lock brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, battery rundown protection, theft deterrent system, tachometer, air conditioning, rear seat heat ducts, tilt steering wheel, and remote trunk release.  Step up to LS trim, and you leave the showroom in a fully loaded car.  The LS includes a 3.1-liter V6 engine, aluminum wheels, fog lights, remote keyless entry, power driver's seat, power windows and door locks, cruise control, uplevel stereo, and a trunk cargo net.While we haven't driven the Malibu at this writing, performance figures dictate that this Chevy goes, slows, and turns corners well enough to be entertaining.  Interior design elements include a handy left-handed cupholder, backlighting for major controls and switches throughout the interior, and heating and air conditioning ducts located on the A-pillar to help direct air flow to rear seat passengers.  Also notable is the dash-mounted ignition switch.  Moving the switch from the steering column to the dashboard means the driver doesn't have to crane his neck around to find the ignition slot.Safety concerns are covered by the Malibu.  Dual airbags, four-wheel antilock brakes, and child safe rear door locks are standard.  According to Chevrolet, side-impact door beams exceed 1997 federal standards for protection.  Maintaining the Malibu has been made easy with platinum-tipped spark plugs that last 100,000 miles, engine coolant designed to last five years or 150,000 miles, and transmission fluid that never has to be changed or checked.Our list of gripes is short, at this point.  The fake wood in the LS is unnecessary.  We also want to find an integrated child safety seat on the options list in the future.  And why can buyers get traction control on the Cavalier but not the Malibu?  The Malibu's standard second-gear start feature, does, however, help make up for the lack of traction control.We're impressed by the new Malibu.  Evidently, both Motor Trend and AAA are as well.  Motor Trend named the Malibu Car of the Year for 1997, and AAA calls the Malibu the best car to buy in the $15,000 to $20,000 range.  Great job, Chevrolet.",Inline 4 cylinder ,200," 155 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Audi,audi a4,2001,audi a4 2001,"['Available quattro all-wheel drive, powerful 1.8T motor, attractive exterior styling.']","['Confusing dash layout, not much rear legroom, quattro version can feel lethargic.']",4.4,"The entire Audi lineup receives a new 4-year/50,000-mile limited warranty and no-charge scheduled maintenance, a 12-year limited warranty against corrosion perforation, and 24-hour roadside assistance for four years. All A4s are now equipped with head protection airbags, have lengthier oil change intervals and an optional Electronic Stabilization Program (ESP). The 1.8T engine gets a horsepower boost from 150 to a racy 170 and meets ULEV standards. There may be a host of improvements for the 2002 A4, but we're plenty fond already of this iteration, especially the sleek sheet metal. Audi's A4 is sleek, sophisticated, speedy and has won praise from the worldwide automotive media. Small and safe, the A4 has scored well in government crash testing. For U.S. buyers, this translates into a competent alternative to the BMW 3 Series, the Acura TL and the Volvo S40, among others. For 2001, four versions are available: the A4 1.8T Sedan and 1.8T Avant Wagon, and the A4 2.8 Sedan and 2.8 Avant Wagon. The numerical designations refer to engine size. The 1.8T models get a 1.8-liter turbocharged engine that now produces 170 horsepower and 166 foot-pounds of torque. Vehicles with a 2.8 designation have a 2.8-liter V6 filling their engine bays. The six-cylinder makes 190 horsepower and 207 foot-pounds of torque. Both engines can be ordered with a five-speed manual or a five-speed Tiptronic automanual transmission. Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard on Avant wagons and optional on the sedans.Besides engine selection, the 1.8T vehicles differ from the 2.8 models in only minor trim. The 2.8 Sedan and Avant have bigger wheels and tires, 10-way power seats, aluminum trim on the window frames, and wood interior decor. All cars feature goodies like a new Sport 3-spoke steering wheel with Tiptronic control buttons for the auto tranny, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, heated outside mirrors and windshield-wiper nozzles, an eight-speaker CD audio system, and 60/40 split folding rear seats.Avant wagons have 31.3 cubic feet of cargo room with the rear seat up and 63.7 cubic feet of cargo room with the seat folded down. They also come with a retractable rear luggage cover, a luggage net, and a three-point center seatbelt. Tether anchors for a child seat are standard as well.Audi buyers can also personalize their cars by choosing from three different interior themes: Ambition, Ambiente and Advance. The three environments, as Audi calls them, differ by the texture and appearance of the seat upholstery and the color and type of genuine wood or aluminum trim. Main options offered by Audi include a Bose premium sound system, a six-disc CD changer, a navigation system, and sport seats.With prices starting in the mid-20s, consumers can get a status car that's comfortable and costs less than it does to send your kid to college. Pricing can escalate when heavily equipped, but the A4 is still one of the best entry-luxury sedans on the market.",Inline 4 cylinder ,115," 166 lb-ft @ 1,950 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Also available are daytime running lights with auto-off. Vintage Red Pearl, Sable Pearl and Woodland Pearl replace Sunfire Red Pearl, Ruby Red and Classic Green Pearl. The Camry is still favored by most Americans as the best mid-sized sedan. This despite a new-and-improved Honda Accord in '98. Camry's boast room inside for five adults, attractive yet conservative styling, exceptional pep from an available 24-valve 3.0-liter V6 and a price that doesn't break the bank, as long as options are kept to a minimum.In '97 the Camry was redesigned with the goal of becoming America's best-selling car. It succeeded but has faced increasing competition from the Accord and Ford Taurus in '98 and '99.New and old Toyota customers have fallen in love with the Camry because of its reliability, durability and good value. The Camry can be equipped for rugged family life, or plush luxury touring. Options on higher-grade LE and XLE models include a premium sound system, leather interior trim and a power moonroof. With the V6 engine, the Camry accelerates strongly. Braking is swift and sure with the antilock system, and Camry hangs on well in corners despite rather meek all-season radials.Inside, controls and gauges are laid-out nicely in a flowing dashboard, and most secondary controls are within easy reach of the driver. We are big fans of the fingertip cruise control stalk that allows easy operation without the chance of inadvertent activation. If you want a practical sedan without sacrificing all aspects of performance, the Camry CE can be had with a potent V6 and a five-speed manual transmission.Storage areas are abundant and feature a deep center console, door bins, and dashboard bins. Front cupholders, the feature by which all cars are truly measured these days, accommodate 20-ounce bottles of your favorite beverage.The Camry's suspension could be a little stiffer, but otherwise this is Toyota's all-around winner?and the sales charts prove it.",Inline 4 cylinder ,168," 147 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

It blends the same wealth of improvements made to the 2017 A4 along with the wagon body style, elevated ride height, standard all-wheel drive and rugged body cladding that differentiated the outgoing Allroad. The Audi  Allroad wagon is redesigned this year, but you might not know it just by  looking at the pictures. Check out our photos of the 2017 Audi A4 Allroad. Now  compare them to the 2016 Allroad. Hard to tell the difference, right? The  grille and lights are a little different, but otherwise a 2017 Allroad looks a  lot like a 2016 Allroad. But do some research and you'll realize there's a lot  more than meets the eye with the 2017 Allroad. The 2017  Audi A4 Allroad wagon builds on the previous Allroad's credentials by borrowing  heavily from the recently redesigned and highly rated A4 sedan. Compared to its predecessor, the 2017 Allroad is lighter  and has a more sophisticated all-wheel-drive system and a new engine that is  both more powerful and fuel-efficient than before. Inside, an all-new design maintains Audi's  reputation for creating innovative cabins of impeccable quality. The revised  MMI infotainment system, with its updated controller, new dash-top screen and  available Virtual Cockpit gauges, represent a step forward both aesthetically and functionally. As before, though, the Allroad's  calling card is its extra ground clearance, which helps you out when driving on  rutted dirt roads or during the occasional snowstorm.One of the  few areas that the 2017 A4 Allroad is lacking is in its competition —  crossover SUVs have replaced wagons in most shoppers' lists. But you might want  to also check out the BMW 3 Series wagon and Volvo V60 Cross Country. The 3  Series doesn't have the off-road clearance that the Allroad does, but it is a  little sportier to drive, while the V60 offers Swedish flair and a new engine  this year. If you need more interior space than these wagons provide and don't  mind a non-luxury badge, a loaded-up Subaru Outback could be the way to go.  Overall, though, the newest Allroad looks to be the best at combining a  luxurious interior, impressive performance and just enough enhanced off-road  capability to make you forget about crossover SUVs all together. Standard  safety features for all 2017 Audi A4 Allroad models include antilock brakes,  stability and traction control, side curtain airbags, a rearview camera, Audi's  Pre Sense Basic system (pre-tensions seat belts and closes windows and sunroof  during emergency maneuvers) and the Pre Sense City system (forward collision  warning with automatic emergency braking).Features  available or standard on higher-trimmed Allroads include rear seat airbags,  front and rear parking sensors, Audi Connect Care emergency telematics  (includes emergency assistance, stolen vehicle locating and automatic crash  notification), Audi Pre Sense Rear (adds rear collision detection to the  existing Pre Sense system), blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert, lane departure warning and automatic high beams. You don't necessarily need to buy a luxury crossover SUV to get utility. Check out the redesigned 2017 Audi A4 Allroad. This small wagon can haul a fair amount of stuff, and its extra ground clearance and standard all-wheel drive will help you out when the road or weather turns nasty. We have  yet to fully test the 2017 Audi A4 Allroad, but all signs point to it being  comparable to the A4 sedan, which is a very good thing. The sedan received  excellent scores for acceleration, braking and handling, further bolstered by  the surefootedness of the all-wheel-drive system. Among the few drawbacks, we  noted some hesitation upon initial acceleration and a lack of steering feel.In  addition to the expected on-road manners, the Allroad also benefits from some  light off-road capabilities thanks to its extra 1.3 inches of ground clearance.  It's a far cry from what a dedicated SUV such as a Land Rover Range Rover can  do, but rutted, unpaved roads and snow-covered conditions should pose no  threat. The 2017  Audi A4 Allroad shares much of its interior with the A4 sedan, which received  high praise in our evaluations. Materials quality is excellent, even for this  luxury class, with sturdy design and construction. The sharp infotainment  screen is placed high atop the dash, keeping more of the driver's attention on  the road. The MMI system takes some getting used to, but after a short time,  operation becomes second nature. The same can be said of the available virtual  instrument panel that adds a distinct high-tech edge to the cabin. Most of  the Allroad's interior measurements remain identical to the A4 sedan, which  likely means it will feel as spacious. When evaluating the sedan, we commented  that the cabin felt more like a midsize luxury sedan, with an abundance of  space for front and rear passengers. Six-footers could easily fit in the rear  seats, and the Allroad even gains an advantage with slightly more headroom.The rear  seats are split in three sections, allowing for more flexible passenger and  cargo configurations. Cargo space is generous for the class, with 24.2 cubic  feet available behind the rear seats and 58.5 cubic feet with them folded. Standard  features on the base Premium trim include 18-inch wheels, underbody skid  plates, xenon headlights, LED running lights, automatic wipers, heated mirrors,  roof rails, a panoramic sunroof, a power liftgate, cruise control, an adaptive  suspension, selectable drive modes, and forward collision warning and  mitigation.Inside,  you also get tri-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, keyless  ignition, eight-way power front seats (with driver four-way power lumbar  adjustment), 40/20/40-split folding rear seats, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, interior ambient lighting, Audi's MMI  infotainment system, a 7-inch central display, a rearview camera, Bluetooth  connectivity, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone app integration, and a  10-speaker audio system with a CD player and two USB ports.The  Premium Plus trim adds LED headlights, power-folding and auto-dimming mirrors,  front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry, Audi Connect Care (emergency  telematics), heated front seats, driver memory functions, a 19-speaker premium  Bang & Olufsen surround-sound system and satellite radio. This trim is also  eligible for the Technology package option that adds a navigation system,  expanded Audi Connect services (including 4G LTE connectivity and in-car Wi-Fi  hot spot), a virtual instrument panel inside the gauge cluster, a toucad  infotainment controller, mobile apps (for travel, information and  entertainment) and advanced safety features (rear collision preparation and  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert).At the top  of the range, the Prestige trim includes all of the above, along with  acoustically insulated front windows, a head-up display, enhanced interior  lighting and a surround-view camera system.Many  features are offered on supporting trims as options. Other add-ons include the  Sport package (front sport seats and a black headliner), the Cold Weather  package (heated steering wheel and rear seats), the Warm Weather package  (ventilated front sport seats and rear window sunshades) and the Driver  Assistance package (adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, automatic  high beams and traffic sign recognition). Rear-seat side airbags are available  as a standalone option.Powering  the 2017 Audi A4 Allroad is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that  produces 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. A seven-speed dual-clutch  automatic transmission sends power to all four wheels. Hill descent control is  also included.Audi  estimates the Allroad will accelerate to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds, which is about  average for wagons in the class. The  EPA estimates fuel economy at 25 mpg combined (23  city/28 highway), which is also similar to other small luxury wagons.",Inline 4 cylinder ,138," 273 lb-ft @ 1,600 ",front wheel drive , 7-speed automated manual

But we have been  let down by this generation's anonymous driving experience and poorly  thought-out infotainment system controller. Lexus hopes the improvements it  made to this year's RX will rectify these shortcomings. 
Lexus  says it retuned the suspension and stiffened the body structure to give the RX  a slightly sportier feel when driven around turns while still keeping ride  comfort paramount. The F Sport's sport suspension — which previously  resulted in a far harsher ride in exchange for minimal performance gains  — has been modified as well.
Inside  the cabin, Lexus has swapped out the mouse-like controller for a new trackpad.  It's better but can still be overly distracting to use while driving. The  display screen is also new. It's now a touchscreen, meaning you can avoid using  the trackpad by touching the various menus and buttons. Lexus also repositioned  the screen to be nearly 6 inches closer to the driver, so reaching the screen  doesn't require a stretch. Finally, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are also on  board this year as standard equipment. These changes go a long way toward  improving the RX 350's tech cred.
The  2020 Lexus RX 350 is more competitive than ever, with drastic quality-of-life  improvements that make it a more appealing buy than last year's model.  Previously an also-ran in the midsize luxury crossover segment, the RX has  graduated to become a respectable offering in the class. Though  we prefer the F Sport's more aggressive yet still comfortable sport seats, the base Lexus RX 350 is more well-rounded  and appeals to a broader set of buyers. The Navigation package is worth getting because it adds the sharp-looking  12.3-inch display, an upgraded audio system, and onboard navigation for when  your adventures take you to locales with spotty cellular service.",V6 cylinder ,140," 268 lb-ft @ 4,700 ",front wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

They were small cars that  lacked features and space. You bought one because you had to, not because you  wanted to. And though the Chevy Spark with its hatchback body style is no  Rolls-Royce or Mercedes-Benz competitor, it features modern infotainment  capabilities, excellent maneuverability and even better fuel economy. It makes  sense that the Spark features these traits since its country of origin, South  Korea, has lots of tight urban environments. 
Thanks  to its rear-vision camera and short overhangs (the parts of the car that stick  out beyond the wheels), the Spark is a cinch to parallel park and maneuver.  Plus, it features GM's Chevrolet Link 3 system, which provides for standard  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. This tech makes up for the fact  that there's no navigation or voice control, though it will pass commands directly  to your phone.
But  the Spark's small size has its drawbacks, too. Even against other subcompact  cars, rear-seat room and cargo space are on the small side. And though the  powertrain delivers good fuel economy, it's at the expense of brute force.  Other players in this space — such as the Kia Rio, Mitsubishi Mirage,  Toyota Yaris and Honda Fit — feature varying compromises of  performance, size and efficiency. But the Spark's even balance of all of these  factors is worth considering. Notably, the 2020 Chevrolet Spark is a featured vehicle in our Cheapest New Cars article. With  the Spark's cost of entry so low, most people will be able to afford to move up  a trim level and get more features.

Though now six years old, continual improvements have helped the Odyssey maintain its status as one of the best minivans on the market. The second-generation Honda Odyssey is most often recognized as the minivan benchmark, having thieved the crown from Chrysler shortly after its debut in 1999. Honda reliability, coupled with a cavernous interior and useful features like a fold-flat third-row seat and second-row captain's chairs that can slide together to serve as a bench are among the reasons the Odyssey has won every Edmunds.com minivan comparison test conducted since 1999.For 2004, however, the Honda faces revitalized competition in the form of the all-new Toyota Sienna and Nissan Quest. Though neither looks to be revolutionary, minivan shoppers would be wise to add them to their list of potential purchases. And even if you still decide on an Odyssey, keep in mind that this new competition could aid you in getting a better price on the Honda -- in years past, the high popularity of the Odyssey gave dealers the advantage when it came time for price negotiations. The 3.5-liter V6 produces a stout 240 horsepower and 242 pound-feet of torque. It's connected to a five-speed automatic transmission that puts power to the front wheels. This is one of the quickest minivans available, with 0-to-60 mph coming up in less than 8.0 seconds. It also posts an EPA mileage estimate of 18 city/25 highway. A minivan would not be complete without safety features, and the Odyssey comes with its share. All seven seats have headrests and three-point seatbelts, and each Odyssey comes with four-wheel antilock disc brakes and side airbags for front occupants. In government crash testing, the Odyssey has earned five stars, the best ranking possible, for both frontal and side-impact safety. The IIHS has also given the minivan a ""Good"" rating (the highest possible) for its performance in the 40-mph frontal offset crash test. Two relatively new safety features found on the new Nissan Quest and Toyota Sienna -- stability control and head-protecting side curtain airbags -- aren't available on the Odyssey. Sitting on a four-wheel independent suspension the Odyssey rides comfortably and keeps the driver in touch with the road. Combined with the Odyssey's wide track, the suspension contributes a nimble and stable feel. Body roll around corners is minimal, particularly for a vehicle of this size, and the suspension does a respectable job of smoothing over bumps. A key Odyssey feature continues to be its hideaway, or ""magic,"" third-row seat. With a minimum of effort and the use of just one set of hands, the rear seat can be folded out of sight and sit flush with the floor in a matter of seconds. A number of other manufacturers have copied this design, however, and the Sienna now offers a 60/40-split folding version that offers greater seating flexibility for larger families. The Odyssey's second-row seats are convertible and can be used as separate captain's chairs or as a bench. With the third-row seat lowered and the second-row seats removed, the Odyssey can fit up to 146 cubic feet of cargo, almost twice the amount of your average midsize SUV. There are two trim levels: LX and EX. The base LX model includes such standard fare as a height-adjustable driver seat, traction control, dual manual-sliding doors, power windows (including power rear-vent windows), power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, front and rear air conditioning and antilock brakes. Step up to the EX and enjoy features like dual power-sliding doors, automatic climate control, keyless remote entry, an eight-way power driver seat, alloy wheels, a CD player and steering wheel-mounted audio controls.

The interior has also been significantly upgraded, with a new steering wheel, switchgear, instrument cluster and materials. There are also some minor feature changes within equipment groups. As a traditional American full-size van, the 2008 GMC Savana (and its Chevy Express twin) is a capable people carrier for businesses and humongous families. Full-size vans like the 2008 GMC Savana are redesigned so infrequently, a redo date of 1996 is practically fresh. Having been around for more than four decades, GMC's full-size van lived through the 1970s, '80s and half of the '90s via sheet metal changes and updates to the running gear. It assumed today's shape 12 years ago and to celebrate the rebirth, the van's name was changed from Rally Wagon to Savana.A number of important under-the-skin changes took place for 2003, including a wider selection of V8 engines, the first-time availability of all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements -- all of which went a long way toward making the Savana safer and more capable than ever before. For 2008, the interior has been updated again with improved interior materials and switchgear.The 2008 GMC Savana still outpaces the even older Ford Econoline and certainly warrants consideration for those who need to ferry a small platoon (up to 15 people can ride in an Savana 3500) and require the cargo volume only a large van can provide. Naturally, these attributes are most often needed by small businesses and fleet operators. The European-designed and dramatically more modern Dodge Sprinter is pricier than the Savana, but with its much taller interior and better road manners, it makes a much better shuttle. The standard engine on Savana 1500 models is a 5.3-liter V8 making 301 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque. A 6.0-liter V8 rated at 323  and 373 lb-ft of torque is standard on 3500s. All 1500 models use a four-speed automatic that sends power to the rear wheels, while 3500s get a heavy-duty version of that transmission. An all-wheel-drive configuration is also available for the 1500. The maximum trailer-towing capacity on 1500 models is 6,300 pounds, while the heavy-duty 3500 can pull up to 7,600 pounds when properly equipped. All models have antilock disc brakes, stability control and side curtain airbags (for the first three rows) as standard equipment. In frontal-impact crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2008 GMC Savana scored five stars (the highest possible). A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2008 GMC Savana respectable ride and handling characteristics. Although GMC's van is still far from nimble, it fares reasonably well in day-to-day driving. And with a pair of V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers come easily, even when you're hauling a heavy load of passengers and cargo. The Savana's interior is built for pure functionality, and while it may not be pretty, it gets the job done. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but the footwells remain as cramped as ever. Unlike the Dodge Sprinter, there is no tall roof option that allows a normal-sized person to walk upright in this full-size GMC van. Savana buyers can opt for 60/40-split driver-side doors for easier passenger access to the rear seats. The standard configuration seats 12, with eight- or 15-passenger arrangements also available, depending on which model you choose. The standard-wheelbase (135-inch) 2008 GMC Savana full-size van comes in half-ton (1500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations. The extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available only on the 3500. There are two trim levels: LS and LT. LS models are geared toward fleet service, so standard equipment is limited to air-conditioning, an AM/FM stereo and a theft-deterrent system. The more livable LT models include auxiliary rear air-conditioning and heating, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and keyless entry. Optional equipment includes power driver and front passenger seats, alloy wheels and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer.",V8 cylinder ,295," 325 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Although it's no longer the biggest sport-ute on the block, the all new Yukon XL is easily the best combination of size, power and comfort in a full-size SUV. The 2000 Yukon XL continues to build on GMC's desire to compete in the luxury SUV market. Just a few inches longer than its brother, the non-XL Yukon, this former Suburban -- based on a new GM platform first seen as the foundation of the Chevy Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups -- has the power, handling and indulgences to appeal to upscale SUV buyers. This is a complete overhaul, with the Yukon XL leaving its Chevy roots behind and stepping forward as a full GMC nameplate.Available in a light-duty 1500 model and a heavy-duty 2500, the 2000 Yukon XL's contours have been reshaped to appear more muscular, foreshadowing the upgrades under the hood. The standard engine on all 1500 series models is the 4.8-liter Vortec V8, with 275 horsepower at 5,200 rpm. Optional on the 1500 and standard on 2500s is a 5.3-liter Vortec V8 engine, offering 285 horsepower at 5,200 rpm, 30 more horsepower than the larger 5700 Vortec it replaces. The standard engine on 2500s with a Gross Vehicle Weight rating over 7,200 lbs is the 6.0-liter Vortec V8, offering 300 horsepower at 4,800 rpm. All engines drive a four-speed automatic transmission, improved to increase oil life and to operate at lower temperatures than previous transmissions.The towing capabilities of this GMC have been increased as well. The 5.3-liter and 6.0-liter engines show maximum trailer capacities of 9,000 and 10,500 pounds, respectively. A 23 percent stiffer body and chassis, independent front torsion bar suspension and rear self-leveling, five-link coil-spring underpinnings make for fewer squeaks and rattles and better handling. The three-quarter ton suspension uses multileaf springs and a semifloating rear axle.The overall driving experience has been heightened with the aid of a wider track and shorter turning diameters on both the two- and four-wheel-drive versions and standard variable-effort power steering system. This last feature adapts the required steering effort to the vehicle speed, providing more responsive feel at highway speeds, but reduced effort for parking maneuvers.Interior space has been increased, with more room all around. With three rows of seats, the XL can carry nine passengers. Either of the halves of the third-row seat can be folded or removed for greater cargo capacity. With the second- and third-row seats removed, you can drop a 4x8 sheet of plywood on the floor with the rear doors closed, due in part to the spare being moved under the cargo body. However, the base models aren't as nicely equipped on the inside, with plenty of plastic molding. To get the nice stuff, you have to upgrade to SLT trim. The Yukon XL still carries much of its former Suburban self, but this redesign has made it a better vehicle. There are still a few shortcomings, but with the optional upgrades, the powerful engine choices and a better driving feel it's worth a look-see.",V8 cylinder ,195," 325 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Audi,audi a5,2021,audi a5 2021,"['Understated and classy interior', 'Strong overall performance', 'Plenty of standard and optional tech features']",['Limited interior storage'],4.7,"In  an automotive landscape dominated by the SUV and all of its various  subdivisions, the two-door coupe feels like an endangered species. Only a  handful of automakers, mostly European, offer a coupe in their lineup, and most  hedge their bets with a complementary four-door model built in the sleek shape  of a sport coupe. Among the standouts in this shrinking class is the 2021 Audi  A5. 
Built  on the same foundation as the A4 sedan, the A5 trades four-door utility for  large measures of style. Its sweeping roofline, larger wheels and sculpted rear  panels make it one of the sharpest-looking coupes on the road today. The A5 is  also available as a convertible and, yes, a four-door hatchback known as the  Sportback.
The  A5 interior features impeccable interior design and infotainment based around a  10-inch high-resolution display. The A5 even now offers wireless functionality  for Apple CarPlay smartphone integration. Android Auto users are still out of  luck for wireless support, although a USB cable connection comes standard.
Other  A5 changes in 2021 include more horsepower (up 13 horsepower) thanks to a light  electric-assist motor that shoulders certain low-intensity tasks typically  handled by the engine. Key tech features also filter down one trim level, with  lane keeping assist and a surround-view camera now standard on the Premium  Plus, for example.
For  2021, the A5 Sportback variant offers a second option, with less horsepower at  a lower cost. It's the most affordable entry point into the A5 lineup  — and arguably the most useful with its four doors and 40/20/40-split  folding rear seat. The coupe and convertible only offer 50/50-split folding  seats.
We  think the A5 is a smart pick for a small luxury coupe or convertible even  against the likes of the BMW 4 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The A5  Sportback version is similarly appealing. If the luxury sport coupe is indeed  seeing its final days, the A5 remains one of its strongest survivors. The Premium Plus hits the sweet spot.  You get all the goodness of the base Premium trim, along with extras including  upgraded headlights, heated steering wheel and additional leather interior  trim. Premium Plus also adds adaptive cruise control and parking sensors among  other desirable driver aids.",Inline 4 cylinder ,155, 236 lb-ft ,front wheel drive , 7-speed automated manual

The SOHC V6 is standard on all models, and the 4.0-liter OHV V6 and manual transmission are no longer available. Additional child safety-seat tether anchors have been added to the second-row seats. In spite of its ubiquity, the dated 2001 Ford Explorer can't compete with the other excellent midsize SUVs available. Since its introduction in 1990 as a 1991 model, the Ford Explorer has resided at the top of the sport-utility sales heap. This is totally understandable, as the Explorer combines style, comfort and room in a go-anywhere package. The modern-day Country Squire, some have called it, after the segment-leading station wagon of the 1960s. The Explorer's sales success, of course, has to do with America's big appetite for SUVs. But it's also a compliment to Ford, as the Explorer was designed to appeal to the widest range of people possible.While the 2001 Explorer Sport features new sheetmetal and minor suspension changes, the four-door Explorer remains virtually identical to last year's model. There are four trim levels available: XLS, XLT, Eddie Bauer and Limited. The majority of Explorers sold are XLTs. If you want your Explorer to be as special as possible, step up to the Eddie Bauer or Limited. These models come standard with added luxury feature content like leather seats, automatic climate control and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Optional equipment worth considering includes side airbags, a moonroof, rear load leveling and a reverse sensing system.All models feature an organically sweeping dashboard housing radio controls that can be operated without a magnifying glass. Materials in the Explorer look and feel better than many other SUVs. Rear-seat comfort is excellent, and entry/exit is easy with the optional running boards attached. Fold the rear seats down, and the Explorer will offer 80 cubic feet of cargo.For 2001, the 4.0-liter SOHC V6 is standard on every model. It generates 205 horsepower at 5,250 rpm, with 240 pound-feet of peak torque at 3,250 rpm. A five-speed automatic is the only transmission offered on this engine. Power delivery is acceptable with the V6, but if you're planning on heavy towing, you might want to order the optional 5.0-liter V8. It has more torque than the V6, but the downside is worse fuel mileage. An automatic four-wheel-drive system is available with both engines.Explorers retain a distinctly trucklike character, which could be a bonus or a demerit. They're tough and solid, but the suspension manages to be floaty and wallowy on dips, harsh on bumps, and easily unsettled by rumpled pavement. Cornering causes lots of body lean. The brakes are quite good, however, and the steering is quick and responsive for an SUV.The Explorer's basic underpinnings and body structure date back 10 years, when it was first introduced, and it's showing its age. While the Explorer provides a comfortable cabin and excellent safety ratings, its harsh ride and less-than-stellar handling and performance behoove us to tell you that a redesigned version will debut early next year as a 2002 model. If you're set on buying an Explorer, we'd recommend that you wait a bit for the new and improved version.",V6 cylinder ,146," 240 lb-ft @ 3,250 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed automatic

It's based on Audi's A6 midsize sedan but it  has a sleeker profile and a rear hatchback for greater cargo-carrying  versatility.

The Toyota Corolla has been through many iterations since it was first introduced in 1968.  Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan.  The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the second best selling vehicle in  history. Totally redesigned, the new Toyota Corolla is set to increase its global sales record and become the  standard against which all small cars will be compared.  Why?  Because there is nothing like it, other than the re-badged Chevrolet Prizm, that carries this level of refinement and convenience in the sub-$20,000 price class. We think that the most exciting change to the Corolla occurs under the car's hood.  Nestled between the grille and the firewall is a 1.8-liter all-aluminum DOHC four-cylinder engine that cranks out 120 horsepower and 122 foot-pounds of torque.  This high-revving engine not only provides the Corolla with more power than last year's motor, it does so while being 10 percent more fuel-efficient.  When glued to a  five-speed manual transmission, this engine will reward drivers with 31 mpg in the city and 38 mpg on the freeway. Equally impressive is Toyota's newfound commitment to safety.  In 1998 all Corollas are available with four-wheel antilock brakes and side-impact airbags.  You heard that right, Toyota's bargain-priced Corolla is the cheapest car that driver's concerned about their safety can outfit with seat-mounted side airbags.   Those with kids will be happy to know that CE and LE models can be ordered with an integrated child seat.   Also new in 1998 is the car's body.  We think the new look is attractive, but this little sedan  follows typical Toyota policy and does nothing that will visually offend.  This unfortunately means that  there is nothing visually exciting about the car, either.  Aesthetics aside, the Corolla's new shape does a good job of reducing the cars NVH levels, thanks to flush-mounted side windows and sound-deadening techniques borrowed from the Lexus magicians.  Also improved by the new body is the Corolla's torsional rigidity, an important factor in making this car more fun to drive than its predecessor. Toyota is on a roll, offering up fine products faster than an Amway salesman at a flea market.  The Corolla is sure to be a hit with the just-starting-out crowd as well as empty nesters that simply don't need a large sedan anymore.  Levels of safety and refinement usually don't come this cheap.  We predict that the Corolla will steal plenty of sales from the Honda Civic and Nissan Altima.",Inline 4 cylinder ,133," 122 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

It has room inside for five adults, attractive yet conservative styling, exceptional pep from an available 24-valve 3.0-liter V6, and a price that doesn't break the bank so long as options are kept to a minimum.Toyota is going after the number-one sales spot with vigor.  The Camry is larger and more powerful than last year, but costs less money.  Coupe and wagon models have been dropped from the lineup, and consumers can opt for the V6 engine on base CE models for the first time.  Antilock brakes are standard on all but the most basic Camrys, and an integrated child-safety seat is optional across the board.  Buyers of V6 models can order traction control for inclement weather.The new Camry can be equipped for rugged family life, or plush luxury touring.  Options on higher-grade LE and XLE models include a premium sound system, leather interior trim, and a power moonroof.  With the V6 engine, the Camry accelerates strongly.  Braking is swift and sure with the antilock system, and Camry hangs on well in corners despite rather meek all-season radials.Inside, a two-inch increase in wheelbase has allowed designers to maximize space, creating a larger Camry than ever.  Controls and gauges are laid-out nicely in a more flowing dashboard than the previous car boasted.  Camry CE sticks with a fixed-mast stereo antenna, but LE and XLE get an in-glass antenna, which reduces wind noise.  Storage areas have been increased also, and a tissue holder is built into the center console.  Front cupholders accommodate 20-ounce bottles of your favorite beverage.Is the Camry the perfect family conveyance?  Not out of the box, but it's close.

The 2020 Chevrolet Malibu rides well on the highway and has a  roomy cabin fitted with an easy-to-use infotainment system. It is, at its core,  a fundamentally solid midsize sedan. However, it also happens to be surrounded  by a deep class of rival sedans that outdo it in a few areas.  
Like  its competitors, the Malibu can be equipped with different powertrains. There  are two turbocharged four-cylinder engine options: a base 1.5-liter and a  2.0-liter engine. We like the zesty 2.0-liter engine, but the base 1.5-liter  engine — the one most commonly found at dealer lots — is  sluggish.
On  the inside, there's roomy seating up front. But there's less rear legroom  compared to what you'll find in some other top sedans, and the overall cabin  aesthetic is a bit underwhelming. The report on the infotainment system is  mixed, too. GM's Chevrolet Link 3 system features useful smartphone integration  and big graphics, but its standard display looks lower-res than the  competition. 
Overall,  the Malibu is an acceptable choice, especially if you manage to get a great  deal or are interested in the hybrid version. But we also suggest shopping some  of the other Edmunds' top-rated sedans such as the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata  and Mazda 6. We  used to recommend the hybrid as it provided the best combination of features,  performance and value. But since Chevrolet discontinued it this year, the next  best choice is the Premier.

Otherwise, Hyundai's bargain-basement car soldiers on to 2002 with no changes in store. In base hatchback form, this is America's least expensive car. While we might steer our friends toward a slightly used Japanese car, the Accent's great warranty and solid build quality could make it a satisfying choice for the determined new-car buyer. Hyundai is on a mission to reinvent itself in the minds of the American car-buying public. After a rocky period in the '80s that had people saying, ""Hyundais sure are inexpensive ... and you get what you pay for,"" the company has unleashed several winners in a row. The Elantra offers impressive power and sophistication for its price, the Sonata is a roomy and well-built midsize sedan that undercuts competitors by thousands, and the Santa Fe is larger than most mini-utes. Additionally, all Hyundais come with an impressive 10-year/100,000-mile drivetrain warranty, helping instill peace in the consumer's mind. The entry-level Accent is no exception to Hyundai's rule. Three versions are available. The base L and midlevel GS come in hatchback format, while the highline GL model is available only as a sedan. The base engine on L models is a 1.5-liter SOHC four-cylinder making 89 horsepower. A larger 103-horsepower 1.6-liter is optional on L and standard on GS and GL models. This DOHC design offers more power and increased fuel economy over the standard engine. An available four-speed automatic performs admirably, but can only be added to the GS or the GL.Under the Accent's attractively creased bodywork sits a MacPherson strut independent front and a dual-link rear suspension. Stabilizer bars at both ends do a poor job of controlling body lean, and skinny 13-inch wheels and tires do little to inspire confidence in Accent's handling. But the use of hydraulic engine mounting means reduced noise, vibration and harshness. Safety features include depowered airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners. Unfortunately, ABS for the front disc/rear drum braking system is not even available as an option.Interiors feature a modern instrument pod and a center stack with straightforward climate and radio controls. Rear seat heating and ventilation ducts help keep backseat riders comfortable, and the use of noise-reduction material in the A- and B-pillars attempts to quiet the ride. The driver seat features adjustments for height and rake, as well as fore and aft settings. Oh, and a nifty fold-down armrest is standard.Standard equipment includes a cassette player, rear defroster, trip odometer and power steering. Step up to the GS or GL, and you'll receive air conditioning (optional for the L), upgraded carpeting, a digital clock, a tachometer, adjustable lumbar support for the driver, a 60/40 folding rear seat, a passenger visor vanity mirror and tinted glass. Upgraded trims also open the door to the few factory options that are available, such as power front windows, power exterior mirrors and a CD player. Any Accents can be had with carpeted floor mats, a rear spoiler, a center armrest, mudguards and a cargo net for the trunk.Hyundai has made great strides with regard to quality in the last few years and is gaining respect for its products. In the subcompact world, the Accent has plenty to offer buyers who must have that new-car smell and new-car warranty. But at a welterweight 2,280 pounds, this smallest Hyundai doesn't offer much crash protection from the hulking SUVs and pickups on the roads. Our advice?

Literally, the automaker had purged five exterior colors  from the 2023 BMW X7 lineup but added five new ones (two blues and three grays,  if you were wondering). But BMW marks the first-generation X7's midway point  figuratively with a fresh dose of more power for its six-cylinder engine, a  rebuilt V8 engine (yet with the same power as before), a significant in-car  tech overhaul, and a subtle update to the X7's otherwise bold face. A new electrical assist system is added to both of the X7's six- and eight-cylinder engines, although the six-cylinder benefits most. It gains 40 horsepower for a total of 375  and about 15% more low-end torque. The V8 is built from entirely new components, according to BMW, yet makes the same power as the outgoing engine. At 523 , it feels like plenty, though the six-cylinder engine is no slouch either. The new X7 also features a sophisticated air suspension and anti-roll functions that give it a sure-footedness uncommon in its class. That helps it handle better than most rivals, with more controlled body motions around corners. Up  front, the X7 features restyled headlights, with LED intensity packed into a  narrower real estate. The oversized kidney grille remains a love-it-or-leave-it  proposition, but assuming you love it, now you have the option to illuminate it  with multiple tiny LED accents. Inside the cabin, two separate high-definition  dash displays seamlessly join into one expansive curved widescreen,  incorporating both digital driver instruments and the X7's infotainment nerve  center. It's a truly impressive unit, among the best in the business, and its  curvature encourages the passenger to take control of functions such as  navigation that might otherwise distract a driver.The  cumulative changes give the X7 an edge in a competitive class of large luxury  SUVs. We're still partial to the X7's main rival, the Mercedes-Benz GLS since  it better embodies the space and luxury most buyers seek. And others like the  Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade outmatch the X7 in cargo space and  towing capacity. But if you prefer a big SUV that can still handle corners at  high speed, the refreshed 2023 X7 is one of your best bets. The  M60i offers remarkable performance, with a rowdy V8 that moves the big SUV with  total authority and sings a glorious song along the way. But it's a commitment,  both in the price on the contract and at the pump. We'd stick with the  well-equipped xDrive40i. The  additional power for this year's six-cylinder makes it more potent, and you can  add many of the M60i's features as options.

Unlike the Suburban, which may have difficulty fitting into a standard garage, the Expedition can be handled with ease in most parking maneuvers.  The Expedition also has the best payload and towing capacity in its class:  2,000-lbs. and 8000-lbs., respectively.On the road the Expedition is well mannered.  It's obvious that this is not a car, but compared to the vehicle it replaces the Expedition rides like a limousine.  Interior ergonomics are first rate and will be familiar to anyone who has spent time in the new F-150.  From the front seat forward the Expedition is nearly identical to the new pickup.  That's a good thing; we love the cab of the 1997 F-150 with its easy-to-use climate and stereo controls, steering wheel mounted cruise control, plenty of cupholders and great storage space.   Ford has put a lot of time and money into making this truck the next sales leader in their already dominant light-truck lineup.  We came away impressed and think you will too.  The Expedition comes standard with dual airbags, a first in this segment, antilock brakes, and fold-flat second row seats; features that we feel are important in this increasingly competitive segment.  Our few gripes stem from the powertrain.  After driving a few Vortec powered Suburbans this year, we've become spoiled by the GM engine's gobs of torque and horsepower.  The Expedition's power output won't be confused with a Geo Tracker, but it did leave us wondering if we could squeeze one of GM's 5.7-liter powerhouses into the engine bay.  One option that we think everyone should investigate is the lighted running boards.  The Expedition towers above the ground, and entering and exiting this truck will take its toll on most passengers after a few days.We think that the Expedition will be turning up in our neighborhood parking lots and driveways very soon.  If you're thinking of buying a full-size SUV in the near future, you owe it to yourself to take a look at this truck.",V8 cylinder ,172," 290 lb-ft @ 3,250 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Chevrolet,chevrolet spark,2018,chevrolet spark 2018,"['Impressive number of features at an affordable price', 'Offers many optional high-tech features', 'High fuel economy', 'Easy to park in tight spaces']","['Acceleration is slow, both for the class and in general', 'Not much rear legroom and cargo capacity']",3.9,"The 2018 Chevrolet Spark is unchanged. Subcompacts appeal to the practical and  budget-conscience. They're inexpensive, frugal and, most important for city  dwellers, easy to park. The 2018 Chevrolet Spark has all those traits but also  adds a healthy list of standard and optional features to the mix.  Even  in its most basic LS trim, the Spark comes with modern conveniences that rival  those on bigger and more expensive cars. A fold-down rear bench seat increases  functionality, as does its standard smartphone integration with Android Auto and  Apple CarPlay. It's also nimble around turns yet comfortable enough for longer  trips.But  to be frugal, efficient and small means some aspects must be compromised. For  the Spark, that's in its acceleration — which is slow even for this  class of car — and total usable cargo space. There's very little room  behind the rear seats. And while the rear seats are comfortable, taller adults  may brush their heads up against the roof. Generally,  though, you should be pleased with Chevy's Spark if you're looking for  affordable urban-oriented transportation. With its composed ride, affordable price, and lengthy list of standard equipment, the 2018 Chevrolet Spark punches above its weight. While it's not the quickest-accelerating subcompact, this hatchback is easy to drive in cities and even easier to park. Edmunds has not driven any current version of the 2018 Chevrolet Spark, but we have limited experience with similar previous versions. The following is our first take on what's significant about it and what you can expect. The Spark's small four-cylinder engine is best suited for around-town use. A CVT automatic-equipped Spark takes over 11 seconds to accelerate to 60 mph from a stop, so highway on-ramps require some planning. Surprisingly, the Spark is agile around town and delivers a well-mannered ride overall. While it's noisy, it compares favorably with other cars in the class. Seating position is upright, with minimal lateral support. The rear seats are best suited to smaller passengers. Yes, it's small, but the layout is functional. The high roofline gives it decent room, access and visibility, too. Cargo space is tight with four aboard, but it's plentiful with the rear seat folded. There's minimal cargo room with the rear seat in use, but fold it down and there's more than enough storage for the sorts of local errands that suit this subcompact hatchback. The MyLink infotainment system adds to the Spark's modern vibe. The menus are intuitive, and the graphics are sharp. The touchscreen supports multi-gesture control and provides Apple CarPlay and Android Auto interface. The standard OnStar 4G LTE service provides advanced connectivity options. Thanks  to its low price, the Spark undercuts its competitors by thousands of dollars  when new, even in its top-spec trim. Still, there's something to be said about  keeping all the bells and whistles out of your subcompact, so we'd split the  difference and go for the 1LT, which  adds much-needed features such as power windows and locks and cruise control. The  Spark LS comes with a rearview  camera, a 7-inch touchscreen, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability,  Bluetooth and USB connectivity, a four-speaker audio system, air conditioning,  and Chevrolet's OnStar communications system that includes a 4G LTE in-car  Wi-Fi hotspot.The 1LT adds 15-inch alloy wheels, power  accessories (windows, mirrors and door locks), cruise control, remote keyless  entry, foglights, and a six-speaker audio system.From  here, the Activ adds simulated  leather seating surfaces, heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel,  roof rails, special 15-inch wheels and bodywork, and a raised suspension that  provides 0.4 inch of additional ground clearance.Alternately,  go for the 2LT. Compared to the 1LT,  it adds rear parking sensors,  simulated seating surfaces, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, push-button  start, an upgraded driver information display, heated front seats, and chrome  door handles and trim.A  sunroof is optional for the 1LT and 2LT trims. For the 2LT only, you can get a  Driver Confidence package that adds forward collision warning and lane departure  warning systems.",Inline 4 cylinder ,375," 94 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Audi,audi a8,2000,audi a8 2000,"['Lightweight aluminum body, powerful engine, sumptuous luxury, all-wheel drive.']","['Price paid for advanced technology, tight rear-seat accommodations, overly soft suspension.']",4.8,"Updated styling in the form of a revised grille, enlarged headlights, added chrome and aluminum trim and reshaped bumpers provides a subtle new look. Inside, new interior surfaces and standard Valcona leather intensify an already richly appointed cabin. Revised switchgear makes it easier to pilot the A8, and a new navigation system is available. A new 4.2-liter, 40-valve V8 resides under the hood, and aluminum suspension components reduce unsprung weight and enhance handling. A long wheelbase version (A8L) is now available for increased comfort of rear passengers, and comes standard with an electronic stability control system and navigation system. While the A8 and A8 L aren't top performers in the super-luxury sedan segment, their well-appointed cabins and all-wheel drive make them feasible alternatives to offerings from BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. Introduced in 1997, he A8 is aging gracefully. Sporting senior A4 styling, sumptuous interior appointments, and the revolutionary Audi Space Frame (ASF), the A8 is lighter, tighter and more responsive than many other super-luxury competitors. But to remain competitive, Audi has subtly updated its flagship sedan with numerous improvements for 2000. The highly regarded ASF remains intact this year. Employing lightweight aluminum-alloy construction, ASF is designed to provide superior structural rigidity, improved handling and responsiveness, better fuel efficiency and easier recycling. Audi furthers the use of aluminum in the A8 for 2000 by adding suspension components constructed of the stuff to reduce unsprung weight and improve responsiveness and handling. Improvements in ride comfort are also on tap for 2000. Two models are available for 2000. The A8 4.2 Quattro, which has all-wheel drive, is powered by a new 310-horsepower, 4.2-liter V8 engine under the hood. Sporting 40-valves, this new V8 makes peak power between 3,000 and 4,000 rpm. It's smoother, more responsive, and more fuel-efficient than last year's motor. Then there's the A8 L, which adds five inches to the standard A8's wheelbase, yielding increased legroom for rear passengers. The safety of your passengers is a priority in the A8. This year, Audi adds its Sideguard head airbag system to the A8. Sideguard consists of inflatable curtain airbags installed in the headliner along each side of the car, which cover the windows in the event of an accident. These airbags, remain inflated for five seconds to protect the head in case the vehicle rolls over. Audi's vaunted quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard. Additionally, Electronic Differential Locking (EDL) provides low-speed traction control operating through the standard ABS. Optional on the A8 and standard on the L is the Electronic Stability Program (ESP), which is designed to make the car easier to control near the limits of adhesion. Inside, drivers will find a revised interior slathered in real wood and new-for-2000 Valcona leather upholstery. Instrumentation has also been updated for 2000, and it's superbly user-friendly. A navigation system is standard on the L and optional on the A8, eschewing the traditional in-dash screen in favor of a more subdued readout that shares space with the information center in the gauge cluster. Despite its rather expensive price tag, the A8's technological advances and long list of standard equipment should prove desirable enough to continue bringing BMW, Lexus and Benz intenders into Audi showrooms.",V8 cylinder ,130," 302 lb-ft @ 3,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed automatic

Air conditioning is now standard on all trim levels along with extendable sunshade visors and improved base model radios. Chevrolet makes a pretty good pick-'em-up if powerful engines are your thing. But they've got a ways to go to match the Ford F-250 Super Duty when it comes to the quality of the materials and overall craftsmanship. Debuting last year with an all-new design, Chevrolet's 2500HD adds a whole new level of power and capability to the already sturdy 2500. Although it does share some engine and drivetrain components with the standard 2500, these heavy-duty models feature additional hardware that allows them to boast some of the highest tow ratings of any truck on the market.No heavy-duty pickup would be worth a lick without a powerful drivetrain, and the 2500HD doesn't disappoint. The base engine is a 6.0-liter Vortec V8 rated at 300 horsepower and 360 pound-feet of torque, easily out-muscling Ford's 5.4-liter Triton V8 (260, 350 lb-ft) and Dodge's 5.9-liter V8 (245, 345 lb-ft). If that's not enough grunt under the hood, Chevrolet offers two even more powerful options: an 8.1-liter Vortec V8 and the 6.6-liter Duramax turbodiesel. The Vortec 8100 boasts an impressive 340  and 455 lb-ft of torque, higher numbers than even its competitor's V10s can muster. The Duramax diesel also generates impressive power with 300  and 520 lb-ft of torque. All that power won't do much unless there's a sturdy transmission behind it to put it to the ground. All 6.0-liter-equipped 2500s come with the New Venture 4500 five-speed as standard equipment, with the 4L80-E four-speed automatic as the only available option. All Silverados equipped with either the Vortec 8100 or Duramax turbodiesel come standard with a ZF six-speed manual featuring fully synchronized gears, synthetic gear oil and a two-piece aluminum case designed for maximum durability. Optional on the big engines is an Allison 1000 five-speed overdrive automatic. This transmission uses electronic control for precisely timed shifts and will automatically downshift on grades to provide engine braking. It's also the first automatic transmission to feature Power Take-Off (PTO) capability, delivering up to 250 lb-ft of continuous torque to worksite equipment. Supporting all this heavy-duty hardware is a fully independent torsion bar suspension in front and a semi-floating solid axle in the rear with two-stage leaf springs. Four -wheel disc brakes with ABS and GM's Hydro-Boost brake proportioning system are standard on all models. Standard tires are E-load range 245/75R16s mounted on eight-lug steel wheels. Maximum towing capacity for 6.0-liter-equipped Silverados is 10,400 pounds while Vortec 8100 and Duramax diesel-equipped models can tow up to 12,000 pounds on a standard trailer. The use of a fifth-wheel or ""gooseneck"" ups the maximum weight rating to 15,800 pounds.All Silverados are available in three different trim levels: base, LS and LT. Base models come standard with a 40/20/40 split bench seat, air conditioning, a tilt steering wheel, 17 function driver message center and deep tinted glass. Mid-grade LS models add power windows and door locks, remote keyless entry, an AM/FM/CD stereo, cruise control and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Top-of-the-line LTs come with power heated leather seats, the OnStar communications system, a self-dimming rearview mirror with a built-in compass and power heated exterior mirrors. With big, comfortable seats and a solid ergonomic design, all Silverados sport roomy cabins with plenty of head, leg and hip room. Extended-cab models have a surprising amount of space for rear-seat passengers and clamshell rear doors on both sides for easy access. While we don't think the evolutionary styling of the GM's heavy-duty pickups carries the brute appeal of a Ford Super Duty or the big-nosed 3500-series Dodge, we do know that they will beat them when it comes to good ol' pullin' and haulin.' Regardless of what configuration you choose, Chevrolet's 2500HD provides all the power and capability you'll ever need along with a comfortable interior and a smooth ride.",V8 cylinder ,240," 360 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Acura,acura rdx,2017,acura rdx 2017,,"['Technology interface can be distracting to use, especially the optional dual-screen system', ""High-tech safety features and adaptive cruise control don't work as well as some rival systems"", 'Cabin lacks overtly luxurious look and feel']",4.3,"The Acura RDX essentially carries over unchanged for 2017. There are many reason why the Acura RDX is one of our top  picks in the segment. It's a well-made, well-equipped compact SUV that is a  clear, premium step up from the Honda CR-Vs of this world. Its value is  undeniable and a must-drive for sensible sorts whose left side of the brain is  more influential than the right.  Chief among the RDX's virtues are space and value for your  money. Let's start with the first. Although a ""compact"" SUV, the RDX  has plenty of family-friendly space -- so much so that you could almost  consider it an alternative to midsize SUVs like the Lexus RX 350. Should you  need a backseat big enough to affix a rear-facing baby seat, or conversely, a  pair of growing teenagers, the RDX is better suited to the task than most other  vehicles in the segment. Cargo capacity is also generous, both in terms of its  on-paper measurements and real-world practicality.  As for value for your money, a fully loaded RDX with the  Advance package and all-wheel drive is barely more expensive than the most basic  BMW X3, Jaguar F-Pace or Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class. Sure, there are some areas in  which those are superior to the RDX, but if you're looking to get the most  equipment for your money while still getting a premium badge and a higher  degree of quality, this Acura could definitely be a better way to go. Notably, we picked the Acura RDX as one of Edmunds' Best Used SUVs and Best Used Luxury SUVs for 2017.  The RDX got a face-lift  last year, so changes for 2017 are restricted to a pair of new color choices. If a small, luxury SUV is on your shopping list, you should consider the 2017 Acura RDX. This stylish Acura is one of our favorites thanks to its fuel-efficient, yet powerful V6, comfortable interior and long list of standard features. Read on to find out why the RDX could be a good fit for you. The 2017 Acura RDX is a compact luxury SUV that seats five  people. There is a single trim level available with three optional packages  (AcuraWatch Plus, Technology and Advance). Front-wheel drive is standard and  all-wheel drive is optional. Standard features are plentiful. They include 18-inch  wheels, a rearview camera, automatic LED headlights, cruise control, rear  privacy glass, keyless ignition and entry, a power liftgate, a sunroof,  dual-zone automatic climate control, heated power front seats (eight-way  driver, four-way passenger), leatherette (premium vinyl) upholstery, a  leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an auto-dimming mirror,  Bluetooth phone and audio, and a seven-speaker sound system with satellite  radio, Pandora Internet radio control (streams from smartphone), an auxiliary  audio jack, a USB port and a media player interface.  The Acura RDX is the value  champ in the segment, boasting more equipment and space for your dollar than  anything else. The AcuraWatch Plus package adds a forward collision warning  and automatic braking system, a lane-departure warning and keeping system,  adaptive cruise control and a color trip computer display. The Technology package adds blind-spot and rear  cross-traffic warning systems, a navigation system, traffic information,  GPS-linked climate control, leather upholstery, an eight-way power passenger  seat, smartphone apps, HD radio, Aha Internet radio capability and a 10-speaker  Acura/ELS sound system. The Advance package includes all of the above extras plus  front and rear parking sensors, automatic wipers, foglights, auto-dimming side  mirrors, remote ignition and ventilated front seats. There are no other options. performance & mpg The 2017 Acura RDX is only available with a 3.5-liter V6  engine good for 279 horsepower and 252 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed  automatic transmission and front-wheel drive are standard, but all-wheel drive  is optional. In Edmunds acceleration testing, an all-wheel-drive RDX went  from zero to 60 mph in 6.5 seconds, making it one of the quickest SUVs in the  segment. Despite it have a V6 engine in a segment where turbocharged  four-cylinders are prevalent, the RDX still returns class-average fuel economy.  The EPA estimates that it will return 23 mpg combined  (20 city/28 highway) with front-wheel drive and 22 mpg (19/27) with all-wheel  drive. We managed a respectable 24.9 mpg on the 116-mile Edmunds evaluation  route.  The RDX is handsome, but  not overly flashy like some of its competitors. safety The 2017 Acura RDX comes standard with antilock brakes,  stability and traction control, front side airbags, side curtain airbags,  active front head restraints and a rearview camera. Optional active safety equipment includes forward collision  warning, forward collision mitigation with automatic braking, a blind spot  monitor, lane-departure warning and lane-departure intervention. Though these  systems on paper sound similar to those offered by rivals, in practice we found  them to set off the collision alarm in instances when a collision is clearly  not imminent. Its adaptive cruise control system is also too quick to slam on  the brakes and too slow to get back up to speed. In Edmunds brake testing, an all-wheel-drive 2016 RDX came  to a stop from 60 mph in 122 feet, which is about average for this class. The government gave the RDX a top score of five stars for total crash protection, with five  stars for total front impact safety and five stars for side-impact safety. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the RDX its highest possible score of ""Good"" in the moderate-overlap  frontal-offset, side-impact, roof-strength and head restraints and seats  (whiplash protection) tests.  Backseat space is among  the most generous in the segment. interior The 2017 Acura RDX's cabin is a pleasant place to be, as it  feels spacious and boasts solid construction. Base models get a dial controller on the center stack plus  conventional sound system buttons. That setup works fine, though the control  knob in the middle of the dash is less intuitive to use than some rival  console-mounted controllers. Unfortunately, the base setup might actually be  preferable to the upgraded split-screen interface that comes standard with the  Technology package -- operating the touchscreen's virtual buttons is a more  distracting and often slower process, and the way the system divides  information between the two screens can be confusing. On the upside, the front seats are as firm and supportive as  those in the best European models, while the backseat offers more legroom than  most competitors, making it easy for a pair of 6-footers to sit comfortably in  both rows. One notable ingredient here is the elevated height of the rear  bench, which affords both excellent thigh support and a commanding outward  view, while still leaving ample headroom. There's also enough width for three  adults to share the space during short trips. The 2017 RDX's 26.1 cubic feet of storage behind the rear  seats is about the same as most rivals, but folding down the rear seats (via a  pair of nifty release handles on the cargo bay walls) opens up 61.3 cubic feet  of capacity. That makes it one of the most spacious in the segment, though in  general, this segment considerably trails their non-luxury counterparts in this  regard: the Honda CR-V, for instance.  The cargo area is wider  than that of many rivals and generally more useful. driving A turbocharged four-cylinder is increasingly the engine of  choice for small luxury crossovers these days, but the V6 in the 2017 Acura RDX  is so good that you might just wonder what all the fuss is about. Step on the  gas pedal and the RDX scoots ahead quickly and quietly, though there's also a  nice V6 snarl at high that sounds better than a lot of those four-cylinder  engines. The six-speed automatic transmission is also a bit unusual in this era  of eight- and nine-speed automatics, but it generally responds to your inputs  with smooth and timely shifts. Though it's not quite as sporty as some rivals, the RDX  still changes direction with poise and confidence. Its steering feels light but  precise, and overall handling is composed and secure when driving through turns. On the open highway, the  RDX boasts low levels of road and wind noise, with an impressively comfortable  ride. Indeed, with its luxurious yet responsive character and standard V6  power, the RDX isn't just a top compact crossover. It can also be viewed as a  more affordable alternative to midsize models like the Lexus RX. We recommend getting a loaded RDX with the  Advance package. It doesn't cost much more than the base version of rivals  like the BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class, yet it includes high-end features  like the AcuraWatch safety system that provides a safety net most shoppers will  benefit from.",V6 cylinder ,401," 252 lb-ft @ 4,900 ",front wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

All the good stuff is optional.'],4.1,"A couple of new colors are the only modifications to the Suburban as Chevrolet prepares a redesigned model for 2000. In some sections of the country, wise middle-class folks have been tooling around for several years in mile-long Suburbans, whether or not they have great need for all that expanse behind the driver's seat.  These days, throughout the suburban reaches of Houston and Dallas, among other spots, the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban have become de facto status-flaunting vehicles, pushing prices beyond the reach of the common man.Yes, those who formerly wheeled about town in a Cadillac, and wouldn't feel quite right in a pickup truck, appear to have twirled their affections toward the biggest passenger vehicles in the General Motors repertoire.  Chevrolet, in fact, considers the Suburban ""as suited to the country club as to a roughneck oil field."" Mechanically, you get the same layout in the smaller Chevrolet Tahoe, but that vehicle is only available with Chevy's Vortec 5700 V8 engine.  Select a Suburban and you can accept that motor, with 255 horsepower.  Or, with the 3/4-ton C/K 2500 series you can go all the way, opting for the mammoth Vortec 7400 V8, whipping out 290 strutting horses and a mean 410 pound-feet of ground-tromping torque.  Oh, there's also an optional turbo-diesel.  Both the half- and 3/4-ton versions come with either two- or four-wheel drive, and all have four-wheel anti-lock braking.Last year Chevrolet introduced a new four-wheel drive system to the Suburban.  Called Autotrac, it automatically shifts from 2WD to 4WD when wheel slippage is detected, just like Ford's Control-Trac system in the similarly gargantuan Expedition.   This year, Chevy makes a couple of new colors available.Buyers beware that Chevrolet is preparing to introduce a completely new Suburban for the 2000 model year.  Based upon the rigid new Silverado pickup platform, the redesigned 'Burban will be much improved inside and out.

Most substantial is the addition of an optional fourth access door to extended cab models. The already potent Vortec 4800 and 5300 V8 engines make more power, and programmable door locks can be instructed to unlock automatically when the Silverado is shut off. A Sportside cargo box is available on 1500 LT models, and 1500 4WD trucks can be equipped with wheel flares this year. LS and LT trucks get a standard electrochromic self-dimming rearview mirror with compass and exterior temperature display, and a soft tonneau cover is available from the factory. Chevrolet makes a pretty good pick-'em-up if powerful engines are your thing. But even after a recent redesign, it still has a ways to go to match the Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra when it comes to the quality of the materials and assembly. Imagine the pressure engineers and designers suffered when they undertook the task of completely revising the best-selling model that General Motors produces. Success would insure that GM could continue to reap large benefits from a booming truck industry. Failure would reduce market share, profits and credibility. Making matters worse, the existing platform was already a hot seller. How to fix something that wasn't broken?They started by asking Chevy truck customers what they wanted in a new full-size pickup.  More power, better handling, more interior room, better fuel economy and a stronger chassis were the answers. What they most certainly did not want was cartoonish or carlike styling, which Chevy owners felt the Dodge and Ford stores were selling.So Chevrolet gave the customer what they asked for. Looking at the Silverado, some might be hard-pressed to discern differences between it and the old C/K model. But under the skin, GM served up a heaping pile of massive improvement, and that's where it counts.Several engine choices are available, ranging from a newly improved 4.3-liter V6 to a turbodiesel 6.5-liter V8.  Most buyers select 4800 and 5300 Vortec V8 engines, and they make more power for 2000.  The 4.8-liter and 5.3-liter units each generate 15 more ponies than they did in '99, but only the 5300 motor gets a boost in torque, from 315 foot-pounds at 4,000 to 325 ft-lbs. at the same revs.  The 6.0-liter V8 gets a new high-extension torque converter when equipped with the available automatic transmission.  Automatics also come equipped with a tow-haul mode that improves performance under heavy loads.Holding all this together is a three-section frame that is stiff, light and easy to assemble.  It contributes to class-leading impact absorption, a smooth ride and a quiet interior. Payload capacity is stout as well.  State-of-the-art steering, suspension and braking systems help make driving the Silverado a joy. Four-wheel disc antilock brakes are standard, and steering feel is tight for a large truck, thanks in part to the power rack-and-pinion gear on models under 6,400 GVWR.  The turning circle is relatively small and a wide rear track contributes to stability on the highway. Optional is Adjustable Electronic Ride Control, the first selective damping system ever offered on a pickup.Inside, Silverado buyers will find logically laid out switchgear, though the plastics feel like they're sourced from the same supplier contracted by Fisher Price. The cabin is roomy, particularly on extended cab models. Standard back doors on the latter make entry and exit to the rear bench seat easy, and if front passengers are willing to sacrifice a bit of legroom, the back of the extended cab is quite comfortable. Front seatbelts are mounted to the seats themselves so rear passengers don't need to chop through a web of fabric to get in and out.Other changes this year include power door locks that can be programmed to unlock automatically when the Silverado is shut off, solving an irritating problem on 1999 trucks.  A Sportside cargo box is available on 1500 LT models, and 1500 4WD trucks can be equipped with wheel flares this year.  Optional on the LS and standard on the LT trucks are an electrochromic self-dimming rearview mirror with compass and exterior temperature display. A soft tonneau cover is available on the LT Fleetside Box version only.The bar was raised with the introduction of the Chevy Silverado, and GM bean counters needn't worry about their bonuses at year's end.

While subcompact SUVs  are perfectly suited for one or two people, they don't have the passenger space  or cargo capacity that shoppers look for when upgrading from a sedan or  hatchback. Some small SUVs have other strengths — expressive styling  or fun-to-drive dynamics, for example — to make up for the lack of  room. This is not the case, however, with the 2020 Chevrolet Trax. Though an  acceptable choice overall, the Trax doesn't offer anything unique compared to  similarly priced crossovers and cars. 
The  Trax has a few redeeming qualities. It is easy to get into, generally  affordable, and the tall ride height and large windows give drivers the  expansive outward view preferred by SUV owners. Unfortunately, the benefits are  vastly outweighed by its drawbacks. Passenger comfort is hampered by a harsh  ride quality and narrow, unsupportive seats. The rear seat is a little  claustrophobic, and there's  less cargo room than in a Volkswagen Golf hatchback. And while most  entries in the class have modestly powered engines, the Trax's turbocharged  1.4-liter four-cylinder fails to live up to even those low expectations. There  are a number of desirable small crossovers, and we suggest driving any of them  before settling on the Chevrolet Trax. The  base LS is priced competitively and comes with enough features that it doesn't  feel like a penalty box. If you have a little extra in your budget, however, we  recommend upgrading to the LT. It  has some useful convenience features, such as upgraded headlights and a cargo cover. It's also  more versatile, with several packages that add options such as keyless entry and advanced driving  aids.",Inline 4 cylinder ,260," 148 lb-ft @ 1,850 ",front wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

For the Limited trim, the six-CD changer is now standard as well. With its outstanding warranty coverage and a longer list of standard features this year, the 2008 Hyundai Tucson compact SUV remains a solid choice for value-oriented consumers. Since its introduction three years ago, the Hyundai Tucson has been a solid choice for compact-SUV shoppers. It's generously equipped with lots of standard features and safety equipment, and its long warranty coverage is one of the best in the segment. Buyers have a choice between two engines and front- or all-wheel drive. And the Tucson delivers respectable carlike ride and handling dynamics that should satisfy most shoppers in this class.As is common for the segment, buyers can choose between four- and six-cylinder power. But compared to rivals, the 2008 Tucson's power plants are both down on power -- the V6 makes only 173 horsepower, not much more than competitors' four-cylinders. Furthermore, the Kia must make do with a four-speed automatic, while some other compact SUVs offer five-speed automatics. These downsides are also true for the Tucson's sibling, the Kia Sportage.With so many choices available for small SUVs these days, the 2008 Hyundai Tucson's detriments keep it from being one of our top picks. It's not as quick as the Toyota RAV4 V6, as sporty as the Mitsubishi Outlander or as refined as the Honda CR-V. However, its roomy passenger quarters, strong warranty and high value still make it worth considering, especially if you're on a tight budget. The base GLS comes with a 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine that puts out 140  and 136 pound-feet of torque. Power is transferred to the front wheels through a standard five-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed automatic with manual shift control. The Tucson SE and Limited provide a larger 2.7-liter V6 engine that generates 173 horses and 178 lb-ft of torque, coupled with the four-speed automatic. V6 models can be equipped with an all-wheel-drive system.V6 models will accelerate to 60 mph in about 10.7 seconds, about a second or so off the quicker four-cylinders in the segment and more than three ticks off the class hot rod, the RAV4 V6. Fuel mileage estimates for a 2008 Sportage V6 with AWD are 17 mpg city and 23 mpg highway, a bit below the class average. The four-cylinder gets only a couple city mpg better. The 2008 Hyundai Tucson offers a generous level of standard safety equipment for a vehicle in this class, including antilock disc brakes with brake assist, stability and traction control, front seat side-impact airbags, head curtain side airbags and active front head restraints. In government crash testing, Hyundai's compact SUV achieved a perfect five stars for both frontal- and side-impact protection. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Tucson received a second-highest ""Acceptable"" rating for both frontal-offset and side impacts. On the road, the 2008 Hyundai Tucson provides a carlike ride and relatively sporty handling that makes it a little more fun to drive than many other compact SUVs. It's capable of being both a good city runabout and a long-distance highway cruiser. Power from the standard four-cylinder is barely adequate, so we recommend you opt for the V6. The four-speed automatic isn't quite as smooth as the five-speed units offered by competitors, but it's alert enough to usually keep the V6 right in its power band. The Hyundai Tucson features a modern cabin design with a straightforward layout and good build quality. The quality of materials is inconsistent, however, with a few too many hard plastic surfaces and standard cloth trim of questionable taste. There's a generous amount of legroom up front, though larger passengers may be a bit cramped in back. When it's time to really load up, the rear seats fold flat to reveal 66 cubic feet of total capacity -- about mid-pack for its segment. Additionally, the front passenger seat folds down to allow long objects to be carried within the cabin. The Tucson SE adds premium cloth seat trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control, a trip computer and foglights. The Limited provides monochrome exterior trim, a windshield wiper de-icer, leather seating, heated front seats, automatic climate control and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Also standard for the Limited is a premium 200-watt six-disc CD changer audio system with a subwoofer.

As such, Blazer buyers this year will have to make do with slap-dash add-ons such as standard OnStar on the LT and TrailBlazer models.  Xtreme, a new trim level on the two-door, two-wheel-drive model which includes a low-riding sport suspension lowered by 2.5 inches, body cladding and special wheels, is now available. The ancient Blazer has effectively been replaced by the all-new, far superior TrailBazer ... and for good reason. Back in 1982, Chevrolet rolled out the S-10 Blazer, the first modern compact sport-utility vehicle.  Nineteen years later, the Blazer remains a strong seller in one of the hottest automotive markets. Take only one good look and it's easy to see why the attractive Blazer has such lasting appeal. Powered by a stout 4.3-liter, 190-horsepower V6 and available with several suspension choices, the Blazer can be tailored to specific needs, with either two-wheel or four-wheel drive, with two doors or four.There are accommodations for as many as six passengers in the bigger Blazer, if they don't mind squeezing. There's lots of cargo space too, with the spare tire mounted underneath the cargo floor on four-door models. Chevy claims that with the rear seat folded, a washing machine box will fit into the cargo bay. Sadly, the Blazer's interior is marred by acres of chintzy plastic and precious little rear foot room in front of a rather low and mushy seat.  Adult rear-seat riders are likely to complain loudly.Off road is not where the Blazer shines brightest, despite the availability of a ZR2 super-duty suspension package. Offered only on two-door 4WD models, the ZR2 Blazer has a special chassis with a wider track, huge 31-inch tires, specially tuned Bilstein 46mm shocks, and an underbody shield package. Regular Blazers are capable enough for two-track dirt, but serious off-road adventures would be better handled by something with a little more wheel travel.On the other hand, as a road-going hauler the Blazer is quite capable. All 4x4 models can be equipped with the available AutoTrac push-button electronic transfer case. AutoTrac automatically senses wheel slippage and sends power to the axle with the most traction, which makes those old full-time all-wheel-drive systems obsolete. This setup takes the guesswork out of sure-footed travel over wet or snowy pavement.GM's PassLock anti-theft system, automatic headlight control and four-wheel disc brakes are all standard. Heated exterior mirrors and an electrochromic rearview mirror are standard on LT models, and optional on the LS.  TrailBlazers come fully stocked with a long list of standard equipment.For 2001, Chevrolet has added a new trim level to the roster, for a total of four: LS, LT, Xtreme and TrailBlazer.  The automaker also has enhanced the durability of several key components ranging from the engine and airbag system to the brakes and exhaust.  As the 2002 model year will see substantial changes to the Blazer, the current version merely sees cosmetic changes, such as a lowered suspension and body-cladding on the Xtreme.When the current Blazer debuted for the 1995 model year, it won the North American Truck of the Year award. Smart styling, a powerful drivetrain and reasonable pricing made it an instant hit. Lately, however, the bar has been raised over the Blazer, as most competitors have been completely redesigned or substantially improved since its debut. Simply put, with new contenders bracketing Blazer in both the midsize and small SUV arena, this Chevy isn't the value it used to be.",V6 cylinder ,290," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Acura,acura integra,2000,acura integra 2000,"['Great performance, affordable price.']","['Cramped rear seat, dated appearance.']",4.9,"The Type-R is back, and it arrives with two more color choices. The four-speed automatic transmission has been enhanced for better shift quality, and all Integras now have a tune-up interval of 100,000 miles. An absolute gem back in 1994. Seven years is a long time to go without a major update, though. Integras have always been sporty, practical, fun-to-drive and reliable. They are popular cars with a wide demographic group. The current iteration is no exception. What has most people buzzing is the return of the enthusiast-favorite, the Type R, which had disappeared for the 1999 model year. In addition to the Type R, there's a GS, LS and GS-R.While comfortable for two and even livable for four full-sized adults, the Integra is first and foremost a driver's car. Think of it as a Japanese BMW 3 Series and you won't be far off. Sure it has fewer cylinders and the wrong set of wheels pulling it around, but if you can't afford the price of entry (or maintenance or insurance) for anything from Bavaria, the Integra makes an adequate substitute. With a fully independent four-wheel double-wishbone suspension, front and rear stabilizer bars and a thick steering wheel that gives excellent feedback about what's going on down below, the Integra is one of the top-handling front-drivers in the world. If competent handling was all the Integra had to offer, it would still be worth considering, even in today's competitive sport-compact market. Fortunately, Acura didn't stop there. The base engine, sold on GS and LS trim, is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder unit that makes an adequate 140 horsepower. Step up to the GS-R and you're rewarded with a VTEC-enhanced 1.8-liter inline four that boasts 170 horsepower and 128 foot-pounds of torque. The Type R is about as close as you can get to a street-legal race car for this price, and it makes a mighty 195 horsepower at 8,000 rpm, thanks to its hand-polished intake and exhaust ports and a high-flow exhaust system. Did we mention the 8,500-redline? You can bet that ""R"" is for rrrrrev. The Integra sport coupes and sedans are quick and comfortable, with excellent build quality. Seating, headroom and overall ergonomics are typical Honda: straightforward and functional. The shifter is one of the best in the industry, with a shape that fits the hand perfectly and a relatively short throw between gears. The bad news for the Integra is that the styling hasn't changed since 1994, and it's beginning to look a bit old hat. That means with cars like the Mercury Cougar clawing at the market, Acura will quickly need to prepare the Integra for life in the 21st century.",Inline 4 cylinder ,235," 124 lb-ft @ 5,200 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Hybrids use gasoline but reduce consumption by having an electric motor take  over at low speeds. Plug-in hybrids do the same, but let you recharge the  electric motor's battery for increased electric operation. And fully electric  cars, of course, run solely on electricity stored in battery cells.  
There's  another alternative: hydrogen. A hydrogen-powered car stores the gas inside  high-pressure tanks and uses it to generate power for an onboard electric  motor. No gasoline, no plugging into a wall outlet or charger. And the only  emission coming out of the tailpipe is water. 
The  2023 Toyota Mirai is one of only two publicly available hydrogen-powered cars  and even as a regular midsize sedan, it's fairly impressive. But the Mirai  represents a commitment even more than it does a car. The asking price is  substantial, and hydrogen fueling stations are few and far between. Toyota also  limits new sales of the Mirai to California and Oahu, Hawaii. The cost of  hydrogen itself is something to be aware of, but you won't have to worry about  it for a while. Toyota includes a hydrogen ""gas card"" with the  purchase or lease of a Mirai good for $15,000 or six years, whichever comes  first. 
Overall,  we like the Mirai. It sports a luxuriously smooth ride,  pleasantly trimmed cabin and solid build quality. It's also surprisingly  composed to drive through corners thanks to its rear-wheel-drive architecture  and excellent weight balance. But passenger and cargo space is limited, and  you'll have to factor in whether the lifestyle of a hydrogen-fueled car is  really for you.  Toyota  hasn't released official information on the 2023 Mirai as of this writing.  We'll update our recommendation if anything changes, but based on last year's  Mirai, we suggest going with the Limited.  Given the limited number of fueling stations, the Mirai is as much a lifestyle  commitment as it is a car.

Lexus,lexus rx-350,2016,lexus rx-350 2016,"['Impeccably crafted and attractively designed cabin', 'supremely quiet', 'appealing ride and handling balance with F Sport', 'strong value for the segment.']","['Below-average cargo capacity', 'distracting Remote Touch interface', 'relatively slow acceleration.']",3.8,"The Lexus RX has been completely redesigned for 2016. Comfort and interior quality are still key strengths for the redesigned 2016 Lexus RX 350, but a more carlike driving experience helps broaden its appeal. We think the latest RX is a smart pick for a luxury crossover SUV.Notably, we picked the Lexus RX 350  as one of Edmunds' Best Used Luxury SUVs for 2016. Let's get this out of the way right off the bat: The 2016  Lexus RX 350 has an extremely large grille. If that black expanse were any  bigger, Stephen Hawking would probably have to be called in to investigate for  the presence of a black hole. At the same time, the all-new RX also has enough  creases and sharp edges to make one think that Lexus delegated the design phase to a sword-slashing samurai. For a midsize crossover  that has been quite anodyne until now, this makeover is bound to be a bit  shocking.

An expansive new  grille is one of the many changes Lexus made to the 2016 RX 350.
More importantly, however, there are plenty of substantive  changes that make this luxury crossover SUV more carlike and indeed better than  ever before. For one thing, Lexus increased the 2016 RX 350's wheelbase and  overall length to improve interior space for passengers, while simultaneously  raising the ride height and slimming out the roof line. The result is a much  sleeker and less SUV-like profile, yet there's still abundant head- and legroom  in both seating rows.
Up front, the dashboard is lower and the center control  stack is more angled toward the driver (who also sits a bit lower), while the improved  materials and construction are absolutely first-rate. Most RX models you'll  find on a dealer lot will include the Navigation package with its colossal new 12.3-inch  display, one of the largest you'll find this side of a Tesla. This display comes  equipped with a revised, but still distracting-to-use Remote Touch controller that  we think requires more driver attention than it should. In general, though, the  new RX's infotainment features have been significantly updated to meet the  expectations of tech-savvy shoppers.
For power, the RX 350 stays the course with its 3.5-liter  V6, but now it makes 25 more horsepower (for a total of 295) and comes standard  with an eight-speed automatic transmission that helps boost fuel economy  slightly. Lexus has also retuned the suspension to provide better handling than  prior RX models. The RX 350 F Sport, in particular, finally delivers the goods,  boasting sharper steering than the standard version, plus an adaptive  suspension that yields an impressively controlled, yet still comfortable ride. Ultimately,  the F Sport is aimed more at mildly sporty competitors like the Acura MDX than at dedicated  performance models, but it's a gratifying drive nonetheless.
There are a few reasons to think twice about this new RX.  The aforementioned Remote Touch controller is one, along with modest acceleration  and limited cargo capacity compared to segment norms. Other choices like the BMW X5, Lincoln MKX, Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class, Volkswagen  Touareg and Volvo  XC90 are all worthy of a long look, and a few (including the MDX) offer  optional third-row seating as well. But with its long list of improvements, the  2016 RX 350 brings a welcome dose of excitement and modernity while still  maintaining the comfort and quality for which it's renowned. Every 2016 Lexus RX 350 is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 engine  good for 295  and 267 pound-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic  transmission and front-wheel drive are standard. All-wheel drive is optional  (standard with F Sport).
In Edmunds testing, a front-drive RX 350 made the 0-60-mph  sprint in 7.4 seconds, a slightly below-average time for a luxury crossover.  Maximum towing capacity, when properly equipped, is 3,500 pounds.
Lexus expects EPA-estimated fuel economy to be 23 mpg  combined (20 city/28 highway) with front-wheel drive, and 22 mpg combined (19/26) with all-wheel drive. The 2016 Lexus RX 350 comes standard with antilock brakes,  traction and stability control, front and rear side airbags, full-length side  curtain airbags and front knee airbags. A rearview camera is also standard  along with Lexus Enform Safety  Connect, which includes automatic collision notification, an emergency assist  button and a stolen vehicle locator.
Optional safety features include a blind spot warning system  bundled with rear-cross traffic alert. The Lexus Safety System + (requires  Premium, Luxury or F Sport package) adds adaptive cruise control, a frontal collision  warning and mitigation system with automatic braking and pedestrian detection,  lane-departure warning and lane departure intervention.
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the RX the best  possible rating of ""Good"" in its moderate-overlap and  small-overlap frontal-offset impact tests, as well as a ""Good"" rating  in the side-impact, roof strength and seat/head restraint (whiplash protection)  tests.
In Edmunds testing, a front-drive RX 350 came to a stop from  60 mph in 123 feet, a few feet longer than average. Power is merely sufficient in the RX 350, whereas the  acceleration of most competitors would be described as at least energetic. The  nebulous response and inconsistent effort of the standard RX steering setup also  leaves something to be desired, while the standard suspension tuning doesn't instill  the same level of confidence and control provided by most rivals. This RX is  dynamically better than before, and certainly plenty comfortable and supremely  quiet, but that's about as far as the platitudes go.
The exception, though, is the RX 350 F Sport. It doesn't do  anything for the engine apart from piping extra noise into the cabin, but the  rest of the dynamic package is greatly improved. The steering is more  consistent in its weighting, even when switched into one of two Sport modes. It's  the F Sport's adaptive suspension, though, that makes it the best of the RX  bunch. Never mind the handling improvements. The main benefit is that the RX's  body is more controlled when driving over bumps, yet the ride remains genuinely  comfortable. We were surprised to find that it was perfectly pleasant even in the  suspension's firmest, Sport S+ setting. Really, the F Sport feels ""just  right"" and drives in a fashion similar to the MDX, if not quite the BMW  X5.  With its lower seating position and driver-focused dashboard  design, the 2016 Lexus RX 350 is palpably more carlike than its predecessors. But  rest assured, you still get that elevated view of the surroundings that makes  crossovers so popular. The overall design is also visually appealing  (especially in the available two-tone color schemes), while the quality of materials  and construction has been elevated to the same level as most upper-crust  competitors (and above that of the Acura MDX).

The Lexus RX 350  has one of the nicest interiors in the midsize crossover segment.
There's plenty of headroom in the cabin despite the more  radically raked roof line, even if some may find it a tad claustrophobic  compared to some competitors (especially the airy Volvo XC90). The sliding and  reclining backseat is wide and comfortable, with abundant legroom for even tall  occupants, while further benefiting from optional power adjustment. The front  seats seemed supportive during our initial test-drives, though larger drivers  may find the F Sport model's sport seats too confining.
Cargo capacity leaves something to be desired. With that  radically raked roof line, there's not much space above the cargo cover,  meaning bulkier items are less likely to fit. Furthermore, the 40/20/40-split rear  seatback doesn't quite fold flat. Listed cargo capacity is 18.4 cubic feet  behind the second row and 56.3 cubic feet with the seats folded. Lexus has  changed the way it measures total capacity, so these numbers aren't directly  comparable to the previous RX, but suffice it to say that the new RX has less  overall space than its competitors. There's also the fact that the MDX and XC90  have an extra row of seats.
Another downside is the Remote Touch electronics interface.  Its mini-joystick-like controller is superior to the irritating  toucad found in the Lexus NX and RC, but this interface still requires a  distracting degree of dexterity and concentration to operate effectively. If  there's a silver lining, it's that Lexus bundles Remote Touch with the upgraded  and truly sharp and impressive-looking 12.3-inch display.

A large,  high-definition display screen tops a redesigned center stack. 

Lexus turns its  back on the conservative styling of the old RX in favor of a fresh, exciting  design.
Standard equipment on the RX 350 includes 18-inch wheels,  automatic LED headlights, LED foglights and running lights, rear privacy glass,  a power liftgate, keyless ignition and entry, selectable drive mode settings  (alter steering, gas pedal sensitivity and transmission shift program), dual-zone  automatic climate control, eight-way power front seats (with two-way power  lumbar adjustment), a power tilt-and-telescoping leather-wrapped steering  wheel, a 40/20/40-split rear seat (reclines, slides and folds), and ""NuLuxe""  premium vinyl upholstery. You also get a rearview camera, ""Safety Connect""  emergency communications (see Safety section), Bluetooth phone and audio  connectivity, the Display Audio tech interface (with a knob controller and an 8-inch  display) and a nine-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite and HD  radio, an auxiliary audio jack, two USB ports and a media player interface.
The F Sport is technically a package and includes sportier  exterior styling, 20-inch wheels, adaptive suspension dampers, additional drive  mode settings, an engine noise enhancer, transmission paddle shifters, special  gauges, heated and ventilated sport seats, leather upholstery and special  interior trim.
Options are grouped into packages or are stand-alone items. The  availability of both can often depend on where you live.
The Premium package adds roof rails, automatic wipers,  driver memory functions, leather upholstery, wood trim and a rear armrest  storage compartment. The Navigation package adds, beyond the obvious, the  Remote Touch electronics interface, a bigger 12.3-inch display, voice controls,  the Lexus Enform App Suite and a 12-speaker sound system.
The Luxury package includes the Premium package items and  adds 20-inch wheels (with a choice of color inserts), heated and ventilated  front seats, a heated steering wheel, rear door sunshades, upgraded leather  upholstery, four-way front seat lumbar adjustment, heated rear seats and power  operation for the folding and reclining rear seatbacks. The Luxury package can  be enhanced with a rear seat entertainment system, which includes two 11.6-inch  angle-adjustable screens, a DVD player, an HDMI port and a 120-volt household-style  power outlet.
Options that require the Premium, Luxury or F Sport packages  include a blind-spot monitor with rear cross-traffic alert, a panoramic-view  back-up camera and either a regular or panoramic sunroof. There's also a Lexus  Safety System + package that consists of adaptive cruise control and accident  avoidance features described in the Safety section below.
Other options include front and rear parking sensors, a hands-free  power liftgate, upgraded LED headlights (with 18 individual LED accent lights),  a color head-up display, a heated steering wheel and a 15-speaker Mark Levinson  sound system.",,268," 267 lb-ft @ 4,700 ",front wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

The Zanardi Edition adds BBS alloy wheels, a titanium shifter and softer red-stitched leather seats. And it wouldn't be a tribute to the CART champion without a stiffer suspension and lower height. Since its introduction eight years ago, the Acura NSX has been heralded by much of the motoring press as the best sports car ever produced.  We're inclined to agree.  With its 24-valve V6 engine, all-aluminum body, mid-engine layout and traditionally Honda-correct ergonomics, the NSX is one helluva car.  In a word, it's awesome. Well-balanced, perfectly poised, easy to drive, powerful, graceful -- the NSX is a precision instrument that is forgiving enough to make drivers of diverse skill feel like pros.  The 3.2-liter engine cranks out 290 horsepower and moves the car to 60 mph in about five seconds.  While other cars may be faster, no sports car handles so well as the NSX.  Though largely unchanged from the 1991 introductory model, the current NSX is still a dream ride.  The mid-engine design provides excellent weight distribution, keeping the wheels securely planted around turns.  Braking is also an NSX strong point, at 122 feet from 60 to zero. Inside, the NSX is as comfortable to drive as the Honda Accord. All controls are logically placed, the seating position is nothing short of perfect, the targa top is easily stored and visibility is better than any other sports car in the world.If you can overlook the fact that the car's styling has not been touched since it was born, the NSX is still quite attractive.  In fact, rather than revise the appearance, Acura has decided to treat enthusiasts to a special Alex Zanardi Edition NSX for 1999, available in one color: Formula Red.  Tipping their hats to their two-time CART champ, Honda has developed the special edition with performance in mind: the car loses 150 pounds of weight and is further enhanced with a stiffer suspension and manual steering.  Only 50 of the special edition cars will be built for sale in North America, and Alex Zanardi himself will be honored with the first one off the assembly line.  So act now while supplies last.As a purist test of automotive excellence, the NSX is unsurpassed.  Shift action is simply amazing, the clutch and brake pedals are well-placed and provide excellent feedback, and steering is razor-sharp.  Where the car fails, however, is in the price of greatness.  It's simply too expensive.  For the same price as a three-car garage complete with Chevrolet Corvette, Jeep Wrangler and Honda Accord, one can afford a single Acura NSX.While the future of the NSX is not certain, it's still a car worth considering.  Its rev-happy powerplant makes it appealing for those desiring a supercar, while its livable interior and excellent ergonomics make it practical enough to live with on a daily basis.  And it's sure to set the stage for quite a tailgate party in the parking lot of Laguna Seca on race day.",V6 cylinder ,248," 224 lb-ft @ 5,500 ",front wheel drive , 6-speed manual 
Chevrolet,chevrolet express,2006,chevrolet express 2006,"['Strong powertrains, dual-passenger access doors, multiple wheelbase and passenger configurations, optional all-wheel drive.']","['Low-grade interior plastics, awkward handling.']",4.3,"Last year's base model becomes the LS, and the former LS is now the LT. OnStar has been removed from the options list.  The 2006 Chevrolet Express is pretty much the only game in town if you're looking for a full-size van that doesn't look and drive like it was designed two decades ago. Originally introduced in 1965, Chevrolet's full-size van has since undergone only one complete redesign. Constant improvements throughout the '70s, '80s and '90s kept it somewhat up to date, but not until a full redesign in 1995 did the Chevy Express become a legitimately modern vehicle.A new exterior look, new engines, extended body styles and improved ergonomics soon made the Chevrolet Express hard to overlook when compared with Ford's aging Econoline. Changes in 2003 to Chevy's full-size van didn't constitute a complete redesign, but the Express did benefit from a wider selection of V8 engines, the first-time availability of all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements -- all of which went a long way toward making this Chevy van safer and more capable than ever before. Chevrolet Express vans offer a choice of four power plants and either rear- or all-wheel drive. The standard engine on two-wheel-drive 1500 models is a 4.3-liter V6 rated at 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A 5.3-liter V8 with 295  and 335 lb-ft of torque is standard on all-wheel-drive 1500s and optional on rear-drive versions. The 2500 models come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 rated at 285  and 295 lb-ft of torque and can be ordered with a 6.0-liter V8 rated at 300  and 360 lb-ft of torque. The 6.0-liter is standard on 3500s. All 1500 models use a four-speed automatic, while 2500 and 3500 get a heavy-duty version of that transmission. The maximum trailer towing capacity on 1500 models is 6,600 pounds, while the heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 can pull 10,000 pounds, properly equipped. All Chevy Express vans have four-wheel antilock disc brakes standard. Light-duty models (GVWR less than 8,600 pounds) feature a front-passenger sensing system that will deactivate the front airbag if it senses a small adult or child sitting up front. Heavy-duty models use a manual airbag deactivation switch for the front passenger. A stability control system is standard on one-ton regular-wheelbase vans only.  A reinforced frame, larger sway bars, rack and pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2006 Chevrolet Express a leg up on the competition when it comes to ride and handling. Although this Chevy van is still far from nimble, it's a better choice for day-to-day driving than the competition. And with three strong V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers come easily, even when you're hauling a heavy load.  The interior of the Chevy Express is built for pure functionality, and while it may not be pretty, it sure gets the job done. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but the footwells remain as cramped as ever. Buyers can opt for 60/40-split driver-side doors for easier passenger access to the rear seats. The standard configuration seats 12, with 8- or 15-passenger arrangements also available, depending on which model you choose. The standard-wheelbase (135-inch) Chevrolet Express comes in half-ton (1500), three-quarter-ton (2500) and one-ton (3500) configurations, while the extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) requires one-ton running gear. There are two trim levels: LS and LT. LS models are geared toward fleet service so standard equipment is limited to air conditioning, an AM/FM stereo and a theft-deterrent system. The more livable LT models include rear-seat climate controls, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and keyless entry. Optional equipment includes power driver and front-passenger seats, alloy wheels and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer.",V6 cylinder ,200," 260 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 4-speed automatic 
Buick,buick encore,,buick encore 2022,"['Hushed cabin at highway speeds', 'Maneuverable size', 'Excellent outward visibility']",,,"The  2022 Buick Encore is an extra-small SUV that slots alongside the Encore GX (a  wholly different vehicle reviewed separately) as an entry-level model in  Buick's lineup. Buick has been paring down the Encore over the past few years,  cutting the number of trims and features available. For 2022, the Encore is now  only available in a single trim level, and some features have been removed or  added to equipment packages. It's not all about slimming it down. The Encore's  engine gets a significant bump in power for 2022, helping alleviate the Buick's  sluggish acceleration. 
The  Encore competes in an extremely crowded class, with many automakers (including  Buick) offering multiple vehicles around this size and price point. Some of our  favorites include the Mazda CX-30, the Hyundai Kona, the Subaru Crosstrek and  the Encore GX, all of which we think are better alternatives to the Encore.  Despite the bump in power for 2022, the Encore still feels dated and several  steps behind the class leaders. For  2022, the Encore is only available in a single trim level: Preferred. We suggest adding both the Safety Package and Safety  Package II for features including blind-spot monitoring and forward  collision alert.

Honda,honda cr-v,2000,honda cr-v 2000,"['Honda quality, spacious interior, good highway ride.']","['Not enough torque, noisy at high speeds, goofy window switch placement.']",4.5,"The 2000 Honda CR-V gets a new SE (Special Edition) package that features a leather-lined cabin. Underpowered compared to the competition, but still an excellent choice for those wanting a comfortable and versatile mini SUV. If sport-utilities were driven the way they were originally intended, you'd have a hard time convincing yourself that the 2000 Honda CR-V is the vehicle of choice. However, since most of the SUVs purchased these days spend all of their time on the road, the CR-V offers a great combination of a carlike ride and interior with trucklike visibility and ground clearance.Built on the Civic platform, the CR-V successfully integrates familiar Honda components into a visually pleasing design. The 2.0-liter DOHC inline four-cylinder engine is back again, making 146 horsepower and 133 pound-feet of torque. Honda's familiar four-speed automatic transmission -- with an overdrive on/off switch -- or a precise 5-speed manual gearbox put that power to the wheels and a four-wheel double-wishbone suspension gives this vehicle its nice ride.The CR-V's Real Time four-wheel-drive system is a derivative of the unit that Honda initially offered on their Civic wagon. All 4WD models come with a five-speed manual transmission, while the four-speed automatic is optional. A front-wheel-drive model is offered, but it comes only with the automatic transmission. The result of using all of these car components is not surprising: the CR-V looks and feels like a car.The CR-V's interior is instantly recognizable to anyone who has spent time in Honda's passenger cars. Functionality takes precedence over style in the CR-V's cabin, and the result is easy-to-read gauges, well-placed controls (except for dash-mounted electric window switches), and high-quality, if somewhat uninspired, interior materials. Cargo capacity is an impressive 67.2 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded. The CR-V offers comfortable chairs for its occupants, each of which provides excellent visibility and the ability to recline when the trip grows long. The front passenger benefits from a left-side armrest and rear passengers will enjoy the door-mounted cupholders.Available in either LX, EX or SE trim levels, the CR-V is surprisingly well-equipped even in base LX form. Air conditioning with a filtration system is standard, as are power windows, power door locks, rear window wiper and defogger, AM/FM stereo with cassette, cruise control and a folding picnic table that doubles as a cargo area cover. Antilock brakes are available only on the EX and SE models, which also come with a CD player, remote entry system and alloy wheels. Checking the SE package adds leather-trimmed interior, privacy glass, AM/FM/cassette/in-dash CD stereo, chrome grille accent and bodycolor bumpers, side moldings and hard spare tire cover.The CR-V is not meant to replace hard-core recreational vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler or Toyota 4Runner. Instead, it is meant for the person who wants the look and feel of a sport-utility without having to pay an exorbitant sticker price and huge gas bills. The CR-V will get people to work and back in all but the worst weather, and to their favorite picnic area, assuming it's not on the Rubicon Trail.",Inline 4 cylinder ,145," 133 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",, 5-speed manual

Side airbags are standard for all V6 models and EX four-cylinders with the leather interior. The feature-laden 2000 Honda Accord SE Sedan makes its debut this year. In the paint department, Nighthawk Black replaces Starlight Black, and Naples Gold Metallic replaces Heather Mist Metallic; Raisin and Currant have been dropped. No question as to why the Accord is one of the top-selling cars in America. It's simply good. The benchmark. The best-selling car in America. The highest resale value in its class. These are all statements that have been made with regularity concerning the Honda Accord, a vehicle that is always on the short list of the most popular cars in this country. The Accord won a loyal base of customers by offering notable performance, room for four, frugal fuel economy and a virtual guarantee that, if cared for properly, it would not break. Totally redesigned two years ago, the Accord is considered by many to be a good value for a family sedan. The sixth-generation Accord is available in coupe and sedan bodies, and LX, SE and EX models come with a VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) engine, be it a 2.3-liter four-cylinder (which gets 150 horsepower) or a 3.0-liter V6 (200 horsepower); the 3.0-liter is a model of refinement, revving smoothly and silently. The standard 2.3-liter four-banger in the DX Sedan was re-engineered last year and is worth 135 horses. Now that we've praised the living daylights out of this car, here's some bad news: The low price of the DX is accompanied by a low level of equipment. Also, the Accord is easy to drive, but it doesn't reward the driver much for the efforts. Despite minor body roll, braking and handling are good, the transmission shifts smoothly, and the steering is light and effortless.As with the Toyota Camry, refinement and attention to detail are the Accord's strengths. Almost all interior materials are pleasing to the eye and touch, and are assembled with great care. Gap tolerances are about half what you'd find in American products. Storage room abounds; the Accord resembles a minivan with so many places to stash maps, drinks, change, and assorted detritus. Spacious, comfortable and quiet, the Accord will tote many happy campers for miles on end. The seats are comfortable, both front and rear. There is an immense amount of storage and passenger space inside the car, and ergonomics are nearly flawless.While not exactly spicy, the Honda Accord is a quality, fine-tuned car exhibiting remarkable design because it is so functional and user-friendly. The bottom line is that Honda builds the ultimate midsize car. A low price, a high level of refinement, a cavernous interior, and a well-deserved reputation for reliability put the Accord at the top of the heap. Even a loaded top-of-the-line EX model with leather, alloy wheels, power moonroof, automatic climate control, CD player, premium sound, and steering-wheel radio controls stickers for about $25,000. The Accord is the definitive family sedan or coupe, and it's the benchmark by which all other midsize cars are measured.",Inline 4 cylinder ,210," 152 lb-ft @ 4,900 ",, 5-speed manual

When Mazda announced in 1989 that it had revived the traditional roadster, enthusiasts around the world clutched their chests in horror. A Japanese company trying to capture the essence of MG, Fiat, Alfa Romeo and Lotus two-seaters of the '60s? Blasphemy! Welcome to the '90s, when you can buy the most driving fun you've ever had for less than a Ford Taurus LX. As an added bonus, the MX-5 Miata doesn't leak oil from the engine bay or water from the roof. It doesn't overheat, fry its electrical system, or scare you in the twisties. You can drive it all day without carrying tools, Go Jo, or Doan's pills. The MX-5 Miata is truly a modern automotive miracle.For 1995, this sprightly convertible gets some revised option groups. Last year, Mazda added a passenger-side airbag, side-impact protection hardware, new alloy wheels and a bigger engine good for an extra 12 horsepower. Carried over from last year is the R-Package, which turns the Miata into a race-ready street machine with drivetrain and suspension modifications. Leather seats are still available, and a new color, Montego Blue, fleshes out the color chart, joining black, red, medium blue and white.There is nothing like the Miata on the market today.

A CD player becomes standard, the automatic climate control has been revised and rear-seat side airbags are optional for both the coupe and convertible. Several of our editors would be driving the 2002 BMW M3 today if we were in a more lucrative field. Lotto tickets, anyone? Last year, the boys of Bavaria finally relented and sent us the potent M3. Boy howdy, was it worth the wait. The M3 coupe and convertible, based on the delectable current-generation 3 Series, is propelled by a magnificent 3.2-liter engine, with 333 thundering horses coming from a single bank of naturally aspirated six cylinders.  Capped with a six-speed manual transmission, all that horsepower and the 262 pound-feet of torque (at 4,900 rpm) is good enough to propel the 3,781-pound M3 convertible to 60 mph in just 5.4 seconds, according to BMW. The lighter 3,415-pound M3 coupe, meanwhile, reportedly gets the job done in an even quicker 4.8 seconds. New for the year, an optional Sequential Manual Gearbox (SMG) provides Formula One-style paddle shifting on the steering wheel and reportedly allows the transmission to shift faster than a skilled driver can shift a manual or a conventional automatic can shift itself.But an exhilarating driving experience involves more than mere speed, and the dynamics of the M3 have car reviewers frothing at the mouth to describe the joy derived from piloting this vehicle. From its communicative steering and near-perfectly balanced chassis to the compliant-yet-firm ride, this Bimmer, like most others, will have you searching for that elusive twisty road upon which to spool the revs and extract that stunning exhaust note.  Don't think that you'd be lacking structural rigidity should you opt for open-topped fun. In fact, BMW claims that this version of the ragtop boasts a superstructure more rigid than the previous-generation 3 Series coupe. It's quite an accomplishment and the perfect accompaniment to the M3's superb MacPherson strut front and double-wishbone rear independent suspension system. Standard features for the convertible include heated power-adjustable sport bucket seats; these are optional on the coupe. For 2002, a CD player finally makes its way onto the standard equipment list. There are front and side airbags (coupes get a head protection system for front seat occupants, too), as well as optional rear-seat side airbags for safety, and, of course, antilock brakes are standard. BMW's Dynamic Stability Control system also makes the grade, and the drop-top version of the M3 gets a Rollover Protection System that automatically deploys roll hoops behind the rear seats in case the ragtop ever goes end over end. Other options include a removable hard top for the convertible and a Cold Weather package for the coupe that includes a ski bag, heated front seats and a headlight washer system that'll make the cars more palatable during the winter months. A proximity-sensing Park Distance Control system will probably save a few costly scratches to the bumpers, and a navigation system with a wider screen for 2002 lets you know where you're going. We think that the 3 Series is one of the best cars on the market today, and the M package increases its appeal exponentially. These beauts should have enough oomph and athletic prowess to have the competition whimpering in the corner.

Toyota,toyota avalon,2003,toyota avalon 2003,"['Lexus-like quality, smooth V6 engine, huge rear seat.']","['High price tag, bland personality.']",4.8,"A few minor changes are in store for Toyota's large sedan. On the outside, you'll find freshened styling that consists of a new grille, new taillamps and redesigned bumpers. Inside, the 2003 Avalon has been upgraded with dual-stage airbags and ISO-FIX child safety seat anchor points. XLS models also have more features this year, including an autodimming driver-side mirror, rain-sensing wipers, a simulated wood-trimmed steering wheel and an optional navigation system. A comfortable, though pasteurized, full-size sedan. Introduction: It would seem buyers of full-size sedans generally aren't interested in character. Most big four-doors are dull pieces of machinery to look at and a snooze to drive. The beauty in such a vehicle lies in what it can do for the customer in terms of providing space for people and things without compromising the ride or occupant comfort. It should look upscale, but not gaudy, providing just enough glitz and luxury to let others know you have achieved a degree of success in life. Finally, such a vehicle must also be reliable and able to handle years of daily-driver tasks without so much as a whimper. Since its introduction in 1995, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description: bland as egg whites, but solid, roomy and dependable. It's a popular seller and often exceeds the full-size sedan-buyer's expectations. Sure, the price is higher than offerings from Detroit like the Buick LeSabre and Mercury Grand Marquis,but unflappable quality doesn't come cheap. Want a Lexus but need six-passenger capacity or huge amounts of rear legroom? The Avalon is your car.Body Styles, Trim Levels and Options: The Avalon is based on the previous-generation Camry platform and it shares the latter's main mechanical components. There are two trim levels from which to choose: XL and XLS. The main difference between the two is the level of standard equipment. XL will get you the basics like dual-zone climate control, cruise control, a CD player, a multifunction information display and power locks and windows. The XLS is the more luxurious version that adds extra features like a premium JBL audio system, HomeLink, remote keyless entry, heated outside mirrors, automatic dual-zone climate control, and aluminum wheels.The Avalon can be ordered with front bucket or bench seats trimmed in either leather or cloth upholstery. Other options, depending on trim, include a premium audio system with a six-disc in-dash CD changer, a driver's seat memory feature, heated front seats, a sunroof and a 115-volt A/C outlet capable of powering small electronic devices. Also new this year is a DVD-based navigation system.Powertrains and Performance: The Avalon relies on a 3.0-liter V6 engine. Equipped with variable valve timing, this V6 offers good fuel economy and power. It produces 210 horsepower and 220 pound-feet of torque, which is transmitted to the front wheels through a four-speed automatic. These horses are more than enough for city driving and highway passing, and owners can expect 0-to-60 mph acceleration times to take about 8 seconds.Safety: One of Avalon's strengths lies in safety. The car has earned a crash-test rating of ""Good"" (the highest possible) from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and better-than-average scores from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Side airbags are standard, and Toyota's Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), can be added to the Avalon XLS. This system includes traction and stability control systems that can reduce the chance of hazardous skids and slides. It also includes a brake-assist system that detects emergency braking and applies supplemental pressure to reduce stopping distances. All Avalons have ABS-equipped four-wheel disc brakes. Interior Design and Special Features: Toyota's full-size car is also great for transporting people and luggage. While billed as a six-passenger car with the front bench, the middle front occupant doesn't have much legroom. We recommend getting an Avalon with the comfortable and supportive bucket seats unless there is genuine need for six-passenger seating. The trunk holds 15.9 cubic feet of cargo, and there is a locking pass-through door behind the rear seat. This pass-through allows room for longer items such as skis.Driving Impressions: Road and wind noise is minimal thanks to thick side glass and substantial sound-deadening materials. Once moving, the Avalon's light steering and soft suspension make for comfortable long-distance cruising. It isn't a particularly interesting car to drive, so drivers wanting a bit of involvement will be dissapointed. But if all you're looking for is dependable and comfortable transportation with a minimum of hassles, the Avalon should serve you well.",V6 cylinder ,310," 220 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",, 4-speed automatic

The 2.8 gains a revised deck lid and expanded central locking features. All models have new cloth upholstery, and the console and armrests are trimmed with the same fabric as the seats. Three new colors debut for 1997. Buy this car.  Audi's A4 is sleek, sophisticated, and speedy, and has won praise from the worldwide automotive media.  Small but safe, the A4 scored best in its class in the 35-mph offset crash tests performed in Europe, and performed brilliantly in stateside crash testing.  For U.S. buyers, this translates into a competent and crashworthy alternative to the BMW 3-Series, Acura TL-Series, and Volvo 850, among others.For 1997, two versions will be available: the 1.8T and the 2.8.  The 2.8 is powered by a 2.8-liter V6 engine putting 172 horsepower through the front wheels.  New is the 1.8T, which features a turbocharged, 20-valve inline four-cylinder engine good for 150 horsepower.  The 1.8T is available in the same configurations as the 2.8; front- or all-wheel drive with a five-speed manual transmission or an automatic.The A4 features a multi-link front suspension that virtually eliminates torque steer, according to Audi.  We've tried a front driver, and their claims have been substantiated.  Quattro all-wheel drive continues as a stand-alone option, reasonably priced at about $1,600.  Dual front airbags and antilock brakes come standard.  Purchase an A4 and enjoy free maintenance for three years and 50,000 miles.Audi's new 1.8T model features fresh alloy wheels, a unique Sport package, and a base price starting in the low 20s.  All early-build A4 1.8T models will be automatics.  Standard equipment on the more expensive 2.8 includes a more powerful V6 engine, alloy wheels, wood trim, and fog lights.  The 2.8's eight-way power driver's seat with lumbar support is exceptionally comfortable.  Leather upholstery is only available on the 2.8.  A theft alarm keeps thieves from making off with the radio or anything else left in an unattended car.In June of 1997, Audi released a new and improved version of the 2.8.  A five-valve 2.8-liter V6 was installed under the hood, putting 190 horsepower and 207 ft-lbs. of torque to the ground through a five-speed manual or five-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission.  Audi says the new engine takes the front-wheel drive and quattro versions of the A4 from rest to 60 mph in 7.1 seconds with a manual transmission.  Opt for the Tiptronic automatic, and the acceleration times drop to 8.2 seconds on front-wheel drive models and 8.8 seconds for the quattro.  Side-impact airbags that reside in the sides of the front seats were added, along with Jacquard satin cloth upholstery.  Anti-slip regulation (ASR), an all-speed traction control system, became standard.  An optional sports performance package includes a slightly lowered suspension, higher rate springs and shocks, unique alloy wheels, and Z-rated performance tires. A short options list reveals that almost everything you need comes standard on the A4 2.8.  With prices starting near $28,000, this means that you can get a status car that is comfortable, well equipped and costs less than it does to send your kid to college.  We think that Audi has a winner with the A4, and the addition of the even more affordable 1.8T and much-improved 1998 2.8 will do nothing but enhance Audi's image with near luxury buyers.",V6 cylinder ,125," 184 lb-ft @ 3,000 ",, 5-speed manual

That all changed a few years ago with the introduction of  the 4xe (pronounced ""four-by-e"") line of plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).  Last year brought the debut of the Grand Cherokee 4xe, a midsize SUV that has  all of the all-terrain prowess expected of the brand, with an electric twist. 
The  2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe is estimated to offer 26 miles of electric-only  range on a full charge and 23 mpg from the hybrid engine in combined city and  highway driving. That will save you in fuel costs compared to the V6-powered  Grand Cherokee, which is rated at 22 mpg. Meanwhile, the model with the  optional V8 is estimated at only 17 mpg combined.
For  2023, the Grand Cherokee 4xe returns with only a few changes. The  off-road-focused Trailhawk trim is now exclusive to the 4xe powertrain. That  trim and the Overland now come with a larger 10.1-inch infotainment  touchscreen. There's also a new 30th Anniversary model as well as a new High  Altitude appearance package offered for the top trims.
The  2023 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe doesn't come cheap, though. With a starting price  of more than $60,000, it costs almost $19,000 more than the non-hybrid Grand  Cherokee. That puts it in league with more luxurious PHEV SUVs such as the BMW  X5 xDrive45e and Volvo XC60 Recharge. Meanwhile, non-luxury PHEVs like the Kia  Sorento cost significantly less. But if you intend to do any off-roading, the  Grand Cherokee 4xe is the best choice of the bunch. Among  the six trim levels, we think you'll get the most value by sticking with the  base 4xe version of the SUV. It's  equipped like a Grand Cherokee Limited, so it has appealing wheels and leather  seats.

There are four new exterior colors, and enhancements have been made to reduce noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) for a quieter, more comfortable ride. A bland but otherwise utterly capable and perfectly useful SUV. Acura may be late to the SUV party, but it's decided to come dressed to the nines with a uniquely transformable interior wrapped in an angularly attractive skin supported by a four-wheel independent suspension and 17-inch alloy wheels. With its standard 240-horsepower 3.5-liter VTEC V6 (which meets ULEV regulations nationwide) and electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission, the MDX delivers better performance than many of its competitors. With an estimated EPA rating of 17 city and 23 highway, the MDX is also one of the most fuel-efficient SUVs in its class. Power travels to the wheels through Acura's Variable Torque Management (VTM) full-time four-wheel-drive system, which uses sensors to determine the vehicle's dynamic position and transfers engine torque to the wheels with the most grip. Unlike conventional automatic 4WD systems, Acura's proactively distributes engine torque during acceleration before wheel slip occurs. Unlike a Mercedes ML320, the MDX doesn't have a 4WD-low gear range, and the trailer towing capacity is low (at 3,500 pounds) for its class.In terms of appearance, the MDX includes Acura's signature pentagon grille, clean headlamp treatment and sharply chiseled front fascia, but with a muscular look appropriate to an SUV. Some of us find the bulky nose a bit off-putting, but from most viewpoints, the MDX is quite a looker. We like to think of it as a luxury off-road minivan that you can take through the brush all day, and the valet will still front-line it for you when you reach Spago for lunch.Inside, the MDX features second- and third-row seats that split and fold flat into the floor, creating an interior that can be easily reconfigured from seven-passenger hauler (though we wouldn't recommend trying to cram adults into the third row) to a flat-floor Home Depot runner in a matter of seconds. Large, flowing shapes dominate the instrument panel and center console, which is highlighted by woodgrained trim. The MDX comes with a comprehensive list of standard equipment, including leather seating surfaces (on first- and second-row seats), eight-way power and heated front seats, side airbags for front passengers, keyless entry, power moonroof, automatic climate control and a multi-function digital trip computer. Opt for the Touring Model and the front seat positions become linked to the key fob remotes, plus you get a 200-watt Acura/Bose stereo with in-dash six-disc CD changer as well as a handy roof rack. An optional DVD navigation system, mapped for all the 48 contiguous states, is also available.Like most other Acuras, and Hondas, for that matter, the MDX is meticulously engineered to serve a specific purpose, much like a good set of Craftsman tools. There is no doubt that this attribute is attractive, as evidenced by Honda's sales successes over the years. But the MDX is not given to whimsy or flair.

That's where the Silverado 2500HD comes in. Many people need the extra towing and payload capacity the 2500HD offers without having to move up to the 3500HD model. And in many cases, some people just simply want a larger and more powerful truck to drive around.  The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD's towing capacity maxes out at around 18,500 pounds when properly equipped, and it can carry close to 4,0000 pounds of cargo in its bed with the right configuration. These impressive numbers are in part thanks to the truck's powerful gasoline and turbodiesel engines. Chevy also offers the 2500HD in regular-, double- and crew-cab body styles, plus standard or long bed lengths, to further suit your particular needs. To help make towing easier, the Silverado 2500HD offers the Advanced Trailering System and a mobile app that provides custom trailering profiles, pre-departure checklists, trailer lighting diagnostics and more. The Silverado can also be equipped with eight cameras that provide 15 parking, driving and hitch viewpoints. Updates for the 2022 model year are minimal, but Chevrolet did make the handy Multi-Flex tailgate available on all trim levels. The Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD provides the power and capability you'd expect from a heavy-duty truck and a roomy and comfortable cabin. One of the truck's main drawbacks, though, is its interior. When compared to the Ford F-250 Super Duty or Ram 2500, the design looks dated, the material quality is lacking, and its tech is subpar. Despite that, we like the Silverado 2500HD and think it's a solid choice for people in the market for a heavy-duty truck. If you need a truck that's able to get the job done without many niceties, the WT or Custom trim should suffice. But if you want more than just basic features and the ability to add options and packages, the LT trim is the way to go.

Larger wheels and brakes are part of the engine upgrade. Two-stage front airbags, reduced steering effort, a Cold Weather package and Dynamic Brake Control round out the major changes for 2001. If you've got the bucks, this is unequivocally the best sedan in the entry-luxury category. In typical BMW fashion, the 3 Series lineup is being introduced in stages. The first models to change were the sedans, followed by the coupes, the convertible, and the wagon. This allows BMW to maintain customer interest in their best-selling platform over the course of several years.Sedan buyers can choose from an upgraded 2.5-liter inline six (models with this powerplant will now use the numerical designation of 325) that now makes 184 horsepower, or a new-for-2001 3.0-liter inline six (330 models). The latter engine, which debuted in the X5 3.0i, replaces the 2.8-liter engine across BMW's entire product line. Bumping horsepower and torque from the former engine's 193 and 206, respectively, to 225 and 214 in the 3.0-liter adds some noticeable punch to the 3 Series and helps keep it ahead of rivals like the Audi A4 and new Lexus IS 300.Riding on the same platform, the 3 Series sedans, coupes and convertible receive a standard five-speed manual transmission, a sport-tuned suspension, and ventilated front and rear disc brakes. Two versions of the coupe are available: the 325Ci, with the aforementioned 2.5-liter inline six, and the 330Ci with the more powerful 3.0-liter engine, larger brakes and standard 17-inch wheels. The more powerful 330 coupe reaches 60 from zero in just 6.4 seconds and features a broad torque band. Both engines meet low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards. A five-speed Steptronic automanual transmission is available for those who don't want to shift their own gears.Another new option for 2001 is all-wheel drive. Derived from the all-wheel-drive system found in the X5, ""xi"" models split 38 percent of the engine's power to the front wheels and 62 percent to the rear. The AWD package also includes a 0.7-inch increase in ride height and is available on both 325 and 330 sedans as well as the 325 wagon.If you opt for the 325Ci convertible, you'll have to lower the top manually unless you pop the extra cash for the power top, but 330Ci consumers get this perk standard. All convertibles come with a glass rear window and rollover protection. Wagon buyers will appreciate the touring models standard roof rack and rear window wiper, but, as with the sedan, don't expect to carry full-sized adults in the backseat for long periods of time.Safety equipment on all 3 Series models includes All-Season Traction (AST) and Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), along with dual front airbags, door-mounted side airbags and BMW's patented Head Protection System (S). New for 2001 is Dynamic Brake Control, which reinforces the driver's effort during emergency braking. Rear side airbags and xenon headlights remain optional.With the arrival of all-wheel drive and more powerful inline six cylinders, only one 3 Series model still offers superior performance; the all-new M3.",Inline 6 cylinder ,157," 175 lb-ft @ 3,500 ",, 5-speed manual

For example, a properly equipped Ford  F-150 can tow up to 14,000 pounds. But what happens when you need to tow  heavier trailers? That's when you step up to the heavy-duty truck class, and  you can't do much better than the burly 2022 Ford F-450 Super Duty. 
In  fifth-wheel trailer configurations, the F-450 can tow up to 37,000 pounds  (about as heavy as a loaded school bus), thanks to a potent turbodiesel engine  that cranks out a jaw-dropping 1,050 lb-ft of torque. But in addition to having  the muscle of a serious work truck, the F-450 also has the smarts and  refinement to appeal to a wider audience. At the high end of the lineup, you  can get a positively luxurious truck with amenities we're used to seeing from  BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
For  2022, the higher-trimmed F-450 models gain the new Sync 4 infotainment system  along with a striking 12-inch touchscreen. Besides giving the cabin a modern, tech-forward  appearance, it includes over-the-air updates and an upgraded voice activation  system capable of recognizing natural speech. 
Even  without the new infotainment upgrade, the 2022 F-450 is a solid alternative to  the equally capable Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD and Ram 3500. The F-450 is a bit  more expensive than those rivals, but we're confident demanding truck buyers  will find the added cost worth it. We  recommend the XLT trim if you're seeking a work-focused heavy-duty truck. The inclusion of an upgraded  infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, along with the  Co-Pilot360 suite of safety features, give it a considerable edge over the base  XL model.

Rounding out the 2001 changes are minor interior updates and a horsepower upgrade to the 7.3-liter diesel engine. Rugged looking and comfortable, the capable F-Series Super Duty deserves consideration from those looking for a commercial-grade truck. Commercial use is one of the fastest growing segments in the expanding truck market. With its F-Series Super Duty trucks, Ford is aiming squarely at fulfilling this segment's demand.The Super Duty trucks are built on a separate platform from the smaller F-150. Bigger, stronger and more robust, they are meant to perform feats the F-150 isn't capable of. The maximum GVWR for the F-150 is about 7,700 pounds, whereas the Super Duty starts at 8,500 pounds.The main mission here is towing and hauling. To provide the necessary grunt, Ford offers three different engines. The gasoline engines are a Triton 5.4-liter V8 and a 6.8-liter V10. The V8 generates 260 horsepower at 4,500 and 350 pound-feet of torque at 2,500 rpm. The V10 generates 310 horsepower at 4,250 and 425 lb-ft of torque at 3,250 rpm. A 7.3-liter turbodiesel V8 is also available, and it makes 250 horsepower and a dominating 505 lb-ft of torque (with the automatic transmission). All of these engines can be equipped with either an automatic or manual transmission.To better match your needs, the Super Duty comes in Regular Cab, SuperCab, and Crew Cab styles. The overall look is much more aggressive than the standard F-150, and its bigger dimensions allow Ford to use larger cabs without compromising load space. SuperCab models have small rear-opening doors, while the Super Duty Crew Cab has four full-size swing-out doors. A variety of optional equipment is available, including electronic shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive, a heavy-duty suspension package and manually telescoping trailer-towing mirrors.Inside, the roomy cabs have large, comfortable seats and generous seat-track travel. Five or six adults can ride inside with little problem. In addition, there are many interior convenience features designed for today's stylish business owners. For example, a fold-down armrest and utility bin is designed to house a portable fax machine or laptop computer. For owners who don't want to skimp on luxury, leather seating is available on Lariat models.Given their size, the F-250 and F-350 Super Duty trucks maintain a confident on- and off-road feel. They feature updated power steering systems and enhanced suspension components to improve vehicle ride, handling, responsiveness, and maneuverability. Just don't mistake them for cars. The Super Duty vehicles are true trucks and ride harshly when not towing or hauling loads. Parking a Super Duty ranges from tedious (a mall parking lot) to impossible (some home garages and underground parking lots).The Super Duty isn't for everyone. Pricing on a diesel-equipped Crew Cab can approach $40,000.

The 2001 Toyota Prius is currently the best hybrid on the market. Commend Toyota for taking the gasoline/electric hybrid one step further than Honda did when it released the two-seat Insight last year. The new Prius, though it gives up ultimate fuel economy for increased utility, holds five passengers and a good bit of cargo, meaning it functions as a useable family car.On sale in Japan since 1997, Toyota is keen on pointing out that Prius, and not Insight, was the first mass-produced gas/electric hybrid vehicle in the world. The company held off on introducing the model to U.S. customers until it could gauge consumer interest and boost power levels.An all-aluminum 1.5-liter gasoline engine makes 70 horsepower at 4,500 rpm, 12 more than Japan-market models. Torque is less than robust, measuring a meager 82 foot-pounds at a rather high 4,200 rpm. Variable valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i) helps maximize engine efficiency while minimizing emissions, and power is put to the ground via a continuously variable transmission driving the front wheels. With a curb weight of 2,765 pounds, we're thinking Prius is for use primarily in the city and not for blitzkrieg runs to Vegas.Like the engine, the sealed nickel-metal hydride battery pack powering the supplementary electric motor has been boosted 20 percent to 25 kilowatts (kW), resulting in 34 supplementary horsepower. Lighter than Japan-market batteries, U.S. spec power packs are also smaller, providing increased cargo area in the trunk, amounting to 11.8 cubic feet of space. Regenerative antilock brakes recharge the battery pack with each use, and if the electrical power completely depletes, the gas engine will help energize them.Driven with care, Prius will achieve 52 mpg in the city and 45 on the highway while meeting SULEV emissions standards, according to the EPA. With its 11.9-gallon gas tank, that gives the car a maximum city range of just over 600 miles.A single model is available, loaded with amenities like air conditioning, remote keyless entry, cassette stereo, power windows/locks/mirrors, height-adjustable front seats, and 14-inch alloy wheels.Gauges and controls are located in the center of the dashboard, like in Toyota's goofy Echo subcompact, to make Prius easy to configure for multiple world markets. Thanks to a tall stance, seating is upright with plenty of head- and foot room. Toyota likes to refer to Prius as a ""real car,"" intimating that Honda's hybrid Insight is not a real car. If the definition of ""real"" is capacity for more than two people and 10 cubic feet of stuff, then they're not fibbing.Whatever the case may be, it is obvious that hybrids are meeting with acceptance in the court of public opinion. Like Insight, Prius offers a viable alternative to gasoline power plants without the limitations posed by electric-only cars like the GM EV1.

Value  is one of the QX50's strengths. It's one of the most affordable models in the  small luxury SUV segment yet offers a generous number of standard features.  Higher trims are also reasonably priced. Its luxurious cabin is spacious for passengers  and there is plenty of cargo room.

There  is a lot to like about the QX50, but it falls short in some important  categories. The combination of the variable compression VC-Turbo engine and  continuously variable automatic transmission provides inconsistent power  delivery and lacks the refinement found in most rivals. Acceleration is pretty  quick but it's slow to start, and its real-world fuel economy is disappointing.  The dated-looking dual-screen infotainment system is a big letdown in an  otherwise elegant and well-built interior. Other affordable rivals like the  Lincoln Corsair and Acura RDX are more well-rounded SUVs, while the Genesis GV70  is another compelling alternative.

For  a more in-depth review, check out our one-year long-term review of a  2019 Infiniti QX50 Essential. Infiniti has added a new infotainment system and  additional advanced driver aids since then, but not much else has changed,  including the powertrain. We liked its styling, driver assist tech, and cargo  and passenger room but didn't care for the performance of its engine or subpar  real-world fuel economy.  If  you don't mind its dark exterior trim and wheels (can be configured with any  exterior paint color), the new Sport trim strikes the best balance of features and price. In addition to everything  in the Luxe trim, you get premium leather upholstery, heated and cooled front  seats, a Bose audio system and a surround-view camera system.",Inline 4 cylinder ,473," 280 lb-ft @ 4,800 ",, Continuously variable-speed automatic 
Audi,audi a5,2020,audi a5 2020,"['Understated and classy interior', 'Strong overall performance', 'Plenty of standard and optional tech features']",['Limited interior storage'],4.7,"As  a luxury vehicle, the 2020 Audi A5 has a high bar to clear. It has to be  comfortable yet still provide a respectable amount of performance. You'll also  expect plenty of the latest technology features, an abundance of interior  refinement, and styling that stands out in a sea of Hondas and Toyotas.  Pleasingly, the A5 has no problem getting all of this right. 
For  2020, Audi continues to sell the A5 in coupe, convertible and four-door  hatchback body styles. The exterior styling is a little different this year,  with a more angular grille and larger air inlets. Inside, there's a new  infotainment system that includes  a large 10.1-inch high-resolution touchscreen. On some of its other models,  Audi has also added a secondary screen for the climate controls, but we're glad the A5 has stuck with its classic button-based system since it's a lot easier  to use.
The  A5 is a pleasure to drive, whether you're commuting to work or touring the  countryside on vacation. It also stakes out an interesting middle ground  between its closest rivals: the BMW 4 Series and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The  4 Series is a little sportier and the C-Class is a little more prestigious.  Want the best mix of both aspects? Pick the A5.  The Premium Plus trim strikes a good  balance of features and price. You get more of the features you'll likely want  on a luxury car plus additional safety features. As a bonus, you can add more  options without having to go all-in with the top Prestige model.",Inline 4 cylinder ,550," 273 lb-ft @ 1,600 ",, 7-speed automated manual

Cheap interior plastics.'],4.7,"Chevrolet dumps a 305-horsepower version of the Corvette's V8 engine under a new front end, adds standard four-wheel disc brakes on all models, adds a couple of new colors, makes second-generation airbags standard and revises trim levels. The midyear SS package makes 320 horsepower. ""From the country that invented rock n' roll,"" claimed the advertisements for this Quebec, Canada-built sport coupe when it was redesigned in 1993.  A small technicality, we suppose, but there are no technicalities when it comes to the Camaro's performance abilities, particularly in Z28 or SS guise.  These Camaros are blazingly quick, hold the road tenaciously, cost less than the average price of a new car in this country (Z28, at least), and get decent gas mileage when they're not being hammered along a twisty two-lane road.For 1998, more power and speed are on tap.  The Z28 gets a detuned Corvette LS1 engine that makes 305 horsepower and 335 foot-pounds of torque.  Base Camaros aren't ignored this year either.  Bottom rung models have standard four-wheel disc brakes for 1998.  All Camaros get a standard Pass-Key II theft deterrent system, new front styling, body-colored door handles, and two new color possibilities (Sport Gold and Navy Blue).Trim levels and styling detail have been revised for 1998.  For some unknown reason, the RS model disappears, but all of its Batmobile aero trickery is available on base and Z28 models equipped with the Sport Appearance Package.  The SS model continues, but with interim availability during the model year.  All Z28 models get a black roof treatment; base models have a body-colored roof.  White leather is available inside all Camaros, and last year's Flame Red interior is now red accent only.Continuing from last year is the base Camaro engine, a 3800 Series II V6 which makes 200 horsepower.  That's 45 more ponies than Ford's Mustang V6 can produce.  Phased in during the 1995 model year, the 3800 V6 can be mated to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission.  With a manual, this powerplant gets the Camaro to 60 mph nearly as quickly as a Ford Mustang GT.  In fact, the existence of this motor makes a strong argument for avoiding the higher insurance rates and prices of the Z28.  An optional Performance Handling Package puts bigger tires, alloy wheels, tighter steering, and a limited-slip differential on the V6 Camaro.From a bang-for-the-buck standpoint, the Z28 is unbeatable.  The SS version of the Z28 makes 320 horsepower (327 with the optional exhaust) thanks to a big air scoop on the hood that forces cool air into the engine, but we question the added cost of the SS package when the power gain is negligible.  SLP Engineering, known for working magic with GM's F-bodies since the late '80s, does the conversion work for the Z28 SS.  See your dealer for details.  The interior of the Camaro is functional, if not slightly garish.  The Camaro holds a respectable amount of gear in the cargo hold (more than 33 cubic feet of space with the generally useless rear seats folded down), and airbags and antilock brakes are standard.  More mature drivers can order traction control, but that option defeats some of the fun of Chevy's ponycar: smoky, adolescent burnouts that leave the drivers behind choking on charred Goodyears.",V6 cylinder ,92," 225 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual 
Toyota,toyota corolla,2003,toyota corolla 2003,"['Refined and roomy interior, spunky engine, tight build quality.']","['Unless you count the Matrix, pricing on the high end of the economy sedan market.']",4.6,"Toyota's Corolla is all-new for 2003. Far removed from the original Corolla, this one is the biggest yet. It's also more luxurious. The return is more interior room, a more substantial feel and changes aimed at fixing the previous model's shortcomings. Though pricing has increased, Toyota has made more equipment standard in the hopes of keeping the Corolla's reputation for value intact. With sportier styling, a larger interior, an improved drivetrain and added standard equipment, the 2003 Corolla will find success. Toyota's venerable Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the best-selling nameplate in the history of automobiles.Recent competition, however, has outclassed the Corolla. So for 2003, Toyota's baked up an all-new model to serve the buying public better. The new Corolla is bigger, more powerful and more luxurious than the model it replaces.More power comes in the form of a 130- 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine. Thanks to a variable valve timing system (Toyota's VVT-i), this engine provides good acceleration anywhere in the rev range. It's also clean enough to allow the car to earn ULEV emissions status. Transmission choices are either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. Last year's doggy three-speed automatic has been mercifully removed from the lineup.Trim levels continue to be the base CE, the better-equipped LE and the sporty S. More features are standard this year, and even the lowly CE comes with air conditioning with micron filtration, a CD player, power steering, power mirrors, an outside temperature gauge, 60/40 split-folding rear seats and 15-inch wheels.The S model includes ""sporty"" trim such as body-color rocker panels and door handles, smoked headlights, foglights, special gauges and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Go with the LE to gain fake-wood trim, a vertical seat height adjuster (also on the S) and remote keyless entry. Options include upgraded audio systems, ABS, side airbags, cruise control, leather seating and a sunroof.Inside the cabin, Toyota has made a number of changes to improve comfort. Interior volume is up, and so is roominess. The controls are easier to reach and have a higher-quality feel to them. Though some legroom has been sacrificed in the translation to higher seating positions within the Corolla, other key passenger measurements have all been increased. Even trunk space is up to 13.6 cubic feet.Much of this newfound room is due to the car's larger size. Curb weight has increased, but it's only about 50 pounds more. Toyota says the Corolla has a more substantial feel, and ride quality is said to be both firmer and more comfortable. The front suspension is MacPherson struts as before, while the rear changes to torsion beam.All of these updates should only add to what are already Corolla's strengths: a reputation for reliability and a strong resale value. This new 2003 version, with sportier styling, a larger interior, an improved drivetrain and added standard equipment, can only ensure the model's continued success.",Inline 4 cylinder ,190," 125 lb-ft @ 4,200 ",, 5-speed manual

A large cabin, excellent crash test scores, a reputation for reliability and a high resale value make this our favorite minivan on the market. The second-generation Honda Odyssey is only a year old, and already it is recognized as the new minivan benchmark. It's powered by a 3.5-liter 24-valve VTEC V6 that produces up to 210 horsepower and 229 pound-feet of torque, according to Honda. To get that kind of power requires 91-octane, but with 87-octane fuel, the engine makes 205 horses and 217 lb-ft of torque. The V6 is based on the Accord's 3.0-liter engine but it offers more power, since the Odyssey's got a bit of extra girth.The base model LX includes such standard fare as dual sliding doors, power windows (including power rear-vent windows), power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, a theft-deterrent system, two 12-volt power outlets, front and rear air conditioning, antilock brakes and, of course, the 3.5-liter V6 engine. The EX features such niceties as dual power-sliding doors, body-colored door handles, a roof rack, keyless remote, an eight-way power driver's seat, alloy wheels, traction control, a CD player and steering-wheel-mounted radio controls. Sitting on a four-wheel independent suspension, a first in the minivan segment, the Odyssey is supported comfortably and keeps the driver in touch with the road. Combined with the Odyssey's wide track, the suspension adds a nimble feel. Body roll around corners is well-damped for a vehicle of this height. The most unique Odyssey feature continues to be its hideaway, or ""magic"" seat. With a minimum of effort and the use of one set of hands only, the rear seat can be folded out of sight and be flush with the floor in a matter of seconds. The second-row seats are convertible and can be used as separate captain's chairs or as a bench. A minivan would not be complete without safety features, and the Odyssey comes with its share. All seven seats have headrests and three-point seatbelts, both firsts in the minivan market. ABS and an Electronic Brakeforce Distribution system (EBD) are also standard. EBD senses the placement and amount of cargo, then compensates for it during hard braking to avoid rear-wheel lockup. With terrific crash test scores, innovative features, and nice power to boot -- the Honda Odyssey might just be the ultimate family vehicle.",V6 cylinder ,240," 229 lb-ft @ 4,300 ",, 4-speed automatic

After last year's complete redesign, 2000 sedans see only minor improvements. If you've got the bucks, this is unequivocally the best car in the entry-luxury category. BMWs are all about performance.  Since the introduction of the 1600-02 in 1966, legions of fans have purchased this Munich-based company's smallest cars in the search for a perfect balance of practicality and power.  During the last two decades, the marque has also come to the attention of those looking for prestige.  This last group of admirers has had a profound impact on the company's fortunes, making BMW the second-best-selling German manufacturer in the United States.Things have changed since 1966, though, including the name of BMW's smallest line of cars.  Since 1977, BMW has referred to these models as the 3 Series, and for 2000 this lineup of cars is undergoing its fourth major redesign.  In typical BMW fashion, the 3 Series lineup is being redesigned at a staggered pace.  This means that the first models to change were the sedans in 1999, followed by the coupes, the convertible and all-new wagon, and finally the wicked M3 performance coupe.  This allows BMW to extend the life of the design by stretching out introductions over the course of several years.  The previous E36 version had been in production since 1992.   Sedan buyers can choose from the 2.5-liter inline six (323 models) or the 2.8-liter inline six (328 models).  A five-speed Steptronic automanual transmission is optional this year.  Changes to the sedans for the millennium include a new, optional radio-integrated navigation system that is less expensive and less comprehensive than the Onboard Navigation System currently offered by BMW, a climate-control system that automatically switches into recirculation mode when driving through polluted air, and a key memory feature that includes exterior mirror adjustments.  Fifteen-inch alloy wheels are now standard on the 323i, and an optional sport-premium package is available.For the 2000 model year, BMW's coupes steal the spotlight with a complete redesign of their own.  Sharing a platform with the 3 Series sedans, the coupes receive a standard five-speed manual transmission, a sport-tuned suspension, and ventilated front and rear disc brakes.  Two versions are available: the 323Ci, which has a 2.5-liter inline six that makes 170 horsepower at 5,500 rpm, and the 328Ci with a 2.8-liter inline six making 193 horsepower at 5,500 rpm.  Torque output on the 323Ci is 181 foot-pounds at 3,500 rpm.  The more powerful 328  coupe reaches 60 from zero in just 6.6 seconds and makes 206 foot-pounds of torque at 3,500 rpm.  Both engines meet Low-Emissions Vehicle (LEV) standards.  Sixteen-inch alloy wheels are standard on the coupes, but 17-inch alloys can be purchased as an option.  A five-speed Steptronic automanual transmission is also optional for those who don't want to shift their own gears.  Safety equipment on both coupes and sedans include All-Season Traction (AST) and Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), along with dual front airbags, door-mounted side airbags and BMW's patented Head Protection System (S).  Rear side airbags and Xenon headlights are optional. While many things have changed in the past 20 years, some things -- luckily -- have not.  BMW is still recognized as a marque of high quality and affluence.

Nothing more need be said about a Bronco than, ""This is one big truck.""  One of the bully boys of sport utilities, it's a favorite of celebrities, of adventurers--and of thousands of ordinary folks who like to feel they're in full command at the wheel, whether rolling down the Interstate or bumping and lurching through the underbrush.Chevrolet's latest Tahoe and the similar GMC Yukon now come in two body styles, but the Bronco suffices with just one: a three-door available in four trim levels: XL, XLT, XLT Sport and Eddie Bauer.  Three V8 powertrains are available: a 5.0-liter with a five-speed gearbox or four-speed automatic, or a 210-horsepower, 5.8-liter V8 that's equipped only with an automatic.  California-bound 5.8-liter engines are converted to mass airflow fuel metering and sequential fuel injection, to meet emissions standards.  All Broncos have part-time, dual-range four-wheel-drive.  Five-passenger seating is standard, with firm buckets up front, but a six-seat variation can be ordered. Headroom is massive, in an interior that looks exactly the same as an F-Series pickup truck.  That includes a column-mounted automatic-transmission gearshift and old-time front vent windows that actually open--a feature long since forgotten on most vehicles, but a welcome bonus on warm days.New this year is a trick turn signaling system first displayed on the 1995 GT90 show car.  Embedded in the side view mirror surfaces are turn signal indicators that motorists following the Bronco can see blinking, but the driver cannot.  The system doesn't obstruct the driver's view through or use of the mirrors, day or night.  The system is standard on the Bronco XLT Sport, optional on XLT and Eddie Bauer models.Other improvements include a new bumper designed to aid engine cooling, an improved hub locking system, and the deletion of the anti-theft system.  XL and XLT models get black interior trimmings while the Eddie Bauer model is saddled with woodgrain trim inside.  The accent color on the Eddie Bauer changes to a new shade of tan for 1996.Despite its many merits, Ford's Explorer looks tame, if not puny, next to a Bronco.  Vehicles don't come much sturdier.  Anyone who goes for serious trucking can't help but put a Bronco near the head of the think-about-it list.

As part of that redesign,  the previous NX 300h hybrid model was replaced with a new-and-improved NX 350h.  Riding on the same new platform as the gas-powered NX 350 and NX 250, the NX  350h boasts a four-cylinder gas engine and dual-electric motor combo that's  good for a combined 239 horsepower.  
Because  it was just introduced last year, the NX 350h carries over with no significant  changes for 2023. The second-generation NX features sleeker exterior styling  and a lower center of gravity, which improves its driving experience. Inside,  the entire cabin grows slightly, adding headroom and legroom for passengers and  a few extra cubic feet in back for cargo. The most appreciable change, however,  might be the updated infotainment system, which loses the previous model's  clunky joystick controller in favor of a touchscreen. 
If  fuel economy is among your top priorities, the 2023 Lexus NX 350h won't  disappoint. The NX hybrid gets an EPA-estimated 39 mpg combined (41 city/37  highway), which is excellent for a small SUV. That efficiency doesn't come at  the price of lackluster performance either. Lexus estimates the NX 350h can  scoot to 60 mph in a respectable 7.2 seconds. 
As  a conventional hybrid, the NX 350h faces little direct competition. Most other  premium small SUVs in the class offer mild hybrid options with less electrical  assistance or plug-in hybrid variants, which are a good deal more expensive.  It's not perfect, but it's a worthy choice if you're looking for a luxurious  and fuel-efficient small crossover. Only  one trim level is offered for the NX 350h, but there are many stand-alone  options and packages available to tailor your hybrid SUV to your needs.

Trim levels range from the practical XL through the well-trimmed XLT which now has a color-keyed grille, bumpers, wheel lip moldings, and door handles.With the optional 4.0-liter V6 engine, in particular, acceleration is impressively brisk, whether from a standstill or when merging and passing.  Automatic-transmission upshifts are crisp and barely noticed, with just a slight jolt under hard throttle, and downshifts deliver only slightly more harshness.  Push-button four-wheel-drive, if installed, is a snap to use.Well-controlled overall, with good steering feedback, Rangers handle easily, corner capably, maneuver neatly, and stay reasonably stable on curves.  Occupants aren't likely to complain about the ride, either, though it can grow bouncy around town.

An optional passenger side airbag is available, and it can be disabled with the flick of a switch in the event that a child safety seat is installed in the truck.  The Ranger is also the only small truck to be available with a five-speed automatic transmission.  Ford claims that the five-speed automatic allows better acceleration, trailering, and hill climbing by their capable Ranger.Ford lost its deathgrip on the small truck segment when Dodge introduced the outstanding Dakota in 1997.  In a retaliatory effort, Ford gave the 1998 Ranger an unneeded facelift that we think renders the truck less attractive than before.  With that facelift came an increase in wheelbase, a larger base engine, a new suspension, rack-and-pinion steering and a four-door model.  Also new for 1998 was the presence of an electric model.  Marketed primarily to fleets, the electric Ranger boasts a top speed of 75 mph and a 700-lb. payload.  Ford has had the best-selling small trucks in the country for years.  We think it's because Rangers are all truck, with few pretensions toward any other identity yet capable of being loaded with gadgets like a luxury auto.  Fun to drive, sharp looking, and well built, they deliver a solid compact-pickup experience.

Two-wheel drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated at 142-horsepower. Tacoma 4x4s earn a 150-horspower, 2.7-liter four. Toyota claims that its four-cylinder engines are comparable to V6s from competitors. If those won't suffice, however, consider the V6 option: a DOHC, 24-valve unit that whips out 190 horses and 220 foot-pounds of torque. With V6 power, borrowed from the now defunct T100, this compact pickup can tow up to 5,000 pounds and soundly trounce most factory sport trucks in the stoplight dragrace.All Tacomas have front coil springs instead of the former torsion bars, but 4x4s feature longer suspension travel to improve ride/handling qualities.

Toyota,toyota camry,2002,toyota camry 2002,"['Roomy, powerful engines, plenty of safety and luxury features.']","['High prices for XLE, costly premium features.']",4.4,"One of America's favorite cars is all new this year. Design goals for the 2002 Toyota Camry included larger interior packaging, reduced noise, more advanced safety features, better driving dynamics and, of course, a new standard of value. Toyota has succeeded in building a better mousetrap -- it's got more interior space, a more powerful base engine and a bevy of premium features for buyers willing to pay extra. If you ever need confirmation that Americans are completely different from Europeans (besides German tourists' propensity for wearing black socks and shorts), look no further than the Toyota Camry. Here is a car that, for the past four years, has been the best-selling car in America and a near definition of the American passenger car. In Europe, Camry sales barely register.The Camry's success in the U.S. lies in its ability to sensibly fulfill the needs of consumers seeking a roomy vehicle that sets a benchmark in quality, reliability and value. For 2002, the Camry enters its fifth generation with an all-new design, and Toyota has done everything within its power to make sure the Camry continues its success.One question remains: How do you improve on a bestseller? Simple -- give Americans more of what they like. And the engineers at Toyota have done just that, simultaneously retaining all the things that make a Camry great while imbuing it with a new feel.We Americans like a lot of room for our families and gear. Therefore, the Camry's wheelbase has been lengthened by 2 inches, resulting in a more spacious interior and 1.5 more inches of legroom for rear seaters. The trunk is bigger, too, expanding to hold a maximum of 16.7 cubic feet of cargo.Outside, the previous Camry's clean and inoffensive (many people would add ""bland"") styling has been updated with an aggressive grille and sharp-cut headlamps. The cabin and doors feature sleek character lines, connected to a rear integrated bumper that is complemented with new jewel-like tail lamps. Aerodynamic drag is reduced, and sound deadening has been improved for reduced interior noise.Few Americans would say that their cars have too much horsepower. So for 2002, Toyota has updated the popular 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine to produce 157 horsepower and 162 lb-ft of torque, besting the previous engine's numbers by 24 and 14, respectively.Remaining virtually the same is the optional 192-horsepower 3.0-liter V6. It now achieves ULEV certification, as does the 2.4-liter. Transferring power to the front wheels for both engines is a smoother shifting electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission or a five-speed manual (four-cylinder only).Each engine is available with the three different trim levels this year: LE, SE and XLE. Last year's entry-level CE is replaced by the LE, which remains the core volume model but with a higher level of standard equipment, including power windows, mirrors and locks; air conditioning with particulate filtration; cruise control; and an ambient temperature gauge.The XLE gets power driver and passenger seats, heated outside mirrors, a premium JBL audio system, climate control with rear-seat vents, steering wheel-mounted controls, a compass in the electrochromic mirror, a rear sunshade and 16-inch wheels. The new SE grade combines distinctive and sportier styling elements with chassis tuning that delivers a firmer ride, enhanced steering and nimble handling.Optional for all V6 models is a Vehicle Skid Control (VSC) that corrects understeer and oversteer deviancy. Side and, for the first time, side curtain airbags for front and rear passengers are also available. Other add-ons to keep the Camry up-to-date include Toyota's excellent navigation system and an in-dash six-disc CD changer. Fully loaded, a top-of-the-line Camry XLE is a few hundred dollars more than a stripped-down Lexus ES 300. Unless your day depends on being the owner of a luxury marque car with real wood trim, we can't imagine that anyone would forego the Camry.The all-new Camry is an enticing pick for 2002. It remains loyal to its original mission while still offering more features and better driving enjoyment. Unless Americans start wearing black socks with shorts, the Camry should retain its title as the best-selling car for another year.",Inline 4 cylinder ,190," 162 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual

Audi adds an oil level sensor to the A8 and an Office Package consisting of an electrically folding desk and minibar/cold storage for the rear seat is added to the options list. While the A8 and A8 L aren't top performers in the super-luxury sedan segment, their well-appointed cabins and all-wheel drive make them feasible alternatives to offerings from BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. The A8, introduced to the US in 1996 as a 1997 model, is aging gracefully. Sporting senior A4 styling, sumptuous interior appointments, and the revolutionary Audi Space Frame (ASF), the A8 is lighter, tighter and more responsive than many other super-luxury competitors.Employing lightweight aluminum-alloy construction, ASF is designed to provide superior structural rigidity, improved handling and responsiveness, better fuel efficiency and easier recycling.  Gas-filled shocks, beefed-up frame reinforcement, and lightweight suspension components further contribute to ride comfort and handling in the A8.The A8 L offers an extended wheelbase, with more head-, shoulder- and legroom for rear occupants. It also includes Electronic Stability Program (ESP), a global positioning Audi Navigation System, and heated ""comfort"" front and rear seats. The A8 4.2 quattro, which has all-wheel drive and a 310-horsepower, 4.2-liter, twin-cam aluminum-alloy V8 engine under the hood, sports 40 valves (five per cylinder) and makes peak torque of 302 foot-pounds between 3,000 and 4,000 rpm.Safety is not ignored in the A8. Dual front airbags are supplemented by side airbags tucked into the front seats. Rear passengers also get side airbags, mounted to the seat rather than the door panel.  Audi's Sideguard head airbag system consists of inflatable curtain airbags installed in the headliner along each side of the car, which cover the windows in the event of an accident and remain inflated for five seconds to protect the head in case the vehicle rolls over.Audi's vaunted quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard.  Additionally, Electronic Differential Locking (EDL) provides low-speed traction control operating through the standard antilock braking system (ABS).  Electronic Braking-Pressure Distribution (EBD) is included with the ABS system, and ensures that maximum braking capacity can be utilized whenever needed, regardless of road or load conditions.Inside, drivers will find an interior slathered in real wood and Valcona leather upholstery. Front seats are power adjustable in 14 different ways, and a memory feature accommodates four different settings for the driver's seat, exterior mirrors, driver's headrest height and steering wheel position. The front passenger seat also gets a memory feature for 2001 and a multifunctional steering wheel with audio, telephone and Tiptronic controls is now standard on the A8. The steering wheel tilts out of the way when the key is removed from the ignition. The automatic dual-zone temperature controls employ two sunlight sensors to help maintain accuracy.Despite its rather expensive price tag, the A8's technological advances and long list of standard equipment should prove desirable enough to continue bringing BMW, Lexus and Benz intenders into Audi showrooms.",V8 cylinder ,185," 302 lb-ft @ 3,000 ",, 5-speed shiftable automatic

Smarter.'],"[""The bow tie boys weren't smart enough to figure out how to get a fourth-door installed on the extended cab (aka the Windstar effect).  The interior revision didn't go nearly as far as it should have in terms of design and materials.""]",4.3,"Chevrolet has redesigned the decade-old C/K pickup and given the truck a new name. Major structural, power, braking and interior enhancements characterize the new Silverado. Styling is evolutionary rather than revolutionary, inside and out. Imagine the pressure engineers and designers were under when they undertook the task of completely revising the best-selling model General Motors produces.  Success would insure that GM could continue to reap large benefits from a booming truck industry.  Failure would reduce market share, profits and credibility.  Making matters worse, the existing platform was already a hot seller.  How to fix something that wasn't broken?They started by asking Chevy truck customers what they wanted in a new full-size pickup.  More power, better handling, more interior room, better fuel economy and a stronger chassis were the answers.  What they most certainly did not want was cartoonish or sissified styling, like the Dodge and Ford stores were selling.So Chevrolet gave the customer what they asked for.  Looking at the new Silverado, some might be hard-pressed to discern differences between it and the old C/K model.  Inside the trucks look even more identical in appearance, unfortunately.  But under the skin, GM has served up a heaping pile of massive improvement.A new three-section frame is stiffer, lighter and easier to assemble than that of the C/K.  It contributes to better impact absorbing, a smoother ride and quieter interior noise volumes.  Payload capacity is up as well.  A new family of Vortec V8 engines makes more power and torque over a flatter curve, though the 4300 V6 and turbo-diesel 6.5-liter V8 carry over with minor enhancements.  Transmission modifications mean the gearchangers should prove more durable, and a tow-haul mode improves performance under heavy loads.Revised steering, suspension and braking systems make driving the Silverado a joy.  Four-wheel disc antilock brakes are standard, steering feel has been tightened up thanks in part to the inclusion of power rack-and-pinion gear on models under 6,400 GVWR, the turning circle is smaller and a wider rear track contributes to greater stability.  Optional is Adjustable Electronic Ride Control, the first selective damping system ever offered on a pickup.Inside Silverado buyers will find logically laid out switchgear, though the plastics still have the same Fisher Price feel to them as the knobs and panels in the previous truck.  The cabin is very roomy, particularly on extended cab models.  A standard third door on the latter makes entry and exit to the rear bench seat easy, and if front passengers are willing to sacrifice a bit of leg room, the back of the extended cab is actually quite comfortable.  Front seatbelts are mounted to the seats themselves so rear passengers don't need to chop through a web of fabric to get in and out.  Oddly, a fourth door is unavailable on the Silverado, a major oversight now that Dodge, Ford and Toyota all offer this added convenience.We've only been able to briefly skim over the major changes Chevrolet made to its full-sized truck in the space alloted here.  Electrical system improvements, changes to the manufacturing process and myriad minor modifications all mean the new Silverado is among the most technologically-advanced pickups on the market.  The bar has been raised with the introduction of the Chevy Silverado, and GM bean counters needn't worry about their bonuses at year's end.

Numb steering.'],4.1,"Two new exterior colors, one new interior color and automatic transmission enhancements. Believe it or not, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van lineup when the Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996.  The GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced in 1971, and sold steadily until they were discontinued. Competition and safety regulations had forced GM to redo the big vans in 1996 -- heck, since 1971 Ford had re-engineered the Club Wagon and Econoline twice!  To distinguish the new design, GMC rebadged the van Savana.Savana features flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard antilock brakes and dual airbags.  Front foot and legroom is adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of travel.  Rear heat ducts are standard, but for better warming (and cooling), an optional rear heating and air conditioning unit is available.  Front air conditioning is standard.  The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet and storage for items like CDs and cassettes.  Savana is available in 135- and 155-inch wheelbases, three weight series (1500, 2500 or 3500) and two (base SL and luxury SLE) trim levels. There is a choice of side-entry doors as well: a sliding door or a pair of 60/40 hinged doors.Inside the short-wheelbase Savana, you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the extended version provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume with the rear seats removed.  Up to 15 passengers can be seated within the longer van on as many as five bench seats.  Rear hinged doors open 180 degrees for easy loading and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened.  Gross vehicle weight ratings of up to 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase.The base engine is a Vortec 4300 V6 making 200 horsepower.  Optional motors include the GM family of V8's, ranging from the popular Vortec 5000 to the monster Vortec 7400.  Also available is a robust 6.5-liter turbo-diesel V8 good for 195 horsepower and 430 stump-pulling foot-pounds of torque.Automatic transmission refinements result in lower levels of vibration and noise.  These refinements include a two-piece transmission case that provides powertrain stiffness, software that compares engine/vehicle operating parameters and sets precise transmission line pressure, a deep oil pan which aids durability and fluid life, and an electrically controlled converter clutch which increases fuel economy.Two new exterior colors, Fernmist Green Metallic and Dark Bronzemist Metallic, and one new interior color, Medium Dark Pewter, are available for 1999.  Like most products in showrooms these days, the Savana's styling is rounded and bulbous, with a front end that mimics the corporate look carried by most of GM's truck family.

Rounding out the 2001 changes are minor interior updates and a horsepower upgrade for the 7.3-liter Power Stroke turbodiesel engine. Rugged looking and comfortable, the capable F-Series Super Duty deserves consideration from those looking for a commercial-grade truck. Commercial use is one of the fastest growing segments in the expanding truck market. With its F-Series Super Duty trucks, Ford is aiming squarely at fulfilling this segment's demand.The Super Duty trucks are built on a separate platform than the smaller F-150. Bigger, stronger and more robust, they are meant to perform feats the F-150 isn't capable of. The maximum GVWR for the F-150 is about 7,700 pounds, whereas the Super Duty starts at 8,500 pounds.The main mission here is towing and hauling. To provide the necessary grunt, Ford offers three different engines. The gasoline engines are a Triton 5.4-liter V8 and a 6.8-liter V10. The V8 generates 260 horsepower at 4,500 and 350 foot-pounds of torque at 2,500 rpm. The V10 generates 310 horsepower at 4,250 and 425 foot-pounds of torque at 3,250 rpm. A 7.3-liter turbodiesel V8 is also available, and it makes 250 horsepower and a dominating 505 foot-pounds of torque (with the automatic transmission). All of these engines can be equipped with either an automatic or manual transmission.To better match your needs, the Super Duty comes in Regular Cab, SuperCab, and Crew Cab styles. The overall look is much more aggressive than the standard F-150, and its bigger dimensions allow Ford to use larger cabs without compromising load space. SuperCab models have small rear-opening doors, while the Super Duty Crew Cab has four full-size swing-out doors. A variety of optional equipment is available, including electronic shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive, a heavy-duty suspension package and manually telescoping trailer-towing mirrors.Inside, the roomy cabs have large, comfortable seats and generous seat-track travel. Five or six adults can ride inside with little problem. In addition, there are many interior convenience features designed for today's stylish business owners. For example, a fold-down armrest and utility bin is designed to house a portable fax machine or laptop computer. For owners who don't want to skimp on luxury, leather seating is available on Lariat models.Given their size, the F-250 and F-350 Super Duty trucks maintain a confident on- and off-road feel. They feature updated power steering systems and enhanced suspension components to improve vehicle ride, handling, responsiveness, and maneuverability. Just don't mistake them for cars. The Super Duty vehicles are true trucks and ride harshly when not towing or hauling loads. Parking a Super Duty ranges from tedious (a mall parking lot) to impossible (some home garages and underground parking lots).The Super Duty isn't for everyone. Pricing on a diesel-equipped Crew Cab can approach $40,000.

Featuring an exclusive two-door hatchback body style, the new Si has a 160-horsepower engine. All 2002 Honda Civic sedans and coupes feature a revised steering box for improved driving feel, added sound insulation and slightly tweaked suspension tuning. There are also some smattering of interior storage and comfort upgrades this year. If you're shopping for a small car and you skip the redesigned 2002 Honda Civic, you're doing yourself a tremendous disservice. Who's your Daddy? That should be the 2002 Civic's advertising tagline. One of the most well-known and popular economy cars ever sold in America, the Civic continues to be one of the best choices in this segment after its redesign last year.For 2002, there are three main trim levels: DX, LX and EX. The DX trim includes a tilt steering wheel and an AM/FM four-speaker stereo, among other items. Mid-level LX comes with air conditioning (includes a micron air filter), power windows and locks, cruise control and a cassette deck. Top-of-the-line EX receives antilock brakes, a moonroof, 15-inch wheels and a CD player. There's also the natural gas-powered GX sedan, the high fuel-mileage HX coupe and the new Civic Si hatchback.DX and LX are powered by a 115-horsepower 1.7-liter four-cylinder engine and are mated to a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The engines in the GX, HX and EX are equipped with Honda's VTEC variable valve-timing system. VTEC allows the EX to make 127 horsepower. The miserly HX manages only 117 , but the reward is an EPA mileage estimate of 36/44 mpg city/highway. The HX and GX can be equipped with a continuously variable transmission and all of these engines meet ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) standards. Later in 2002, Honda is set to offer a gasoline/electric hybrid Civic showcasing technology developed for the Honda Insight.If it's power you are looking for, the Civic Si hatchback should suit you. The Si comes with the 160- 2.0-liter engine also found in the Acura RSX. The shifter for the close-ratio five-speed manual transmission is mounted rally-style on the center dashboard. Other features include standard rear disc brakes, a sport-tuned suspension, sport seats and special gauges. Regardless of the body style, the Civic earns excellent scores in government crash tests. Dual seatbelt pre-tensioners, dual-stage airbag inflators, three-point seatbelts for all five occupants and optional side airbags with a cutoff system that can detect a child or occupant out of position are all offered. ABS is offered, but only on EX, GX and Si trim.With the sedan and coupes, the driving experience isn't the most exciting to be found in this class. The suspension is tuned for a soft and comfortable ride, not necessarily performance. We also find the exterior styling to be rather dull. The interior is roomy and quiet, however, and this allows the Civic to be an excellent car for both commuting and long-distance trips.While there are certainly other economy cars out there you should take a look at, it's pretty hard to go wrong with the Civic.

SUVs are known for  their practicality but not so much for performance. The new 2020 BMW X4 M  attempts to blend both worlds with varying degrees of success.  With  up to 503 horsepower and tenacious grip, the X4 M certainly covers the sports  car part pretty well. But as a subcompact SUV with a coupe-like roofline,  utility is hampered by limited rear-seat headroom and a comparably small cargo  space. That said, it still offers much more convenience than a sport coupe or  sedan. It's also an intriguing choice among other SUVs in the class that  include the Alfa Romeo Stelvio, Mercedes-Benz AMG GLC 63 and Porsche Macan  Turbo. How does the X4 M drive?If  you've never thought about taking an SUV to a racetrack for some lapping  sessions, the 2020 X4 M might just change your mind. The turbocharged inline  six-cylinder engine makes gobs of power everywhere. It's mostly free of turbo  lag and absolutely devoid of power spikes all the way up to its 7,200- redline.Of  course, it's one thing to demolish straightaways and quite another to make it  around the next bend. But the X4 M Competition has that covered too. Traction,  aided by the Active M differential, is excellent, and X4 M even allows for a  little powersliding out of slower corners. The shifts from the eight-speed  gearbox are quick and authoritative. How comfortable is the X4 M?Taking  a step back from the performance side of things and ... well, there's really no  way to do that in this vehicle. The X4 M Competition is simply in attack mode  at all times. The ride, even in the poorly named Comfort setting, is fairly  stiff. And when the various engine, suspension and transmission settings have  been cranked up, the X4 M is intense, bordering on insane.How's the X4 M's interior?The  standard X4 is already a fairly nice place to be, and the X4 M adds suitably  sporty touches to match the exterior styling. In front of the driver is a thick  steering wheel, which will be familiar to many BMW owners. But this one has two  red preset buttons labeled M1 and M2 for quick access to preselected driving  modes. There's also an X4 M-specific digital gauge cluster. Although it's a bit treacherous for rear  passengers to get in and out — the swooping roofline is all too eager  to knock your noggin on the way in if you're not paying attention —  there's a sufficient amount of room in back once you're seated. There's a bit  less legroom than the average SUV in this segment, though it's not too  noticeable. Visibility is pretty compromised all around and especially out the  very narrow back window, which is more decorative than it is useful. How's the X4 M's storage?The  M's performance hasn't come at the expense of cargo space, which remains at  18.5 cubic feet of capacity behind the rear seats. That's still considerably  less than its X3 M sibling. The X4 M Competition still gets 40/20/40-split  folding rear seats, and the cargo area has handy sliding tie-downs for your stuff,  which will inevitably get tossed around once you start driving. There's a  useful amount of small-item storage as well, with bins deep enough to keep  things in place during spirited driving. We  recommend sticking with the standard X4  M since you only gain 30 horsepower with the Competition package upgrade.  Instead, we'd consider adding the Driving Assistance Plus package for the  adaptive cruise control and the Executive package for the added niceties.",Inline 6 cylinder ,115," 442 lb-ft @ 2,600 ",, 8-speed shiftable automatic

If the latest Sonata hinted at the direction the company was to take in the future, then the Accent is an in-your-face declaration from this Korean manufacturer that the days of selling shoddy, inept vehicles in the United States are over.  The Accent is one of the better subcompacts in today's market.We looked at an Accent sedan with automatic transmission.  The sticker price was just over $11,200, and that bottom line included the autobox, dual airbags, cassette stereo, power steering and side impact protection that meets 1997 standards.  Air conditioning would add another $900.In contrast, a similarly-equipped Geo Metro sedan would run $10,960.  However, the Metro doesn't come standard with such niceties as rear window defogger, cargo area lighting, remote releases for the fuel door and trunk, or digital clock.  Additionally, the Accent benefits from single-piece side stampings, which contribute to stiffer body rigidity, and a 92 horsepower engine that far outranks the top-line 70 horse motor provided in the Geo.  Is the Hyundai worth the additional money?  Absolutely!  The Metro feels a bit roomier, but the Accent is so much better that there really is no comparison.Aside from the putrid seat fabrics, childish paint schemes and funky smell associated with all new Hyundais, we like the Accent quite a bit.  It's a great set of budget wheels, without the budget engineering or the budget equipment levels.  Check this one out.",Inline 4 cylinder ,310," 97 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual

The TRD Off-Road package is now available on Access Cabs with a V8 engine, while models equipped with a V6 receive an upgraded alternator. A note-pad holder is now optional on SR5 and Limited, while Base regular cab trucks lose their standard cassette player. Two new colors are available, filling three slots left vacant by old colors that have been discontinued. The 2001 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup suited more for the general consumer than for commercial use. As the maker of America's best-selling sedan, it must have been frustrating for Toyota to learn that trucks are now outselling cars in this country, especially since the closest thing to a full-size pickup truck previously offered by Toyota was the poorly received T100. But the company learns from its mistakes, and went to work building a proper workhorse for American consumers.With last year's introduction of the Tundra, Toyota has finally crafted a full-fledged, maximum-sized pickup, capable of running with the big dogs on several fronts. Topping its pedigree is an available 4.7-liter, I-Force V8 engine lifted directly from the Land Cruiser/LX 470 sport utility twins. This smooth-revving and ultra-refined power plant makes 245 horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque and is available only with a four-speed automatic transmission. Payload capacity is 2,000 pounds and towing capacities for the V8 start at 5,000 pounds (it goes up to 7,000 pounds with an optional tow package). A 3.4-liter, dual overhead-cam V6, making 190 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque, is standard on regular-cab Tundras, and may be mated to either a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission. Toyota has failed, in some regards, to meet the demands of current truck buyers when it comes to configuration. The Tundra is available in regular and extended-cab versions. Unfortunately, regular-cab versions come only in longbed form, while extended-cab models come only as shortbeds. The latter does include two ""suicide"" doors for easier rear-seat access (which, by the way, is what Toyota calls its four-door Tundra layout: Access Cab), but the space back there is tiny in comparison to trucks from Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge and GMC. Those domestic truck-makers also let the buyer build a pickup to meet specific style and creature comfort needs, ranging from bare-bones work trucks to luxury-lined haulers. Toyota gives you three trim levels and a comparatively sparse option list, though dealers will likely be happy to load you up with running boards and gold packages if given the chance.Inside, the Tundra feels a bit more compact than its American counterparts, lacking adequate seat-track travel and a seat height adjuster (in the volume-leading SR5 Access Cab) for optimal comfort when taller drivers are behind the wheel. Rear seat room is also tight, with legroom at a premium for anyone of average height. Tundra's cabin does offer a quiet ride that surpasses competing trucks, as well as many cars, and options like leather seating and a CD changer further contribute to the Tundra's relaxing internal environment for shorter folks. But interior plastics come straight from the Corolla parts bin, and many have a cheap feel and luster that no amount of cowhide can mask. We wish Toyota offered more variety in areas like configuration and option packages, and an increase in cab space would help the Tundra better compete with the extended cab models from GM, Ford and Dodge. Still, the fact that a V8-powered pickup can now be had with a Toyota nameplate on it means that there's a new sub-set of rules for America's truck buyer.",V6 cylinder ,98," 220 lb-ft @ 3,600 ",, 5-speed manual

The 2016 Toyota 4Runner is a rugged body-on-frame SUV with more off-road capability than almost any rival, but as a daily driver it's lacking a bit of refinement. Rowdy, off-road ready, truck-based SUVs were once the  hottest segment in the market. But shoppers soon discovered that bouncy rides  and poor fuel economy were also part of the deal. That ushered in the  crossover, an easy-riding, car-based light utility vehicle that looks a lot  like an SUV but lacks its truck-based ruggedness. There are only a few traditional  SUVs left these days, and the 2016 Toyota 4Runner stands proudly among them.  Boasting available three-row seating, a spacious cargo hold and Toyota's reputation for reliability, the  4Runner stays true to its roots as a hairy-chested SUV that's ready for almost  anything.

The 2016 Toyota 4Runner  is an unabashedly truck-based SUV with go-anywhere capability.
Even in base SR5 trim, the Edmunds  ""B"" rated 4Runner is primed for off-road action. Standard  equipment includes items like mud guards and skid plates, while  four-wheel-drive models add a dual-range transfer case, hill-start assist and  hill-descent control. Move up the trim ladder and you can add better audio and advanced  electronic aids for more precise off-roading. Toyota has even beefed up towing  capacity for all models but the Limited trim. If off-roading and towing aren't  big on your list of things to do, though, there are better family SUVs  available. The 4Runner has a difficult time smoothing out potholes in the city  with its busy ride, and its fuel economy is woeful compared to most V6-powered  crossovers. And its optional third row seating is best reserved for kids, so if  you want adult-sized space back there, you'll need to look elsewhere.
If you don't need a third row of seating, the Jeep Grand  Cherokee is one of our favorites, offering competitive off-road  performance, several engine options, more robust towing capacity, better fuel  economy and an upscale interior. The related Dodge Durango also has more towing capacity and a premium cabin, comes standard with a  third-row seat and also has earned an Edmunds ""B'  rating. If you can do without all the trail-busting hardware, the ""A""  rated Toyota  Highlander offers room for eight passengers, a carlike ride and superior  efficiency and acceleration.
But if nothing less than a rugged three-row midsize SUV will  do, the 2016 Toyota 4Runner is the only game in town. It may be among the last  of a dying breed, but it still has a lot to offer. The 2015 Toyota 4Runner employs a 4.0-liter V6 engine that  produces 270 horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque. The transmission is a  five-speed automatic. The SR5 and Limited models are available with either  rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive, while the Trail and TRD Pro are 4WD-only.
Four-wheel-drive SR5 models have a part-time 4WD system with  low-range gearing, while the Limited uses a full-time 4WD system with low-range  gearing and a locking center differential. The Trail and TRD Pro models come  standard with the part-time 4WD system and also include a locking rear  differential, crawl control (for use in low range) and selectable terrain modes.  Properly equipped, the 4Runner SR5 RWD or 4WD and the Limited RWD model are rated  to tow up to 5,000 pounds; the Trail and TRD Pro models tow up to 4,900 pounds  and the 4WD Limited model tows up to 4,700 pounds. 
In Edmunds testing, a 4WD 4Runner Trail went from zero to 60  mph in 7.8 seconds, which is about average among competing SUVs.
The EPA  estimates fuel economy at 19 mpg  combined (17 city/22 highway) for RWD models and 18 mpg  combined (17 city/21 highway) for all 4WD 4Runners. Those numbers are typical  for a traditional SUV, but well behind those of most V6-powered crossovers.  Standard safety features on the 2016 Toyota 4Runner include  antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front seat side airbags,  full-length side curtain airbags, front knee airbags and active front head  restraints. All 4WD models feature an off-road traction control system known as  A-Trac that helps keep you moving on slippery terrain by redirecting engine  torque to the wheel(s) that have traction.
A rearview camera is standard across the board, but front  and rear parking sensors are available only on the Limited trim level. The  Limited also comes with Safety Connect, which includes automatic collision  notification, a stolen-vehicle locator and emergency assistance.
In Edmunds brake testing, a four-wheel-drive 4Runner Trail  model took 132 feet to stop from 60 mph, which is a long distance by crossover  standards but not bad for an off-road-oriented SUV.
In government crash tests, the 4Runner earned four out of a  possible five stars overall, including four stars for total frontal-impact  safety and five stars for total side-impact safety. The Insurance Institute for  Highway Safety awarded the 4Runner its top rating of ""Good"" in the  moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and roof-strength crash tests, but  the small-overlap frontal-offset crash test resulted in a ""Marginal""  rating (second-lowest). The 4Runner's seat/head restraint design was rated ""Good""  for whiplash protection in rear-impact crashes.  The Toyota 4Runner is designed to provide real utility when  the pavement ends. It's at its best when you're plugging along on off-road  trails, and the numerous upgrades on the Trail and TRD Pro trims only add to  the fun. At the same time, the 4Runner is refined enough for the daily grind,  though lots of bumps make it into the cabin as the rugged suspension and big  tires jostle you around. The 4Runner's steering feels a little too light in  normal driving situations, but is ideal for off-roading, as it results in  reduced wrist-wrecking kickback on gnarly trails.

If you want the ability  to keep on driving when you run out of road, the 2016 4Runner is a great  choice.
The 4Runner's V6 engine is strong enough for most needs, but  there's no denying that you get more grunt from rivals like the V8-powered Grand  Cherokee and Durango. The 4Runner's five-speed automatic transmission provides  well-timed shifts, but we certainly wouldn't mind another gear to calm the  engine on the highway and eke out another mpg or two. The interior of the 2016 Toyota 4Runner features instrumentation  and controls that are well laid out and easy to understand. Most owners will be  satisfied with the quality of the 4Runner's cabin materials, which are oriented  more toward durability than aesthetics. If you demand something a bit more  plush, an alternative such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee will likely be a better  fit.
All 4Runners come with a touchscreen audio interface placed  high on the center stack. Depending on which trim level you've selected, the  touchscreen brings various degrees of functionality from Toyota's Entune suite of smartphone-enabled  services and apps. All trims except the base SR5 and Trail include a navigation  system. The SR5 and Trail models' audio systems enable integration of  navigation from your smartphone. 

Cargo capacity is  abundant in the 2016 4Runner, especially for a midsize SUV.
As for passenger accommodations, the 2016 4Runner's standard  five-person seating arrangement includes a reclining 40/20/40-split folding  second-row seat. The  optional third-row seat is bound to be a tempting option for carpoolers, but  you'll want to make sure your elementary schoolers will actually fit, as this  is one of the smallest, tightest third rows of any midsize SUV.
In reality, the real estate in the back of the 4Runner is  better suited for cargo. There's a healthy 47 cubic feet of cargo room behind  the second-row seats, a number that jumps to an even more impressive 89.7 cubic  feet with all the rear seats folded down. This is far more space than the Grand  Cherokee offers, and more than many large crossovers (such as the Ford Explorer  and Honda Pilot) as well. 
The SR5 comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, skid  plates, mud guards, a tow hitch, hill-start assist and hill-descent control  (4WD only), a rearview camera, foglights, heated exterior mirrors, rear privacy  glass, LED taillights, roof rails, a power liftgate window, a windshield wiper  de-icer, keyless entry, cruise control, air-conditioning with second-row vents,  cloth upholstery, a six-way power driver seat with power lumbar adjustment, a  leather-wrapped tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and 40/20/40-split folding  and reclining rear seats. Standard electronics features include Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, Scout GPS  Link cell phone navigation integration, and an eight-speaker audio system  with a 6.1-inch touchscreen interface, voice controls, a CD player, HD and  satellite radio, an auxiliary audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface. 

The 2016 4Runner's  dashboard continues the blocky, truck-inspired theme.
The SR5 Premium adds a sunroof, upgraded exterior mirrors, leatherette  (premium vinyl) upholstery, heated front seats, a power front passenger seat,  an auto-dimming rearview mirror and an upgraded version of Entune with smartphone  app integration and a navigation system.
Go with the 4WD-only Trail trim and you'll get all of the  base SR5's standard features plus unique 17-inch wheels, a hood scoop, silver  exterior trim accents, a locking rear differential, selectable terrain modes  and crawl control. The Trail Premium model adds the SR5 Premium's standard  features.
The 4Runner Trail models are exclusively eligible for the  optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS), which automatically  disconnects the SUV's stabilizer bars in low-speed off-road situations to  improve suspension articulation over deep ruts and boulders.
The TRD Pro comes with most of the Trail Premium's standard  equipment, adding or substituting matte-black 17-inch wheels with special  off-road tires, automatic headlights, a TRD-stamped aluminum front skid plate, Bilstein shocks, upgraded front springs, a  higher ride height, a unique black front grille and various TRD-themed  aesthetic upgrades.
The 4Runner Limited includes most of the Trail Premium's feature  content, but it lacks the mud guards, locking rear differential, terrain-mode  selector and crawl control. Its available full-time 4WD system instead employs  a locking center differential. Other Limited highlights include 20-inch alloy  wheels, adaptive roll-reducing dampers (X-REAS),  automatic headlights, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and  ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, ventilated  front seats and a 15-speaker JBL sound system and Toyota's Safety Connect  telematics.
Many of the higher-end standard amenities are available as  options on lower trim levels, but availability can vary depending on the region  of the United States in which you live. Stand-alone options include fixed  running boards, automatically deploying/retracting running boards, a sliding  rear cargo floor (two-row models only) and roof-rack crossbars.",V6 cylinder ,125," 278 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",, 5-speed shiftable automatic

Included with the Odyssey 2.1 upgrade is more power, a new five-speed transmission, standard rear disc brakes and side airbags, optional leather seating and DVD entertainment, two new exterior colors and minor interior storage refinements. The best minivan sold in America just got better for 2002. The second-generation Honda Odyssey is currently recognized as the minivan benchmark, having thieved the crown from Chrysler shortly after its debut in 1999. Honda reliability, coupled with a cavernous interior and useful features like a fold-flat third-row seat and second-row captain's chairs that can be slid together to serve as a bench are among the reasons the Odyssey has single-handedly revived interest in minivans. For 2002, Honda has made a number of changes to ensure that its minivan stays on top.Headlining the changes is an increase in horsepower. The 3.5-liter VTEC-equipped V6 now produces 240 horsepower and 242 pound-feet of torque, an increase from 210  and 229 lb-ft. Honda says the revised engine provides for quicker acceleration and no longer requires premium fuel. It is connected to a new five-speed automatic transmission (upgraded from a four-speed) that offers improved shift quality and efficiency.There are two trim levels: LX and EX. The base LX model includes such standard fare as a height-adjustable driver seat (with thicker bolstering this year), traction control, dual sliding doors, power windows (including power rear-vent windows), power locks, power mirrors, cruise control, a theft-deterrent system, front and rear air conditioning and antilock brakes. Step up to the EX and enjoy features like dual power sliding doors, a roof rack, keyless remote entry, an eight-way power driver seat, alloy wheels, a CD player and steering wheel-mounted radio controls.Sitting on a four-wheel independent suspension, a first in the minivan segment, the Odyssey rides comfortably and keeps the driver in touch with the road. Combined with the Odyssey's wide track, the suspension contributes a nimble and stable feel. Body roll around corners is minimal, particularly for a vehicle of this size, and the suspension has been retuned this year to reduce harshness over bumps.A key Odyssey feature continues to be its hideaway, or ""magic,"" third-row seat. With a minimum of effort and the use of just one set of hands, the rear seat can be folded out of sight and sit flush with the floor in a matter of seconds. The second-row seats are convertible and can be used as separate captain's chairs or as a bench. In terms of features, a navigation system is optional on the EX and employs a single DVD disc for nationwide mapping. For 2002, Honda has added leather seating to the list, as well as a DVD entertainment system with a 7-inch LCD monitor that flips down from the ceiling.A minivan would not be complete without safety features, and the Odyssey comes with its share. All seven seats have headrests and three-point seatbelts, and each Odyssey comes with ABS (four-wheel disc brakes are standard this year), traction control and an Electronic Brake Distribution system (EBD). Also new for this year are dual stage front airbags and driver- and front passenger-side airbags. In government and insurance institute crash testing, the 2001 Odyssey couldn't have scored better, getting five stars all around. This is one van that does a great job of protecting occupants.With its excellent crash-test scores, innovative features and cavernous interior, the Honda Odyssey might just be the ultimate family vehicle.",V6 cylinder ,195," 242 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",, 5-speed automatic

Unique sheet metal now differentiates the Trailblazer from its GM cousins, the GMC Envoy and Oldsmobile Bravada, while a restyled interior makes better use of the additional passenger room inside. Finally, an SUV from GM that can compete with the big boys. Add in some higher-quality interior pieces and a more tightly controlled suspension, and it might even beat some of them. After years of lagging behind the competition with old-tech engines, bouncy suspensions and cramped interiors, Chevrolet has finally revamped its midsize Trailblazer and turned it into a true class contender. Replacing the old 4.3-liter V6 is an all-new inline six-cylinder that boasts 270 horsepower and 275 foot-pounds of torque. That's more power than most of its competitors' V8s and allows the Trailblazer to tow a respectable 6,400 pound (on properly equipped two-wheel-drive models). A four-speed automatic does the shifting and a dash-controlled transfer case delivers both high- and low-range gearing for off-road excursions.The revised suspension consists of dual A-arms with coilover shocks in front and a solid axle and a five-link system in the rear. The new pieces are mounted to an all-new hydroformed frame that is substantially stronger than before, providing a stiffer overall structure and much improved ride quality. Rack-and-pinion steering has replaced the old reciprocating ball setup, but the overall feel is still a little on the slow side for our tastes. The longer and wider chassis allows for noticeably more interior room, with five adults able to fit comfortably. There's no third-row option as of yet, but GM promises that a stretched model is on the way that will provide ample room for a couple extra passengers. The dash has been redesigned with easy-to-read gauges and simple climate and radio controls. Material quality has been improved over previous models', but the Trailblazer still lags behind some of its competitors when it comes to overall refinement. There are three trim levels offered: LS, LT and LTZ. Base LS models come well equipped with dual front and side airbags, dual zone climate control, four-wheel antilock disc brakes and a six-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system. LT models add a power driver seat with premium cloth, 16x7-inch polished sport wheels, keyless entry, the OnStar communications system, foglamps and an electrochromic rearview mirror with compass. Standard equipment on the top-of-the-line LTZ models includes power adjustable leather seating with memory, 17x7 aluminum sport wheels, automatic climate control with separate rear seat controls, a premium audio system with rear seat controls, rain-sensing wipers and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with satellite stereo and climate controls.So whether you're looking for a stripped-down workhorse or a fully loaded luxury cruiser, the all-new Trailblazer can be configured to suit your needs.

Audi,audi tt,2000,audi tt 2000,,"['Comically small rear seat in the coupe', 'Limited cargo capacity hurts practicality']",,"When  the first Audi TT made its U.S. debut in 2000, it received rave reviews for its  groundbreaking Bauhaus-inspired design and peppy performance. In some ways, it  was a more distinguished alternative to the cute and mechanically related VW  Beetle revival. More than two decades later, the TT has gotten away from its  styling roots but maintains its fun-to-drive nature. 
The  current third-generation 2023 Audi TT is showing its age, though, as it was  last redesigned in 2016. With the public's waning interest in small and sporty  coupes, it seems likely that 2023 will mark the end of the TT line, at least in  its internal combustion form. That means if you've ever wanted one of these fun  little coupes or convertibles, you should act sooner rather than later.
As  much as we like the Audi TT, there are some alternatives worth considering. The  BMW 2 Series is coming off a fresh redesign for 2022 and it's our current class  favorite with stronger performance and a more affordable price. There's also  the BMW-built Toyota GR Supra that is more athletic but less practical. Even  within Audi's own stable, the A3 and S3 are wildly entertaining and more  up-to-date when it comes to technology.  Most drivers will find the Audi TT completely satisfying in its base form. Because there aren't any typical trim levels to choose from, the only real decision to make is whether to add the S Line Competition package.

It offered  the practicality of a sedan but the fun of a sporty hatchback. Subsequent  generations tried, and mostly failed, to recapture the fun and engagement of  the early GLIs. But Volkswagen has decided to refocus its efforts for the 2019  Jetta GLI, and the results look to be very positive. 
On the performance side of things,  Volkswagen lifted the engine and transmission options straight from the  much-liked GTI. The GLI has 228 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, up 14   and 51 lb-ft from last year's model, as well as the option of a six-speed  manual, a rarity in the small-sedan ranks. The GLI also benefits from the new  Jetta's upgraded interior, with the options of leather seats, an 8-inch  touchscreen and a digital instrument panel.
A few other automakers still make  affordable sport sedans. The Honda Civic Si is lighter and a bit less expensive  than the Jetta, while the Subaru WRX, though dated in terms of design, still  packs a punch. Among them, the revitalized 2019 GLI rightfully takes its place  as a top model to consider.  Each vehicle typically comes in multiple  versions that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our first drive of  the Volkswagen Jetta GLI (turbo 2.0L  inline-4 | 6-speed manual | FWD). This Jetta is about as close to a GTI as you can get without actually buying one. The engine has a satisfying amount of power at almost any rpm, and either transmission makes easy work of city traffic or a great back road. The brakes and suspension can keep up as well, making the GLI quite the well-rounded sedan. VW has struck a very good balance with the GLI's ride quality. You've got compliance and control, seemingly without sacrificing one or the other. The engine note is subdued but livens up when you select Sport mode. The front seats are comfortable but lack the lateral support we expect from a sport sedan. Instantly recognizable as a VW, even with the optional digital dashboard, the GLI's cabin feels immediately comfortable. The shape and design of the steering wheel and driving position are both befitting a sport sedan. Visibility is good and typical for a sedan. On the downside, the excess of hard plastic interior panels cheapens the experience. The Jetta GLI has one of the larger trunks in the small-sedan class. The rear seats are split 60/40 and can be folded to enhance utility. Interior storage for your personal items is ample and includes storage under the armrest and in front of the shifter. The hard plastic door bins are generously sized. Standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto work well enough with the 6.5-inch touchscreen, but the optional 8-inch unit is the one to have. The digital instrument panel is also pretty sharp and adds welcome sophistication to the interior. The optional BeatsAudio system sounds great. Unless  you have your heart set on the base-level S, we'd recommend the top-of-the-line Autobahn trim for its wealth of  extra features for only a few thousand dollars more. You get a panoramic  sunroof, a digital instrument panel, and heated and ventilated leather seating  as well as an 8-inch touchscreen. 
The S comes standard with 18-inch wheels, a limited-slip differential, LED lighting,  a leather-wrapped steering wheel, heated front seats, dual-zone climate  control, and adjustable interior ambient lighting. Also standard are keyless  entry with push-button start, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and automatic  wipers. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard, as is a 6.5-inch  touchscreen and a six-speaker audio system. 
Stepping up to the 35th Anniversary adds dark gray 18-inch wheels with a unique design  and blacked-out exterior trim. There's various 35th Anniversary badging inside  and out as well. But the biggest difference is the DCC adaptive suspension,  which is unique to the 35th Anniversary trim.
The top-of-the-line Autobahn trim adds a panoramic sunroof, ventilated leather seats  with a power-adjustable driver's seat, remote start (when equipped with the DSG  automatic transmission), an eight-speaker BeatsAudio system, an 8-inch  touchscreen, satellite radio, and a digital instrument panel.
All Jetta GLIs come standard with a  rearview camera, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking,  blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and an automatic  post-collision braking system.

Additionally, the 2500 series 3/4-ton van is discontinued. The 2007 Chevrolet Express (and its twin, the GMC Savana) are pretty much the only game in town if you're looking for a traditional full-size van that doesn't look and drive as if it were designed two decades ago. Having been around for more than four decades, Chevrolet's full-size van lived through the '70s, '80s and half of the '90s via sheet metal changes and updates to the running gear. Still, it rode on the same basic platform that it had had since the swinging '60s until a complete frame-up redesign took place in 1996. To celebrate the rebirth, the van's name was changed from ""Sportvan"" to ""Express."" A new exterior look, new engines, extended body styles and improved ergonomics soon made the Chevrolet Express hard to overlook when compared with Ford's dated Econoline. A number of important under-the-skin changes took place for 2003, including a wider selection of V8 engines, the first-time availability of all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements -- all of which went a long way toward making the Express safer and more capable than ever before.The 2007 Chevrolet Express still outpaces the aged Econoline and certainly warrants consideration for those who need the immense passenger capacity (up to 15 people can ride in an Express 3500) and cargo volume only a large van can provide. Naturally, these attributes are most often needed by small businesses and fleet operators. Private individuals seeking a more economical or passenger-friendly alternative might want to consider the Dodge Sprinter. The standard engine on Express 1500 models is a 5.3-liter V8 with 295 horsepower and 335 pound-feet of torque. A 6.0-liter V8 rated at 300  and 360 lb-ft of torque is standard on 3500s. All 1500 models use a four-speed automatic sending power to the rear wheels, while 3500s get a heavy-duty version of that transmission. An all-wheel-drive configuration is also available for the 1500. The maximum trailer-towing capacity on 1500 models is 6300 pounds, while the heavy-duty 3500 can pull up to 9800 pounds when properly equipped. All models have four-wheel antilock disc brakes standard. The Express 1500 features a front passenger-sensing system that will deactivate the front airbag if it senses a small adult or child sitting up front, while 3500 models use a manual airbag deactivation switch for the front passenger. A stability control system is standard on the 3500 but not available on the 1500. In frontal-impact crash tests conducted by the NHTSA, the Chevrolet Express scored five stars (the highest possible).  A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2007 Chevrolet Express a leg up on Ford's Econoline when it comes to ride and handling. Although Chevy's van is still far from nimble, it's a better choice for day-to-day driving. And with three strong V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers come easily, even when you're hauling a heavy load of passengers and cargo. The Chevy's interior is built for pure functionality, and while it may not be pretty, it gets the job done. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but the footwells remain as cramped as ever. Express buyers can opt for 60/40-split driver-side doors for easier passenger access to the rear seats. The standard configuration seats 12, with 8- or 15-passenger arrangements also available, depending on which model you choose. The standard-wheelbase (135-inch) Chevrolet Express full-size van comes in half-ton (1500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations. The extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available only on the 3500. There are two trim levels: LS and LT. LS models are geared toward fleet service so standard equipment is limited to air-conditioning, an AM/FM stereo and a theft-deterrent system. The more livable LT models include auxiliary rear air-conditioning and heating, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and keyless entry. Optional equipment includes power driver and front-passenger seats, alloy wheels and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer.",V8 cylinder ,121," 335 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 4-speed automatic

Optional this year on the 1998 Jeep Wrangler are a tilting driver seat, automatic speed control, a combination CD/cassette stereo, a new Smart Key Immobilizer theft-deterrent system and two new colors. We were a little concerned last year when we heard that Jeep was giving its bad-boy mud-machine  an overhaul. Luckily, the Wrangler hasn't received the leather interior, cellular phone makeover that has recently emasculated so much of the sport-utility segment. No, the Wrangler remains the drive-me-hard-through-the-slop beast of yesterday, with a few appreciated improvements.Jeep Wranglers have long been the standard for those valiant explorers who truly wish to go where no one has gone before. The go-anywhere ability of the Wrangler has been improved by the Quadra-coil suspension which allows an additional seven inches of articulation over the old leaf spring set-up; thus resulting in increased approach and departure angles. Jeep boasts that the Quadra-coil suspension, as well as improved shocks and tires, also greatly improves the Wrangler's on-road manners.The Wrangler receives minor adjustments to the powertrain by combining the Dana 44 rear axle with a 3.73 axle ratio, replacing the 3.55 axle ratio with the 4.0-liter engine.  And Jeep claims that a revised torsion bar provides improved steering response.  Nobody, however, will mistake this vehicle for a smooth-running family sedan; the Wrangler is very much a truck. A five-speed manual transmission remains standard and a three-speed automatic is available for those who don't plan on doing any serious off-roading.For 1998, most people will not notice any changes to the Wrangler other than the new Chili Pepper Red and Deep Amethyst exterior colors.  Front bumper guards have been added and a new underhood lamp will aid in finding the wiper fluid reservoir in the dark.  A TLEV (Transitional Low Emission Vehicle) 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine is available for states adopting California emission regulations, so Jeep owners  can feel even closer to nature: they make less smog.Over the past two years, Jeep has done a great job improving the Wrangler. Gone are some of the nagging complaints we had about safety, wind noise and engine roar; what remains is a solid truck with hard-core capabilities and rugged good looks. This is obviously not the truck for everybody, but those willing to put up with a cloth interior and a little road noise will be rewarded with an amazingly fun vehicle.

Gmc,gmc yukon,1996,gmc yukon 1996,,,4.6,"A two-wheel-drive two-door Yukon becomes available. A new 5700 Vortec V8 gets long-life coolant and spark plugs, as well as a hefty bump in power and torque. Passenger car tires on less stout Yukons result in a softer, quieter ride. Rear heat ducts, illuminated entry, and height-adjustable seatbelts debut. Four-wheel-drive models get an optional electronic shift mechanism. Shoppers who savor the idea of sport-utility motoring but need extra space have no alternative but to turn to General Motors.  That's what GM's promotional folks claim, at any rate, though a relatively roomy Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee might fill the bill for some families.To capture this segment of the market, GMC launched the full-size four-door Yukon last year, joining its longer-lived two-door stablemate.  Chevrolet's Tahoe is a near-duplicate, also offered in both two- and four-door format, with two- or four-wheel drive.  Two-wheel drive is new to the two-door model; formerly, only four-wheel drive was available.  In the size race, both fit squarely between the Blazer/Jimmy compact and the big-bruiser Suburban wagons.  Squint your eyes, in fact, and the difference between a Yukon and Suburban begins to evaporate, despite the latter's extra 20 inches of steel.Interiors have been borrowed from the full-size Sierra pickup, including a driver airbag and right-side A-pillar assist handle--a sensible addition, as climbing into full-size models can be a chore.  Rear passengers get new heat ducts this year, and illuminated entry is now standard.  Seat belts are height adjustable to fit many differently sized people, and 4WD models can be equipped with an electronic shift mechanism that is activated by pressing a switch on the dashboard.  An electrochromic rearview mirror keeps bright lights out of drivers' eyes.  Speaking of lights, the ones on the Yukon are on all the time, thanks to GM's obsession with daytime running lights.The insanely popular Yukon four-door, and the sporty two-door, receive a new gasoline engine this year.  Called the Vortec 5700, it pumps out 50 more horsepower and 25 foot-pounds more torque than last year's 5.7-liter V8.  Two-door Yukons can also be ordered with a 6.5-liter turbodiesel engine.  Manual shift, too, is offered only on two-door models.  Four-door owners enjoy the smoothness of GM's four-speed automatic transmission, with electronic controls.  Yukon four-doors can have either panel-style rear doors or a tailgate with lift-glass.  Two-door 4WD models get passenger car tires that reduce noise and improve the ride.Naturally, though, you can still expect truck-style ride and handling, but reasonable comfort on the road.  General Motors expects to have this market niche to itself for another year or more, until Ford and Dodge release SUV's a tick larger than the Explorer and Grand Cherokee.  Not a bad deal, this Yukon, and think of the juicier 5700 engine as your reward for waiting so long to get your hands on one.",V8 cylinder ,150," 325 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Its low-slung, sloping roofline  paved the way for an entire genre of coupe-like SUVs, and though some  competitors do the swoopy sport ute thing slightly better, they owe their  existence to the X6.  Based  on the midsize X5 SUV, the X6 essentially takes that design and carves out a  portion of the roof to form a fastback rear end. The design grants it a sleeker  profile but also cuts into rear  headroom  and cargo space. It also hurts visibility since the rear windows are smaller.  Still, there are buyers who love the look enough to sacrifice those things in  the name of fashion. Though  the BMW had a healthy head start on its coupe-like SUV competition, its rivals  are now catching up to the original and in some cases surpassing it.  Raked-roofline SUVs such as the Audi Q8, Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe and Porsche  Cayenne Coupe give the X6 a run for its money, though the BMW is able to stay  in the fight thanks to a high-quality interior, comfortable ride and sporty  driving dynamics.  Of the X6's two trim  levels, we think the base xDrive40i is the one to get. Its six-cylinder engine produces plenty of power and it  comes with a solid list of standard features out of the box.

New looks up front come from a revised bumper and grille, and the interior gets dressed in new fabric. With its doors open and beckoning, Honda's stylish and competent family hauler resembles a tall station wagon more than a minivan. Why? Because instead of the expected sliding side door--a staple of minivan design from the start--you find that all four side doors swing open, like those in a sedan. They contain roll-down windows, too. Naturally, Honda hopes that this unique attribute will help steal sales away from the competition, but a single special feature isn't enough to ensure success in the ferocious minivan market.Fortunately for Honda, Odysseys possess other virtues. For starters, you get plenty of room for four or five, with a spacious center section that's exceptionally easy to enter. Either bucket seats or a three-seat bench can go there. Not enough? Well, a handy two-passenger bench seat pops out of the cargo floor to expand passenger capacity to seven. That back bench folds flat very easily when cargo is the priority, and an inside-mounted, compact spare tire takes up very little space.The driver occupies a comfortable position behind a low cowl and a severely sloped windshield. Small front quarter windows do little for visibility to the front corners, but the large sideview mirrors are very good. An unusual slanted dashboard holds a distinctive speedometer. In addition to a large glovebox and ample console storage box, the Odyssey offers a smaller supplementary glovebox. On the safety front, airbags are installed for both the driver and front passenger. So is all-disc antilock braking.Power comes from a 150 horsepower, 2.3-liter 16-valve VTEC four-cylinder engine borrowed from the Accord. Adequately brisk performance is accompanied, unfortunately, by an excess of buzziness. If noise is a drawback, you'll want to wait for the V6 Accord-based minivan due in 1999. Engines in both the LX and EX editions drive an electronically-controlled four-speed automatic transmission, complete with a Grade Logic Control System and controlled by a column-mounted gearshift lever.

The 3.1-liter V6 engine is standard this year, and has been improved to offer more horsepower while meeting low emission vehicle (LEV) standards. A spoiler and a gold package are available. Chevy's non-descript Malibu is one of the best cars General Motors makes. Roomy, quick and loaded with features for a low price, it's tough to go wrong with the too-often overlooked Malibu. Chevrolet is producing good cars and trucks. Witness the excellent values to be found in the Blazer, Camaro, Cavalier and Impala. The Malibu is more of a good thing. In fact, this is one of the best family cars produced by any domestic automaker today.Consumer clinics determined much of the Malibu's design. What consumers have demanded is a tight, solid, roomy, fun-to-drive midsized sedan. Guess what? Chevrolet delivers, and delivers big with this car. The Malibu is all of these things and more, wrapped in unobtrusive yet attractive sheetmetal and sold at a price that undercuts similarly equipped imports and domestics.Two models are available. For 2000, the base Malibu features a substantially improved 3.1-liter V6 engine, now making 170 horsepower and 190 foot-pounds of torque.  What's more, this venerable motor meets low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards.  Gears are shifted automatically, and standard equipment includes four-wheel antilock brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, battery rundown protection, theft deterrent system, tachometer, air-conditioning, rear-seat heat ducts, tilt steering wheel and remote trunk release. Step up to LS trim and you leave the showroom in a fully loaded car. The LS includes aluminum wheels, fog lights, remote keyless entry, power driver's seat, power windows and door locks, cruise control, uplevel stereo, and a trunk cargo net.This Chevy goes, slows and turns corners well enough to be entertaining, particularly with this year's boost in power. Interior design elements include a handy, left-handed cupholder, backlighting for major controls and switches throughout the interior, and heating and air conditioning ducts located on the A-pillar to help direct air flow to rear-seat passengers. Also notable is the retro-style dash-mounted ignition switch, because the driver doesn't have to crane his neck around to find the key slot.Malibu has safety concerns covered, too. Dual airbags, four-wheel antilock brakes and child-safe rear door locks are standard. According to Chevrolet, side-impact door beams exceed federal standards for protection, though federal side-impact crash tests indicate that occupants may actually be rather vulnerable in this car. Maintaining the Malibu has been made easy with platinum-tipped spark plugs that last up to 100,000 miles, engine coolant designed to last five years or 150,000 miles, and transmission fluid that never has to be changed or checked.Our list of gripes is short. The fake wood in the LS, revised for 2000, is unnecessary. We also want to find an integrated child safety seat on the options list in the future. And why can buyers get traction control on the Cavalier but not the Malibu? The list of improvements for 2000 doesn't address our concerns. Assist handles have been added to the headliner, door lockout protection is standard, and seat fabric has been revised.  Mudguards front and rear are now body-color, and base wheel covers are redesigned.Still, the Malibu impresses us.

Honda,honda passport,1996,honda passport 1996,,,4.1,"New wheels, dual airbags, available ABS and a stronger V6 engine are the changes for the 1996. Except for freshly styled alloy wheels, not much was new with Honda's Passport as the 1995 model year began.  Midseason, Honda issued a notable upgrade, adding airbags for the driver and front passenger.  Also new were roof-mounted speakers that expanded available cargo space in the revised interior, plus an improved stereo system.  The new dashboard, did away with the old angular look, replacing it with an organically swept affair complete with more legible gauges and improved ergonomics.For 1996, Honda finishes the Passport off with available four-wheel disc antilock brakes, more power for V6 models, and standard shift-on-the-fly operation for 4WD models that can be engaged at speeds up to 62 mph.  Wheel track is wider which improves ride quality and four-wheel capabilities.  Better yet, the SOHC V6 engine's output now matches that of last year's DOHC motor: 190 horsepower.Passports are spacious for five inside, and V6 models have a swing-out spare tire that creates even greater elbow room.  The rear seat folds flat, resulting in a long cargo floor, but the clamshell tailgate design makes it difficult to access the back of the cargo area easily.  They are however, better for watching softball games.  Fortunately, the rear glass will open independently making it easier to load small items.Road noise might be a drawback, though the 3.2-liter V6 engine is quiet-running and strong with either five-speed manual shift or the available four-speed automatic transmission.  A 2.6-liter four-cylinder engine, delivering 70 fewer horses, powers the two-wheel-drive DX edition, which comes only with manual shift.  Automatic transmissions have Power and Winter modes, the latter starting off in third gear to reduce wheel-spin on slippery pavements.  Towing capacity is 4,500 pounds with the V6 engine, but only a ton with the four-cylinder.Anyone seeking a capable blend of comfortable highway ride and tempting off-road talents could do well to look for a Honda dealer.

Former class-leading V-6 not as strong as much of the competition these days.  Not as good a value as it used to be.'],3.6,"Blazer gets a front-end restyle and an interior redesign. New standard equipment includes a theft-deterrent system, automatic headlight control, four-wheel disc brakes and dual airbags incorporating second-generation technology to reduce the bags' inflation force.  New radios, colors and a column-mounted automatic shift selector round out the major changes. Back in 1982, Chevrolet rolled out the S-10 Blazer, the first modern compact sport-utility vehicle.  Sixteen years later, the Blazer remains a bestseller in one of the hottest automotive markets.  It's not hard to understand the Blazer's appeal.Powered by a strong 4.3-liter, 190-horsepower, V6 engine and offering several suspension choices, the Blazer can be tailored to specific needs, with either two- or four-wheel drive, two doors or four.  The four-door is the most popular by far: the model of choice with families on the go.  There are accommodations for as many as six passengers in the bigger Blazer, but four would most likely be more comfortable.  There's lots of cargo space too, with the spare tire mounted underneath the cargo floor on four-door models.  Chevy claims that, with the rear seat folded, a washing machine box will fit into the cargo bay.  We tried it with a test vehicle, and they aren't fibbing.  Sadly, the Blazer's interior is marred by acres of chintzy plastic and little rear foot room in front of a somewhat low and mushy seat.  Adult rear seat riders will complain loudly.Off-road is not where the Blazer shines, though a ZR2 super-duty suspension package is optional.  Available only on two-door 4WD models, the ZR2 Blazer has a special chassis with four-inch wider track, huge 31-inch tires, specially-tuned Bilstein 46mm shocks, drivetrain refinements, an underbody shield package and LS trim.  Regular Blazers are capable enough for two-track dirt, but serious off-road adventures would be better handled by something with more wheel travel.  However, most families don't spend much, if any, time off-road in their sport-utes, so this is not a large shortcoming.  As a road going hauler, the Blazer is quite capable.   For 1998, Chevrolet has updated the Blazer nicely.  The exterior gets new front styling that provides a more familial look to help tie the Blazer to other truck models in the Chevrolet stable.  The interior is new, featuring a redesigned dashboard and dual airbags.  The automatic shifter is located on the steering column rather than the center console, lending the interior a more airy and open appearance.  A theft-deterrent system, automatic headlight control, and four-wheel disc brakes are all standard.  Heated exterior mirrors and an electrochromic rearview mirror are standard on LT models and optional on the LS.  Two new colors debut: Light Pewter Metallic and Dark Copper Metallic.When the current Blazer debuted for the 1995 model year, it won the North American Truck of the Year award.  Smart styling, a powerful drivetrain and reasonable pricing made it a hit with the public.  Lately, however, the competition has caught up with the Blazer.  A new V6 engine went into the more refined Ford Explorer for 1997, and it is more powerful than the Blazer's motor.  Jeep updated the Cherokee last year, offering nearly as much interior space as the Blazer and four-wheel drive for around $20,000.

Three new paint colors round out the changes.Well-controlled overall, with good steering feedback, Rangers handle easily, corner capably, maneuver neatly and stay reasonably stable on curves. Occupants aren't likely to complain about the ride, either, though it can grow bouncy around town. This is not surprising, as mileage isn't the greatest with the powerful four-liter engine and five-speed automatic.The four-door SuperCab makes it easy to access the storage compartment from either side of the truck, a big assist when loading cargo and gear. The standard rear doors on SuperCab models hinge off the corner pillars of the cab and swing out 90 degrees from the vehicle. There are no B-pillars to obstruct loading.

Ford,ford mustang,1996,ford mustang 1996,,,4.1,"Ford plugs a 4.6-liter modular V8 into its pony car. Base cars also get engine improvements, and all 1996 Ford Mustangs get minor styling revisions. The GTS model, a midyear 1995 V8 base Mustang, has been dropped. Since Ford introduced a redesigned Mustang for the 1994 model year, sales of the popular pony coupe have surpassed the expectations of even the most optimistic bean counters in Dearborn.  The Mustang is selling almost as many copies as the Chevy Camaro and Pontiac Firebird combined, despite weaker engine choices and less sleek styling; dealers are clamoring for more of them.For 1996, Mustangs are infused with a host of powertrain improvements.  All motors get 100,000 mile  platinum-tipped spark plugs.  Base models get a reworked ""Essex"" 3.8-liter V6, based on the engine from the now defunct Thunderbird Super Coupe, but good for just 150 measly horsepower.  Mustang GT has a new 4.6-liter V8 under the hood.  Smoother and cleaner than the 5.0-liter pushrod engine it replaces, the much-anticipated 4.6-liter engine disappoints with horsepower and torque ratings that are essentially unchanged from the old engine.  The big power is reserved for the limited-production Cobra model.  A DOHC 4.6-liter mod motor packs a 305 horsepower punch in the Cobra, but it comes at a steep price premium.  The Cobra performs slightly better than the new Ram Air Firebirds released by General Motors this year.  However, with production of just 10,000 copies and a cost of $26,000 per car, the Cobra has limited appeal.  Folks who've been waiting for a real engine in the GTsince 1994 will likely head for Chevy dealerships in exasperation.Suspension revisions and steering improvements make the Mustang more fun to drive this year.  New wheels, taillights and colors liven up the exterior a bit.  The GTS model has been dropped, ensuring that the 1995 GTS, which was produced for a scant six months, will become one of the more collectible Mustangs of the nineties.All things considered equal, the Mustang offers good performance value for the dollar, as long as you keep your hands out of the options toy box.

The standard audio system has also been upgraded, while Access Cab models get a new rear-seat design and standard power windows and door locks. With rising gas prices gluing full-size trucks to dealer lots, folks who still need a pickup's utility should find that the midsize and more fuel-efficient 2009 Toyota Tacoma is an ideal alternative. People need trucks. Of the millions that roam America's roads, though, there are a great many driven by folks who don't come close to utilizing their pickups' full potential -- particularly the full-size examples. Until recently, lower gas prices have made such an overkill automotive purchase acceptable -- but today, full-sizers are clogging dealer lots worse than a lifetime of bacon triple cheeseburgers clog your arteries. Luckily for those who truly need a pickup, there are midsize alternatives to the jumbo full-sizers. Among them, the 2009 Toyota Tacoma is your best bet.Adding to the Tacoma's practicality is a wide variety of combinations based on different cab styles, bed lengths, engines and trim levels. From the bare-bones work truck to the high-zoot Double Cab SR-5 with a long bed, there should be a Tacoma that fits anyone's needs. Plus, with an impressive interior and high level of available equipment, including an increase in standard safety content for 2009, the Tacoma can be as friendly to a plumber and his crew as it is to a family of four.In the past, we basically dismissed the base four-cylinder engine, since the V6 was clearly better suited to the Tacoma's mass. With rising gas prices, however, the four-cylinder, with its output of 159 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque, certainly seems more attractive. If your Tacoma is going to be used as a work truck and not involved with any heavy towing, the four-cylinder's fuel savings is an important aspect to consider. It offers more power than all but one competitor's four-cylinder, while offering better fuel economy. In total, the Tacoma is also a better-rounded candidate than those competitors, which include the Chevy Colorado, Dodge Dakota and Nissan Frontier. The 2009 Toyota Tacoma Regular and Access Cabs come standard with a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 159  and 180 lb-ft of torque. Rear-wheel-drive models come with the choice of a five-speed manual or a four-speed auto. Four-wheel-drive models only get the manual. Fuel economy for a rear-drive four-cylinder Tacoma with the auto is 19 mpg city/25 mpg highway and 21 mpg combined. Getting a manual improves that number slightly, while getting 4WD hurts it more.The 4.0-liter V6 standard on the Double Cab and optional on the Access Cab produces 236  and 266 lb-ft of torque. The Double Cab is 4x4 only. With the exception of the PreRunner Double Cabs, a five-speed manual transmission is standard, with a five-speed automatic optional. A Tacoma Double Cab V6 we tested sprinted to 60 mph in just 7.8 seconds, making it one of the quickest midsize trucks available. Fuel economy for the 4x4 Double Cab with the auto is 16 mpg city/20 mpg highway and 18 mpg combined. Opting for the manual or the 4x2 Access Cab helps mileage. When properly equipped, the Tacoma can tow 6,500 pounds. All Tacoma pickups for 2009 come with stability and traction control, antilock brakes (disc front, drum rear) with brake assist, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and front active headrests. Hill-start assist control (HAC) and downhill assist control (DAC) are provided for 4WD models equipped with an automatic transmission.In government crash testing, the Tacoma received a top five-star rating for its protection of occupants in frontal and side-impact crashes. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Tacoma its top rating of ""Good"" in its frontal-offset crash test. The Tacoma is also the only compact/midsize truck to receive the highest rating of ""Good"" in the IIHS side-impact test. In this time of rising gas prices, the four-cylinder engine we once dismissed as simply ""adequate"" doesn't look that bad anymore. Its acceleration won't blow you away, and don't count on towing anything, but for a work truck, it makes sense. However, the V6 is a strong all-around performer, with plenty of pull down low and a willingness (albeit a somewhat noisy one) to spin into the upper rev ranges. Plus, towing heavy loads poses no problem for this powertrain. In terms of handling, the 2009 Toyota Tacoma feels like a true truck from behind the wheel. It excels in off-road situations and is reasonably comfortable on the street. But depending on how it's equipped and whether it's carrying a load or not, the Tacoma's ride can seem skittish and bouncy at times. The Tacoma is restrained in design, yet still offers high levels of quality and practicality. Fully loaded models include metallic trim and are quite classy -- especially compared to industrial rivals like the Dodge Dakota. The gauges and controls are straightforward and easy to use. The Double Cab's rear seat is comfortable for adults and storage space is plentiful. (There's a new rear-seat storage system standard on the Access Cab.) However, some drivers might take issue with the positioning of the driver seat, feeling that it's mounted too low to the floor. For hauling cargo, a non-rusting and dent-resistant composite cargo bed comes standard on all models, while an optional bed-mounted 115-volt/400-watt electrical outlet is ideal for campers and outdoor sports enthusiasts. Tacoma Regular Cabs are meant primarily for workhorse duty and are sparsely equipped. Standard features include 15-inch steel wheels, a limited-slip differential, a composite bedliner, a bed utility-rail system, a tilt/telescoping steering wheel, a front bench seat and a four-speaker stereo with a CD player and an auxiliary audio jack. The Tacoma Access Cab gains air-conditioning, power locks and windows, a rear bench with underseat storage and six speakers. The Tacoma Double Cab adds keyless entry, upgraded cloth upholstery and driver lumbar adjustment.Most options are grouped into packages available throughout the cab lineup. The SR-5 Package bundles exterior enhancements with interior upgrades (fancier seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, cruise control). The TRD Off-Road Package includes 16-inch alloy wheels, fender flares, exterior chrome trim, a heavy-duty suspension, a locking rear differential, skid plates and sport seats. The TRD Sport Package includes 17-inch alloy wheels, a hood scoop, a sport suspension and sport seats. Separate options available include alloy wheels, cruise control, a towing package, rear park assist and an upgraded stereo with six-CD changer, satellite radio and Bluetooth (Double Cab only).All body styles are available in both two- and four-wheel drive. A PreRunner version available in all body styles gets the rugged look and suspension of a 4WD truck without the added weight, fuel appetite and traction of actual 4WD. The rear-drive-only X-Runner version is more performance-oriented, with a body kit, 18-inch alloy wheels, a low ride height, a hood scoop, foglamps and an upgraded stereo.",Inline 4 cylinder ,235," 180 lb-ft @ 3,800 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Toyota,toyota highlander,2023,toyota highlander 2023,"['Comfortable, quiet ride', 'Easy to see out of', 'Above-average fuel efficiency for a three-row SUV']","['Third row is kids-only', 'Not much cargo space behind the third row']",,"Toyota's  Highlander is one of the most well-known three-row midsize SUVs around. It's a  great choice for growing families and offers versatility similar to a minivan  but is more enjoyable to drive and easier to maneuver in most cases. The 2023  Highlander is based on the most recent generation Highlander that debuted in  2020 and receives some updates this year.  
Most  notably, Toyota has dropped the Highlander's previous V6 engine in favor of a  new turbocharged four-cylinder. It's down on horsepower compared to its  predecessor but makes more torque. The new engine feels more substantial than  you'd expect from a smaller four-cylinder engine in a vehicle this large. Power  delivery is smooth, and the engine and eight-speed automatic transmission work  in harmony to respond quickly to throttle inputs and get the SUV up to speed  easily. The new four-cylinder engine also gets slightly higher EPA-estimated  fuel economy than the old V6, helping to make this one of more fuel-efficient  three-rows on the market. But it's also a lot noisier than the old V6 when you  accelerate aggressively, and that can get annoying.
Inside,  the digital information display on the Limited and Platinum trim levels grows  from 7 inches to 12.3 inches, matching the size of the central touchscreen on  those trims. The 12.3-inch touchscreen is now optional on the midtier XLE and  XSE, allowing more price-conscious shoppers to upgrade the infotainment system  if they want. Those models also get the hands-free liftgate that used to come  standard on more expensive levels. Finally, wireless connectivity for Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto comes standard across the lineup.
While  these 2023 changes are certainly welcome, they don't address the Highlander's  rear space drawbacks and do little to impact the bottom line. We're more likely  to recommend the Highlander Hybrid, which is covered in a separate review on  Edmunds. The Hybrid doesn't cost much more than the standard Highlander and  gets significantly better fuel economy. For non-hybrid models, the 2023 Toyota  Highlander falls short of the mark set by the dominant Kia Telluride and  related Hyundai Palisade. The praiseworthy Honda Pilot is all-new for 2023 and  has a chance to reclaim its class-leading position. 
Overall,  the 2023 Highlander is a likable enough SUV. But its easy-driving nature and  high fuel economy may not be enough to surpass our favorites in the class.  That's why we suggest a thorough comparison test drive to see which SUV fits  your life the best.  The  midrange XLE trim gets our recommendation for its balance of price versus  features. For a reasonable premium over the supporting trims, you get several  niceties such as heated front seats, faux leather upholstery, second-row  sunshades and a wireless charging pad. It also comes with second-row captain's  chairs, but you can swap them out for a three-seat bench as a no-cost option.",Inline 4 cylinder ,160," 310 lb-ft @ 1,700 ",rear wheel drive ,

Side curtain airbags that offer head protection for front and rear passengers are introduced this year, and steering wheel controls for the audio and cruise systems are available on GLS/GLX trim models. Optional 17-inch wheels and a sport suspension can be had on GLX models and GLS models with the 1.8T or VR6 engine. The Wolfsburg Edition returns as a limited-edition model in early 2001 -- standard features include sport suspension, bolstered sport seats and 16-inch BBS wheels. All models get redesigned cupholders and a trunk entrapment release button. A wagon arrives in the spring of 2001. While the Jetta isn't quite the bargain it used to be, its sleek looks, spirited demeanor and quality interior materials make it one of our top recommendations to small sedan and wagon buyers. The Jetta, Volkswagen's sedan version of the Golf, has always been one of our favorites. Like many cars conceived in Germany, the Jetta possesses an uncanny ability to keep the driver in touch with every undulation and irregularity on the road without sacrificing comfort. For 2001, the fourth-generation of VW's best-selling Jetta sedans will see only minor equipment changes. The wagons, however, offer a new way to enjoy the Jetta.Jetta sedans are available in GL, GLS and GLX trim, while wagons are either GLS or GLX. GL and GLS models come with a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that produces 115 horsepower and makes 122 foot-pounds of torque at 2,600 for decent off-the-line acceleration. Standard features on the GL sedan include side airbags, a cassette stereo and ABS. GLS models offer more standard goodies like cruise control, power windows and mirrors, and a center armrest.A turbocharged direct injection (TDI) diesel engine is optional on the GL and GLS sedans. When mated to a manual transmission, the TDI will achieve approximately 49 mpg. A gas-powered, turbocharged 1.8-liter engine, sourced from Audi and good for 150 horsepower, is also available for GLS sedans and wagons and imbues them with a spirited ride. We feel the 1.8T is the powerplant to get if you're shopping for either the sedan or the wagon. Wagon buyers will have to wait until the summer of 2001, though.Optional on all GLS models and standard on the top-of-the-line GLX is a buttery-smooth 174-horsepower VR6 engine. GLX also provides nifty equipment like rain-sensor wipers, automatic climate control, leather seats, self-dimming rearview mirrors and wood trim. For 2001, all Jettas get a side curtain protection system that provides head airbags for front and rear passengers. GLS and GLX models can now be had with multi-function steering wheel controls and 17-inch wheels. A new-for-2001 sport suspension is available for GLX models and GLS models with the 1.8T or VR6 engine.Volkswagen will send 20,000 Wolfsburg Edition Jetta sedans to the United States in 2001. Besides their sporty suspension, seats and wheels, these models come with the 1.8T powerplant; a leather-wrapped steering wheel, shift knob and brake handle; and Wolfsburg Edition exterior badging.The Jetta's exterior is sleek and curvaceous; built with high-tech bonding agents and laser-welding techniques, the Jetta is structurally rigid, which makes for crisp handling and a solid feel. The Jetta has always been a driver's car, providing an enjoyable experience despite a simple MacPherson-strut front suspension and a torsion-beam rear axle. Accented by stabilizer bars and four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, Jetta's underpinnings provide decent handling and braking qualities.Due to its popularity and subsequent price increases, the Jetta is not quite the bargain it used to be. Still, Volkswagen's bread-and-butter sedan offers upscale interior components, and the top-level GLX model feels downright luxurious. And the wagon, with its additional cargo space, arrives just in time for the sport wagon movement. If cost is not your primary concern in selecting a compact sedan or wagon, you should give the Jetta a look.",Inline 4 cylinder ,285," 122 lb-ft @ 2,600 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Much of that comes down to its well-rounded nature.  There's enough style, performance and comfort here to make you feel like you're  getting your money's worth. And unlike some Audi sedans, it's available in both  front- and all-wheel-drive configurations.  
Audi  didn't add anything new to the A3 for 2020. Rather, it's relying on a thorough  reshuffling of the sedan's trims and features to keep buyers interested in what  will likely be the A3's final year. The company has downsized the trim options  from four to two for the 2020 A3. The A3's features, though, are essentially  the same. Audi also discontinued the slow-selling A3 convertible.
We  do suggest checking out the rival Mercedes-Benz A-Class; it surpasses the A3 in  a lot of ways, especially in technology features. BMW has also come out with an  all-new 2 Series Gran Coupe. Even the sporty Volkswagen Jetta GLI, which shares  some corporate DNA with the A3, could be worth a look if you want to save some  money. But overall we think the A3 should satisfy the needs of most shoppers in  the market for a small luxury sedan.
What's  it like to live with the A3?
Edmunds'  editorial team acquired and lived with an Audi A3 2.0T Quattro sedan for a full  year, logging 20,000 miles. It quickly became obvious that although the A3 is  Audi's entry-level sedan, it's a proper luxury car. We love the strong engine,  quiet cabin and front seat comfort, but we found the trunk space a bit limiting  and out-of-warranty maintenance fairly expensive. Note that we tested a 2015  A3, but most of our observations still apply to the 2019 A3. To read about our  entire experience, check out our long-term A3 test. We  recommend the A3 S line. It delivers the more powerful engine and all-wheel  drive, which we think are worth the added cost.

Among them is a standard in-dash six-disc CD changer, OnStar telematics system as an option, an improved stability control system and updated navigation system software. While the A8 and A8 L aren't top performers in the super-luxury sedan segment, their well-appointed cabins and all-wheel drive make them feasible alternatives to offerings from BMW, Lexus and Mercedes. The A8, introduced to the U.S. in 1996 as a 1997 model, is in its final stages before a new generation makes its way. Sporting senior A4 styling, sumptuous interior appointments, and the revolutionary Audi Space Frame (ASF), the A8 is lighter and more responsive than many other super-luxury competitors.  Employing lightweight aluminum-alloy construction, ASF is designed to provide superior structural rigidity, improved handling and responsiveness, better fuel efficiency and easier recycling. Gas-filled shocks, beefed-up frame reinforcement and lightweight suspension components further contribute to ride comfort and handling in the A8.There are two models available: the A8 and the A8 L. The A8 L offers an extended wheelbase, with more head-, shoulder- and legroom for rear occupants. Both models feature a 310-horsepower 4.2-liter twin-cam aluminum-alloy V8 engine. This engine sports 40 valves (five per cylinder) and makes peak torque of 302 pound-feet between 3,000 and 4,000 rpm. An adaptive five-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic shift controls is standard equipment.Audi's vaunted quattro all-wheel-drive system is also standard. Additionally, Electronic Differential Locking (EDL) provides low-speed traction control operating through the standard antilock braking system. Electronic Braking-Pressure Distribution (EBD) is included with the ABS system, and ensures that maximum braking capacity can be utilized whenever needed, regardless of road or load conditions.  Safety is not ignored in the A8. Dual front airbags are supplemented by side airbags tucked into the front seats. Rear passengers also get side airbags, mounted to the seat rather than the door panel. Audi's Sideguard head airbag system consists of inflatable curtain airbags installed in the headliner along each side of the car, which cover the windows in the event of an accident and remain inflated for 5 seconds to protect the head in case the vehicle rolls over. Audi also offers a standard stability control system.Inside, drivers will find an interior slathered in real wood and Valcona leather upholstery. Front seats are power adjustable in 14 different ways, and a memory feature accommodates four different settings for the driver seat, exterior mirrors, driver headrest height and steering wheel position. The front passenger seat also gets a memory feature and a multifunctional steering wheel with audio, telephone and Tiptronic controls. The steering wheel tilts out of the way when the key is removed from the ignition. The automatic dual-zone temperature controls employ two sunlight sensors to help maintain accuracy.  The A8 is a solid luxury sedan, and it can be a fine choice for consumers living in cold or rainy climates.

Reliable but bland, the Corolla is a conservative pick in the economy sedan class. Toyota's venerable Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the best-selling nameplate in the history of automobiles. Now, while that's neat and all, we're sure that what's really important to you and your wallet is whether this modern Corolla still has what it takes to stomp out its competitors. In short, it doesn't.Dating to 1998, the current Corolla faces stiff competition from the Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Mazda Protege and Nissan Sentra, all of which have been substantially redesigned or newly introduced since this particular Toyota was fresh out of the blocks. And they are all more satisfying cars, both in terms of comparable feature content as well as driving experience. To help fend them off until the next redesign, the Corolla comes equipped with a zippy, smooth-revving 1.8-liter four-cylinder aluminum engine that cranks out 125 horsepower, thanks to a variable valve timing and lift system that Toyota calls VVT-i. VVT-i employs continuously variable intake valve timing to provide greater engine performance, better fuel economy and reduced pollution over a wide rev range. When equipped with a manual transmission, this car pulls strongly. Automatic gearboxes are available, too, including a technologically advanced (not!) three-speed unit on base models.Three trim levels are available on the 2002 Corolla: the base CE, better-equipped LE and sporty S. The S model includes ""sporty"" trim such as body-colored rocker panels and door handles, foglights, fake leather-wrapped steering wheel and a tachometer with outside temperature display. Step up to the LE to get power mirrors, a 60/40 split folding rear bench and a tilting steering wheel. Our biggest gripe with the Corolla is minimal legroom for both the driver and passengers and the horribly uncomfortable seats. Center stack ergonomics also aren't up to standards in the class, and the soft suspension keels over in turns, making the tires howl in pain. But the ride is smooth, the cabin is quiet at speed, side airbags are an unusual option for the class, and the parts used in the car's construction exude quality; a good thing, since many of the interior trim pieces are shared throughout the Toyota lineup.Few competitors can match Toyota's run-forever reputation and high levels of build quality.

Otherwise, the van is unchanged save for the AM/FM sound system now being optional instead of standard. Powerful engines and some unique features make the Express (and its twin, the GMC Savana) pretty much the only game in town if you're looking for a full-size van that doesn't look and drive like it was designed two decades ago. Introduced in 1965, Chevrolet's full-size cargo van has since undergone only one complete redesign. Constant improvements throughout the '70s, '80s and '90s kept it somewhat up to date, but not until a full redesign in 1995 did the Express become a legitimately modern vehicle. A new exterior look, new engines, extended-length body styles and improved ergonomics made the Express hard to overlook when compared with the aging Econoline from Ford. The latest version incorporates features like four-wheel antilock disc brakes and powerful V8 engines that make the Express safer and more capable than ever before. The standard engine on two-wheel-drive 1500 models is a 4.3-liter V6 rated at 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque.

Also available on 2500 and 3500 series vans for 2006 is a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8 with 250  and 460 lb-ft of torque. All 1500s use a four-speed automatic transmission, while 2500 and 3500 series vans get a heavy-duty automatic. Trailer capacities range from 5,900 to a stout 10,000 pounds, depending on the model. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes are standard on all models. Light-duty models (GVWR less than 8,600 pounds) feature a front-passenger sensing system that will deactivate the front airbag if it senses a small adult or child sitting up front. Heavy-duty models use a manual airbag deactivation switch for the front passenger. A reinforced frame, larger stabilizer bars, rack and pinion steering (half-ton models only) and an upgraded brake system give the Express a leg up on the Ford Econoline when it comes to ride and handling. Although the Express is still far from nimble, its modern running gear makes day-to-day driving a much more enjoyable experience. The brakes require less effort than those of the Econoline, and the powerful engines really make a difference when it comes to merging and passing. The interior is built for functionality and not much else. The controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver. Available 60/40-split driver-side access doors make it easier for the whole crew to get in and out of the van. The standard wheelbase (135-inch) Express comes in half-ton (1500), three-quarter-ton (2500) and one-ton (3500) configurations, while the extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) requires either three-quarter-ton or one-ton running gear. The one and only trim level comes standard with air conditioning and a theft-deterrent system. The option choices include typical items like a rear air conditioner and heater, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel, keyless entry and a CD stereo. Also included on the options list is a host of job-specific cargo configurations, as well as swing-out access doors.",V6 cylinder ,285," 260 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 4-speed automatic

Fewer automakers offer them because  consumers are increasingly gravitating to SUVs and highly capable midsize  sedans. Toyota, however, is one brand that's still carrying the torch. In fact,  it's doubled down. Redesigned just last year, the Toyota Avalon simultaneously  exemplifies and upends the conventions of the class. 
Like  past Avalons (and most large sedans), this latest model has a V6 engine that  delivers smooth acceleration. It also has a roomy interior. Though only  slightly larger than the Toyota Camry, the Avalon has acres of legroom for all  occupants and a higher percentage of premium materials. The Avalon lends itself  well to long road trips thanks to the supportive outboard seats and minimal  wind noise. 
Toyota  also plays against type by bringing performance into the picture. The Avalon,  with nimble handling and quick steering, is surprisingly up to the challenge of  zipping along a curvy road. There's even a new TRD model this year with a  sport-tuned suspension. If you want an uncompromising blend of performance and  comfort, consider the top Touring trim. It's equipped with adaptive dampers  that soften the ride or sharpen handling at the press of a button — a  rare feature for this type of vehicle.
Downsides?  Well, there's not a huge amount of headroom, which is odd for this class of  vehicle, and Android Auto smartphone integration is conspicuously missing from  the features list. But overall, we think highly of the 2020 Avalon. It's a  definite step up in terms of quality and comfort compared to the Camry, and  it's the most well-rounded pick compared to rivals such as the Chrysler 300 and  the Kia Cadenza.  The  base XLE is equipped generously, and  we think many buyers would be happy with its accommodations. But if you can  swing the higher monthly payment, we say go for the loaded-up Touring. You're  buying an Avalon because it's supposed to be a little nicer than  run-of-the-mill sedans such as the Camry and Honda Accord. How does the Avalon drive? With a potent 301-horsepower V6 mated to a smooth-shifting transmission, the Avalon has good power to get up and go. It is also pleasant to use in most scenarios, from long road trips and afternoon cruises to day-to-day commutes and short errands around town. Braking is consistent and never grabby, which lends to its comfort in daily use. 

   The Avalon is surprising in its athleticism — its shockingly enjoyable handling and drivability. While not a sport sedan, this cruiser can handle twisty roads with relative ease for a vehicle of its size. Think about a mobile defensive end or tackle in football as opposed to an athletic linebacker. How comfortable is the Avalon? Comfort is a strength for the Avalon and is probably the primary reason you'd consider such a large sedan. All seating positions give you ample cushioning and support for long drives or short cruises. The leather upholstery is very soft and gives the sensation that the Avalon is more upscale than its price suggests. 

   The ride is cushioned and makes you feel shielded from harsh roads. The cabin is also really cozy due to the climate control's quick heating and cooling. While there is no rattling or shaking inside the cabin, road noise is somewhat present at all times. How’s the interior? The Avalon's cabin is a decent place to be. It is roomy and user-friendly. There are even redundant key functions located on the steering wheel. Legroom is abundant, the driving position is superb due to its multitude and depth of adjustments, and visibility is great up front and modest to the sides and over the shoulder. 

   As far as controls go, there are two minor issues: The radio tuning knob can be a reach for some, and a couple of functions, such as turning on the camera view, are tucked away. While legroom is a strength, headroom can feel a little compromised for taller people — especially in the rear due to the sloping roofline. Lastly, the low-resolution rearview camera and display could use an upgrade. How’s the tech? Toyota's Entune system and its 9-inch touchscreen are surprisingly good. Apple CarPlay support makes things so much better, but Android Auto is still absent. The display is bright and responds well to inputs, but Toyota tends to lock out more functions while you're driving than other carmakers. 

   There's one USB port for data and four 2.1-amp power-only USBs — two up front and two in back. The front console also houses a wireless charging pad. The car's built-in voice controls are hit-or-miss — it's better at understanding radio commands than navigation commands. We had much more success using Siri via Apple CarPlay. How’s the storage? While cargo capacity is average on paper, the Avalon works out to be more convenient compared to some others due to the wide trunk opening, broad floor and convenient loading height. You might be disappointed if you're the type who folds the rear seats to expand the space because there's a sizable step up to the folded seats.

   Inside, there are numerous small cubbies, plenty of cupholders, and a center console that's sizable and surprisingly deep. The door pockets are average, but there are enough other options that it's not a concern. The Avalon really shines when it comes to fitting child safety seats. The car seat anchors are easy to access, and the huge rear bench has space enough for just about any type of seat. How’s the fuel economy? The Avalon is rated at 25 combined mpg (22 city/31 highway), which is excellent for this class of car. It's not outstanding like the hybrid variant, but it's still really good. During our mixed-driving 115-mile evaluation route, we were able to observe 26 mpg, which slightly beat the combined EPA score. Is the Avalon a good value? The Avalon offers a good deal of quality and refinement. It feels close enough to the Lexus ES in this regard that someone looking for a large sedan might want to consider the Avalon instead because it costs thousands less. Beyond the great deal, you also get high gas mileage, a good roadside assistance program, and free scheduled maintenance for the first two years. The Avalon is a low-key performer. The exterior, aside from the huge brace-face grille, is nondescript, while the interior delivers a composed, civil, and sophisticated style. None of this is bad, but it sets you up to be surprised by its hidden athleticism. In the context of a big family sedan, it's fun to drive due to its surprising handling capabilities and strong V6 engine.",V6 cylinder ,200," 267 lb-ft @ 4,700 ",rear wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

Buy this car.  Audi's A4 is sleek, sophisticated, speedy and has won praise from the worldwide automotive media.  Small and safe, the A4 scored best in its class in the 35-mph offset crash tests performed in Europe upon its debut, and has performed brilliantly in stateside crash testing.  For U.S. buyers, this translates into a competent and crashworthy alternative to the BMW 3-Series, Acura TL-Series and Volvo S70, among others.For 1999, four versions are available: the 1.8T, 1.8T Avant wagon, 2.8, and the 2.8 Avant wagon.  A 2.8-liter V6 engine, putting 190 horsepower through the front wheels, powers the 2.8 models.  The less expensive 1.8T sedan, which features a turbocharged inline four-cylinder engine, is good for 150 horsepower.  New to the lineup is the 1.8T Avant, which complements the 2.8 Avant sport wagon that was introduced last year.  The new wagon is powered by a 1.8-liter, turbocharged, four-cylinder engine with five-valve technology, and is available with your choice of two transmissions: an automatic transmission with Tiptronic or a five-speed manual transmission.  The sedans can be ordered with front- or all-wheel drive and a five-speed manual transmission or an automatic.  Both Avants are equipped with Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive system. Audi's 1.8T sedan features alloy wheels, a unique Sport package, new under hood insulation and a base price starting in the low 20s just like last year.  Standard equipment on the more expensive 2.8 models includes the larger engine, wood trim and fog lights.  The 2.8's eight-way power driver's seat with lumbar support is exceptionally comfortable and a theft alarm keeps thieves from making off with the radio or anything else left in an unattended car.Audi buyers can personalize their cars by choosing from three different interiors, at no extra cost: the Advance, Ambiente and Ambition.  Avants come equipped with a heavy duty cargo net, retractable rear luggage cover, rear window wiper, 120-watt sound system with subwoofer and a roof-mounted, three-way antenna.  Audi now offers aluminum interior trim, manual driver seat adjustment, black roof rails and window trim, cloth or leatherette upholstery and alloy wheels with all-season tires standard on the Avant models as well.  New on both A4 Avants for 1999 is a standard rear child seat tether anchor.  The A4 features a multi-link front suspension that virtually eliminates torque steer, according to Audi.  We've tried a front driver, and these claims have been substantiated.  Dual front airbags, side-impact airbags mounted in the front seats and antilock brakes come standard.  Purchase an A4 and enjoy free maintenance for three years and 50,000 miles.  All 1999 A4s receive a modified cup holder in the center console, a larger right outside mirror, a First Aid kit and two new paint colors: Volcano Black and Jaspis Green.A short options list reveals that almost everything you need comes standard on the A4.  With prices starting near $24,000, consumers can get a status car that is comfortable and costs less than it does to send your kid to college.  We think that Audi has a winner with the A4: the affordable 1.8T, all-new 1.8T Avant, well-equipped 2.8, and sturdy 2.8 Avant will do nothing but enhance Audi's image with near luxury buyers.",Inline 4 cylinder ,200," 155 lb-ft @ 1,750 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Its claim to fame is its amazing gas mileage,  efficiency-first styling and space-age interior. And while the interior and  styling have changed over the years, the Prius' retains its fuel-sipping  tendencies, which are even better in the Prius Prime. 
With  the regular Prius, you can only fill up its gas tank. But what if you could  separately recharge its battery pack for even better efficiency? The Prius  Prime answers that question. It has a bigger battery and can drive in full  all-electric mode for 25 miles or so. For many people, that's more than enough  for around-town driving. Once the battery is depleted, the Prius' hybrid  powertrain takes over and delivers excellent fuel efficiency.
We  also like that Toyota has addressed a couple of issues on the 2020 Prius Prime.  It now has a rear bench seat with a fifth seat and comes standard with Apple  CarPlay and Amazon Alexa. The latter is an appealing substitute to Toyota's  native Entune infotainment system. 
There  are still a couple of downsides, including tepid acceleration and a small cargo  area. But on the whole, the Prius Prime is worth checking out if you're  shopping for an affordable and efficient plug-in hybrid.

Lexus,lexus rx-350h,2023,lexus rx-350h 2023,,"['New infotainment system could be more intuitive to use', 'Touch-sensing steering wheel controls are a source of irritation', 'Styling could put off some potential buyers']",,"As  the most popular Lexus model in America, the previous-generation RX midsize  crossover SUV apparently satisfied the luxury cravings of many people despite  a handful of sometimes glaring flaws. Now, a redesigned fifth-generation 2023  Lexus RX attempts to sustain and build upon that success, so it is comfortingly  similar to yet substantially different from the old RX. 
Styling  is a subjective matter, so as is often the case with Lexus models, if you like  the way it looks, then chances are you'll like most everything else about the  new 2023 RX. That assessment extends to the RX 350h, which is one of two models  to replace the previous RX 450h. (The other is the RX 450h+, a new plug-in  hybrid model arriving midyear, according to Lexus.) 
The  RX 350h is a conventional — rather than a plug-in — hybrid.  Unlike the V6-based RX 450h from last year, the 2023 RX 350h employs a  four-cylinder engine, improving fuel economy while retaining the off-the-line  responsiveness supplied by the electric assist motors. Better yet, based on the  automaker's claims, acceleration remains on par with the old RX 450h. 
As  part of the redesign, the previous-generation RX 450h L with its cramped  third-row seat is gone, leaving two rows of seats for up to five people in the  new RX 350h. If you believe the rumor mill, a proper three-row Lexus crossover  SUV is coming soon, likely based on the upcoming Toyota Grand Highlander.  Hybrid power is a good bet, though the new, larger Lexus three-row crossover  will probably use the more powerful drivetrain offered in the new RX 500h F  Sport Performance model (reviewed separately).
As  for the 2023 RX 350h, next-generation infotainment, convenience and driver  assist technologies debut, including a cloud-based navigation and natural voice  recognition system and a hands-free traffic jam assistant for when you're  crawling along at low speeds in commuter traffic. With its comfortable front  and roomy rear seats, and more cargo space than before, the new RX should  appeal to the luxury SUV buyers that have made it successful in the past.
And  while the new RX 350 faces several rivals, the RX 350h is in a class of one.  The only hybrid-powered alternative in the luxury two-row SUV segment is the  BMW X5 xDrive45e, and it's a plug-in model. You might also cross-shop the RX  350h with the smaller Audi Q5 TFSI 55 e, Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring and  Volvo XC60 Recharge, three additional plug-in hybrid alternatives all in the  compact luxury SUV segment. Our  recommendation for the new 2023 Lexus RX 350h is the Premium+ AWD, which provides the best blend of luxury, efficiency,  performance, technology and value. Better yet, it doesn't cost more than the  standard RX 350 with all-wheel drive, so the hybrid powertrain doesn't command  a price premium.",Inline 4 cylinder ,125," 233 lb-ft @ 4,300 ",rear wheel drive , Continuously variable-speed automatic

For example, a properly equipped Ford  F-150 can tow up to 14,000 pounds. But what happens when you need to tow  heavier trailers? That's when you step up to the heavy-duty truck class, and  you can't do much better than the burly 2022 Ford F-450 Super Duty. 
In  fifth-wheel trailer configurations, the F-450 can tow up to 37,000 pounds  (about as heavy as a loaded school bus), thanks to a potent turbodiesel engine  that cranks out a jaw-dropping 1,050 lb-ft of torque. But in addition to having  the muscle of a serious work truck, the F-450 also has the smarts and  refinement to appeal to a wider audience. At the high end of the lineup, you  can get a positively luxurious truck with amenities we're used to seeing from  BMW or Mercedes-Benz.
For  2022, the higher-trimmed F-450 models gain the new Sync 4 infotainment system  along with a striking 12-inch touchscreen. Besides giving the cabin a modern, tech-forward  appearance, it includes over-the-air updates and an upgraded voice activation  system capable of recognizing natural speech. 
Even  without the new infotainment upgrade, the 2022 F-450 is a solid alternative to  the equally capable Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD and Ram 3500. The F-450 is a bit  more expensive than those rivals, but we're confident demanding truck buyers  will find the added cost worth it. We  recommend the XLT trim if you're seeking a work-focused heavy-duty truck. The inclusion of an upgraded  infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, along with the  Co-Pilot360 suite of safety features, give it a considerable edge over the base  XL model.

Honda,honda accord,2011,,"['Ample passenger space', 'excellent visibility', 'four-cylinder fuel economy', 'available coupe body style', 'excellent resale value.']","['Intrusive road noise', 'so-so interior quality', 'seats uncomfortable.']",4.2,"For 2011, the Honda Accord receives the first significant updates for its current-generation platform. Most notably, fuel economy is up thanks to revised aerodynamics plus tweaks to the engines and transmissions. The SE trim level has been added and there are new optional features as well, including an iPod/USB interface, a rearview camera, driver memory functions and shift paddles. The exterior has been given a mild refresh, while the interior's climate-control buttons have been rearranged for compatibility with the optional navigation system. The 2011 Honda Accord might still be a champ in terms of sales, but we think astute shoppers will find that several of its competitors are now more compelling. ""What midsize sedan should I buy?"" The answer to  this question has long been ""Honda Accord."" It's the instinctive  response, like being asked your birthday or your dog's name. The Accord has  been a top choice in the segment so consistently that recommending one has  always been easy. Times are changing, however. With impressive new competitors,  the 2011 Honda Accord now has more serious rivals to compete against.
The current-generation Accord (it debuted in 2008) is the  biggest yet, offering the most accommodating interior in its class. Yet this super-sizing  of the Accord also comes with a downside, because it no longer feels like the ""right-size""  choice in the family sedan class. While its steering remains responsive and  tactile, the Accord has a tendency to feel super-sized when driven around  corners. Its acceleration is also a bit underwhelming, with a five-speed  automatic transmission doing duty here when most competing models now offer  snappier six-speeds.
There is one bright spot for 2011, because the Accord's  engines choices are now more frugal. Thanks to aerodynamic tweaks, engine  friction reductions and revised transmission gearing, the four-cylinder Accord  now has an EPA rating of 23 city/34 highway, a rise of about 2 mpg that takes the  Accord to the top of the fuel economy chart for family sedans. The V6 is also a  bit more efficient this year, too.
Unfortunately, the Accord's interior hasn't changed much for  2011. Compared to newer competitors like the Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata and Kia  Optima, the Accord's cabin looks and feels a bit down-market. The plastics aren't  as nice and the look is rather drab -- especially if you opt for gray. Honda has  made some slight changes to the convoluted climate controls found on  navigation-equipped models this year, but the Accord's center stack continues  to be plagued by far too many buttons.
Nevertheless, it's important to note that the 2011 Honda  Accord remains a solid pick among family sedans. It's spacious, fuel-efficient and  reliable and should hold its value well. The Accord also comes in a sporty coupe  body style, something that few other automakers offer in their midsize models.  So we still recommend the Accord. But choices like the 2011 Ford Fusion, 2011 Kia Optima, 2011 Hyundai Sonata, 2011 Mazda 6 and even the 2011 Suzuki Kizashi now outpace  the Accord in many areas, so the answer to ""What midsize sedan should I  buy?"" is now more muddled than it used to be. The 2011 Honda Accord LX trims and SE are powered by a 2.4-liter inline-4 engine that produces 177 horsepower and 161 pound-feet of torque. The EX version of this engine produces 190  and 162 lb-ft of torque. Both versions come standard with a five-speed manual transmission, while a five-speed automatic is optional. In Edmunds performance testing, an automatic-equipped LX-P went from zero to 60 mph in 9.1 seconds, which is on the slow side for this class. With the automatic, EPA-estimated fuel economy for both LX and EX versions is 23 mpg city/34 mpg highway and 27 mpg combined. The manual lowers the city number by 1 mpg.
The Accord EX and EX-L can be equipped with a 3.5-liter V6 good for 271  and 254 lb-ft of torque (251 with the manual-equipped coupe). A five-speed automatic is standard on both body styles, with the coupe getting shift paddles. The coupe can also be equipped with a six-speed manual gearbox. In Edmunds performance testing, a V6 sedan went from zero to 60 mph in 7 seconds, whereas a manual-equipped coupe did it in 6.3. The sedan achieves an EPA-estimated 20/30/24, while the coupe gets 19/28/22 with the automatic and 17/26/21 with the manual. Every 2011 Honda Accord comes with antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front side airbags and side curtain airbags. In Edmunds brake testing, the various Accords we've tested over the years have stopped from 60 mph in about 130 feet -- on the long side for this class of car.
In the government's new, more strenuous crash testing for 2011, the Accord earned top five-star ratings all around for overall performance, front-impact protection and side-impact protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Accord a top score of ""Good"" for the car's performance in frontal-offset and side-impact collisions and a second-best rating of ""Acceptable"" in the roof-strength test.
 Though we admire the 2011 Honda Accord's nicely weighted and communicative steering, much of the rest of the driving experience is a minor letdown. In particular, the body rolls too much in corners (the coupe is better in this regard) and the ride quality isn't as comfortable as what you'll get from other top sedans. Another concern is the greater amount of road noise than expected in this segment.
The base four-cylinder engine is unremarkable, providing leisurely and rather raucous acceleration, but the upgraded 190- version is more refined and offers the same fuel economy. Past Honda V6s have been something to brag about, but the 2011 Accord V6 lacks bottom-end torque and feels noticeably less powerful than the comparable V6s of the competition. The Honda Accord no longer features the sort of class-leading materials and construction that used to make its cabin a benchmark. There are more hard plastics than in some competing vehicles, and fit and finish has gone down a bit from the car's predecessors. A rather uninspired design with an abundance of buttons doesn't do it any favors. The optional navigation system boosts the button tally further, but its voice commands, high-mounted screen and multipurpose knob are at least user-friendly.
The top-of-the-line leather seats are polarizing -- some of us love their bold contours and firm support, while others complain of numbness after long trips and overly aggressive lumbar support. No such complaints have been directed to the backseat, which we've found to be the largest among the midsize class -- leg and headroom are abundant even for 6-footers. The 14-cubic-foot trunk is numerically on the small side, but it has a large opening and is thoughtfully shaped, making it seem usefully larger than it actually is. The coupe's backseat and trunk are obviously much smaller, but among coupes, the Accord is actually one of the most accommodating. 
The base LX trim comes equipped with 16-inch steel wheels, keyless entry, full power accessories, air-conditioning, cruise control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable manual driver seat and a six-speaker sound system with CD player and an auxiliary audio jack. The LX-P trim adds 16-inch alloy wheels and an eight-way power driver seat. The SE adds leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power-adjustable driver lumbar and heated front seats. The EX adds or supplants LX-P equipment with 17-inch alloys, a more powerful four-cylinder engine, a sunroof, heated mirrors, power-adjustable driver lumbar, upgraded interior trim, a six-CD changer and a USB audio jack.
The EX-L adds automatic headlights, dual-zone automatic climate control, heated front seats, leather upholstery, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, Bluetooth, a seven-speaker upgraded sound system, satellite radio and the option of a navigation system with voice control and a rearview camera. A V6-equipped EX-L also gains driver seat memory settings and a four-way power passenger seat.
The coupe's LX-S trim is equipped similarly to the LX sedan, but gets 17-inch wheels and a six-disc CD changer. The EX coupe does not include the power-adjustable driver lumbar, but does get the EX-L sedan's upgraded stereo without satellite radio. Both lumbar and satellite radio are added to the EX-L.

Remember Audi a decade ago?  Of course not.  Nobody does.  Back then, Audi was changing numerical model names almost daily, and some half-assed reporting by 60 Minutes had almost killed the marque.  Claiming to drive an Audi negatively branded you, and the old 80, 90, 100 and 200 model designations registered nothing on the social acceptability meter at the country club. Audi?  Isn't that a fancy Volkswagen?Audis are still fancy Volkswagens, but who cares?  The A4 and A8 are simply superb examples of automotive engineering.  This A6 is more of the same, adding new corporate styling themes from recent show cars to the mix.Under the hood is a 2.8-liter V6 engine making 200 horsepower.  The five-speed automatic transmission features Tiptronic shifting controls.  This powertrain will get the A6 from rest to 60 mph in a somewhat leisurely 8.8 seconds.  Opt for the $1,600 quattro all-wheel drive system, and it will take an extra half-second to get to freeway merging velocity.  Not stellar, but the old A6 was no speed demon either.  Want to go fast?  Get the A4 2.8 or A8 4.2.While a manual transmission is definitely missing from the equipment roster, plenty of other standard goodies are included for the $34,000 tariff.  You've got your alloy wheels, heated windshield washer nozzles, headlight washers, puddle lamps on each door, dual-zone climate control system with air filter, heated exterior mirrors, retained accessory power, power front seats, real wood trim, trip computer, 140-watt sound system with 10 speakers and side airbags.  You've also got quite a suspension holding it all in place. A four-link front suspension lifted from the A4 virtually eliminates torque steer under hard acceleration.  The new A6 provides a smooth, well-damped ride, without filtering out vital information from the underpinnings.  Steering effort is light, maybe even a tad too much so, but communicates effectively what's happening with the front tires.The new styling is unmistakably Audi, with a swept greenhouse and muscular fenders.  However, this new A6 isn't a stunner like the A4.  The rounded sheetmetal and sharply creased trim detail don't blend well to our eye, and the taillights on the sedan appear to have been lifted from Chevrolet's lowly S-10 pickup.  From someangles, the car looks great.  From others, it appears somewhat dumpy and jumbled. Front overhang can appear especially out of balance.  Fortunately, the gracefully swept greenhouse on both the sedan and wagon lends a touch of class and elegance to an otherwise characterless profile. Despite nitpicks, we believe the new A6 will prove enticing in the hotly contested entry-level luxury class.  But there's plenty to choose from at this price point, and a heavy load of options can quickly boost the A6's MSRP higher than is reasonable.

Honda,honda accord,1996,honda accord 1996,,,4.7,"All 1996 Honda Accords get revised styling, featuring new taillights and bumper covers.  Wagons have a new roof rack, while sedans boast a new pass-through ski sack. The benchmark.  The best-selling car in America.  The highest resale value in its class.  It needs a V6.  These are all statements that have been made with regularity concerning the Accord.  It is undoubtedly the most popular car in this country, despite what Ford (who includes fleet sales to such entities as rental car and government agencies in its sales totals for the Taurus) has claimed every year since 1992.  The Accord won a loyal base of customers by offering sprightly performance, room for four, frugal fuel economy and a virtual guarantee that, if cared for properly, the Accord would not break.Those qualities have made it the benchmark.  It is consistently the best-selling car to regular retail customers like you.  What about resale?  The current issue of Edmund's Used Car Prices says that a 1991 Accord EX sedan is worth approximately 70 percent of its original value.  Sure, the Accord is pretty pricey new, but the overall cost of ownership, when repairs, maintenance, and resale value are put into the equation, make it a bargain.During the 1995 model year, the Accord sedan finally got a V6.  However, it doesn't perform as well as some versions four-cylinder Accord.  Why?  Added weight, different tires, and an automatic transmission collaborate to make the Accord V6 slower and less nimble than a five-speed Accord EX.  Additionally, critics find that the V6 powertrain is not ideally suited to the Accord, citing smooth but dull response from both the engine and transmission resulting in a bland character; decidedly out of tune with other Honda products.  Hmmm...For 1996, Honda has given the Accord some styling tweaks -- new taillights and bumper covers, along with revised grille treatments give the Accord a fresh look.  Wagons get a roof rack, while sedans offer a new pass-through ski sack.The Accord EX equipped with a VTEC engine is quick, frugal, and loaded with equipment.  As an added bonus, it's fun to drive.

The XLT can be equipped with a rear video entertainment system for the first time. Eddie Bauer models can be done up in Premier Group packaging, which includes monochromatic exterior paint, second-row captain's chairs, moonroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, foglights and illuminated running boards. One major flaw, namely twitchy steering, turns us off the Expedition. Twitchy steering is not something you want in a tall 5,000-pound vehicle. Which one do you think Goldilocks would pick? With the addition of the Escape in 2001, it seems Ford has enough different-sized SUVs to satisfy everyone. And for those people who want something bigger than an Explorer, but smaller than an Excursion, the Expedition should be just right. After allowing GM to dominate the full-size SUV arena for years, in 1997, Ford introduced the Expedition, which had its sights squarely aimed at the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon. Able to seat nine people with its optional third-row bench seat, the Expedition is also easier to park and maneuver than the larger Chevy Suburban (or Excursion, for that matter). The vehicle also has useful payload and towing capacity: up to 1,955 pounds and 8,100 pounds, respectively. The Expedition is available in XLT or Eddie Bauer trim with either two- or four-wheel drive. Power-adjustable pedals are standard on all trim levels and allow drivers of smaller stature to move the pedals toward their feet rather than moving the seat uncomfortably close to the steering wheel. Side airbags and a handy reverse sensing system are optional for increased safety. Interior coddling can be increased with the optional rear-seat entertainment system, newly available on XLT models for 2002. Eddie Bauer models can be equipped with second-row captain's chairs for an authentic conversion van feel. Another option that we think everyone should investigate is the lighted running boards. The Expedition towers above the ground, and entering and exiting this truck will take its toll on most passengers after a few days. On the road, the Expedition is reasonably well mannered. It's obviously not a car, but compared to the old Ford Bronco, the Expedition rides like a limousine. Still, this vehicle is based on the Ford F-Series, and as such, handles much the same way a loaded-down pickup might. Directional stability could be better, and emergency handling maneuvers reveal the effects of Expedition's 4,900-pound or higher curb weight.Though Ford boosted output for both the 4.6- and 5.4-liter V8 engines last year, they still are less powerful compared to the Vortec powerplants found in GM's full-size utes. The Expedition's standard 4.6-liter motor makes 232 horsepower and 291 pound-feet of torque. Step up to the bigger 5.4-liter mill, and you'll be rewarded with 260 horsepower and 350 lb-ft of torque. Fuel economy, as applied to this vehicle, is an oxymoron, as you might expect.Ford's Expedition represents a decent balance between comfort and function in a full-size SUV, and its ability to seat nine people makes it popular with large families and those who have to haul stuff around. Nevertheless, we can't overlook the surprisingly roomy Dodge Durango, the better-executed Toyota Sequoia and the well-packaged Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon when discussing monster SUVs.

Also, several important safety and convenience options such as side curtain airbags, power-adjustable pedals, a tire-pressure monitoring system and automatic windshield wipers debut this year. Still a charmer in terms of overall performance, looks and features, only a spotty reliability record prevents us from giving the JGC our whole-hearted endorsement. Those looking for a mid-size SUV that is equally apt at bouncing over rocks as it is plying local shopping mall parking lots should certainly check out Jeep's Grand Cherokee.Now in its fourth year for the current body style, the Grand Cherokee comes in five trim levels: Laredo, Sport, Special Edition, Limited and Overland. The Overland, Special Edition and Sport are recent additions to the line.This year, a number of upgrades and options increase the Grand Cherokee's appeal. Now available is a high-output version of the 4.7-liter V8 that sports 25 more horsepower and 35 more pound-feet of torque than the standard 4.7. New rain-sensing wipers automatically turn on when the wet stuff falls and a tire pressure monitor helps keep track of this often overlooked, but important, operating status. Adding safety are optional side-curtain airbags and power adjustable pedals. And keeping everyone cool is an improved air conditioner that has been modified for quicker cabin cool-down.The Grand's standard engine is a 4.0-liter inline six that produces 195 horsepower and 230 pound-feet of torque. Matched to a four-speed automatic gearbox, this aged powerplant provides adequate acceleration, but lacks refinement in terms of noise and vibration control. Next step up is the 4.7-liter V8, rated at 235 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. The high-output 4.7-liter V8, standard on the Overland and optional on the Limited, brews up an impres-sive 260 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of twisting force. Both V8s are coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission.The optional Quadra-Drive four-wheel-drive system keeps things moving even if only one tire has traction, and its reaction time is faster than you can say ""stuck."" The Laredo's standard transfer case is the full-time Selec-Trac, while the Limited gets the on-demand Quadra-Trac II. You'll find standard cloth upholstery inside the Laredo, and if you go with the no-frills approach, you'll pretty much be able to buy a plain-Jane version of the JGC that'll provide you with decent levels of comfort without breaking the bank.Next up the ladder is the new Special Edition, which adds power seats, a 10-disc CD changer sound system, keyless entry, a security system, fog lights, a Homelink transmitter, Quadra-Trac II (4WD models) and lighted visor mirrors. Spring for the Sport model and you'll get the SE's luxury features along with leather seating, trip computer, heated mirrors, and a mono-tone paint scheme. The Limited features 10-way power-adjustment for the seats, dual-zone climate control system, automatic headlights, a memory system for the seat, mirrors and radio presets and auto-dimming mirrors.The ultimate GC is the Overland, which has a standard equipment list that rivals a Range Rover's. Front and side-curtain airbags, an Infinity sound system with 10-disc changer, heated/power front seats, Quadra-Drive, side step rails, power sunroof, wood/ leather steering wheel and 17-inch alloys wearing 235/65R17 tires are all fitted to the top dog in the Grand Cherokee lineup.While going off-road may not be something you've considered doing with your just-purchased luxury vehicle, remember that this is a Jeep, the original 4x4, and it hasn't lost any of its go-anywhere war heritage. Its petite dimensions allow it to squeeze through tight corners, and its high 8.7-inch ground clearance makes rock-climbing a breeze. We can honestly say that it knocks the pants off any other midsize SUV out there in terms of off-road prowess. The price for all this off-road revelry comes in the form of a lack of refinement and a dubious reliability record. If you truly don't plan on going off-road, but do plan on taking some cross-country jaunts using major freeways, consider Ford's Explorer or Nissan's luxurious Pathfinder. The Jeep Grand Cherokee is certainly capable of surviving in the asphalt jungle, while trundling through true wilderness is a walk in the park.

Rack-and-pinion steering becomes standard for both two- and four-wheel-drives.  A performance-oriented R/T model has been added to the lineup that already includes the SLT and the decked-out SLT Plus. A serious SUV, down to its stout towing ability, generous cargo room, unyielding ride and abysmal fuel economy. The 2-year-old Durango is Dodge's fierce competitor in the sport-utility market. Eighty percent of its parts are shared with the Dakota, including the platform, but the Durango's frame is actually three times stiffer than the pickup's. Unfortunately, the rough ride doesn't let you forget its close relation to a truck platform. It's somewhat bouncy and you'll be aware of the stiffness, yet it's not miserable enough for it to lose its cushy-cruiser status.The Durango may be compact on the outside, but once inside, you'll be shocked by the roominess. With a 7,600-pound towing capacity, it's an SUV that can be stuffed to the gills with family and friends, and still have the ability to haul your watercraft or other form of weekend fun. However, you'll have to make a choice: eight people, or useable cargo space, because you can't have the best of both worlds when there's a full house. The good news is that a roof rack is standard.If you are taking advantage of the third row, you'll appreciate the ease of the fold-and-tumble second-row seating. Legroom is notable throughout, but larger folk may want to avoid the third row for anything other than short jaunts. Headroom shouldn't be an issue, thanks to the raised roof line. Overall, the interior is quite comfortable, and instrumentation is simple and within reach, but expect wind noise and squeaking.The 4x4s inherit the new 4.7-liter Magnum V-8, a sprightly engine, requiring less-frequent fill-ups than with the other Magnums. The 5.2-liter Magnum V8 is standard on both the Sport and the SLT two-wheel-drives but the best choice for towing is the 5.9-liter V8.   Off-road, Durango is a capable, if somewhat oversized, backroads runner, able to tackle a wide range of obstacles. The Durango also shines as a grocery-getter and soccer-team hauler. Emphasis for this vehicle is on utility.The new Sport trim level joins the existing SLT and SLT Plus this year, which consists of an appearance package featuring two-tone paint, optional factory-installed running boards, five-spoke aluminum wheels, and Sierra Bronze Pearl Coat and Aquamarine Metallic exterior colors. Also debuting for 2000 is the performance-oriented R/T, with a 5.9-liter V8, quicker rear axle ratio, 17"" wheels, sport-tuned exhaust, and stiffer suspension. The Toyota 4Runner, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Explorer are rivals, but none of them have bolted in a third row of seats yet, so the Durango has the advantage in terms of passenger capacity. Also, a fully equipped SLT Plus comes in under $35,000 (and remember, that's for a V8, four-wheel drive, and leather seats), making it a budget-conscious splurge.",V8 cylinder ,394," 295 lb-ft @ 3,200 ",, 4-speed automatic

Additionally, the StabiliTrak stability control system and a tire-pressure monitoring system are now standard across the board.  With room for up to 9 passengers, gutsy V8 engines and a long list of available options, it's no wonder the Chevrolet Tahoe is one of the best-selling full-size SUVs on the market. Chevrolet is no newcomer to the SUV game; it rolled out its version of a full-size sport-utility vehicle more than 30 years ago. Its current model, the Chevrolet Tahoe, debuted in 1994. Formerly known as the K-Blazer, the Tahoe was built to be a rough-and-ready, go-anywhere sort of ride. Back when it first emerged, Chevy described it as a ""rugged, multipurpose family vehicle that's at home on and off the road,"" and the manufacturer has always seen to it that the vehicle is sturdy enough to live up to this promise.The 2000 model year brought with it a complete redesign for the Chevrolet Tahoe. Its decade-old platform was replaced with a new frame that was stronger and more rigid than previous designs; the 'ute also got two new V8 engines that provided it with more horsepower than ever before. The Tahoe continues to give drivers more of what has made the vehicle a favorite with those seeking transportation that efficiently handles both on-road and off-road adventures. With a roomy and comfortable interior, it makes a great weekend-getaway machine. If you want a sport-utility that can handle passengers and cargo as well as it does a backcountry road, the 2006 Chevrolet Tahoe should be on your short list.  A 4.8-liter V8 is standard on the LS, and it offers 285 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque. Optional on the LS and standard on the LT and Z71 is the 5.3-liter V8 that ups the ante with 295  and 335 lb-ft of torque. The standard transmission is a four-speed automatic with a tow-haul mode for improved performance under heavy loads. Four-wheel-drive models feature the push-button Autotrac transfer case, which provides both 2WD and automatic 4WD modes for driving on the street. The Chevy Tahoe can tow up to 7,700 pounds when properly equipped. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes are standard, along with a stability control system. Front-seat side-impact airbags are optional on all Tahoes, but full-length side curtain airbags are not available. In NHTSA crash tests, the Chevrolet Tahoe scored four out of a possible five stars for its protection of front occupants in frontal impacts. Either of the Chevrolet Tahoe's Vortec V8 engines delivers ample power in most situations. Those who pull a trailer often would be wise to opt for the 5.3-liter engine, as it provides a substantial bump in torque despite only 10 additional horsepower compared to the 4.8-liter V8. The suspension delivers a stable, smooth ride, regardless of whether the Chevrolet Tahoe travels on or off pavement, while the steering is light enough to maneuver the big sport-ute easily in tight situations.  Inside, the Chevrolet Tahoe provides a simple layout with easy-to-read analog instrumentation, user-friendly controls and well-cushioned seats. The quality of the materials, however, could stand improvement, as many of the plastics look and feel cheap. Second-row bucket seats are available when you order leather upholstery, as is a DVD-based entertainment system. An available 50/50-split third-row seat allows the Tahoe to seat anywhere from seven to nine people. With no third row and the second-row seats folded, the Tahoe offers 104 cubic feet of cargo volume. The Chevrolet Tahoe is available in three trim levels. The base LS boasts standard features like tri-zone manual climate control, a CD player, keyless entry, a driver information center, cruise control and OnStar. The LS comes with two rows of seating and can accommodate up to six thanks to a front bench seat; an optional third-row bench brings capacity to nine. The off-road-oriented Z71 model offers a specially tuned suspension, front captain's chairs with heaters and 10-way power adjustment, leather upholstery and unique trim. Uplevel LT models get the third-row seat standard, while adding automatic climate control and XM Satellite Radio.

So strong that it has branched off into a  collection of fastback-style ""coupe"" SUVs to provide a stylish  — yet less practical — alternative to standard versions.  The BMW X6 is the originator of the trend, and more than a decade after it  debuted, the X6 is still a standout choice among competition from Audi, Porsche  and, of course, Mercedes. 
One  can never accuse the X6 of getting lost in a crowd. It has one of the most  rakish rooflines of all the coupe SUVs, and compared with the X5 on which it is  based, the X6's styling cues seem to shout rather than whisper. Fortunately,  BMW backs it up with two powerful engine options and a wide array of available  performance upgrades. Inside, the X6 is more conservative and emphasizes  high-end materials and numerous standard features such as Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto. Should you get an X6? Logic says you should get an X5 instead;  it's less expensive and more practical. But the whole point of the X6 is to  appeal to your emotions, and on that front it's certainly a success.

Hydrogen-fueled cars are the latest to join the market.  They have their own set of advantages, with the main one that the refueling  time is similar to that of a regular gasoline-powered car. But being so new,  there's a distinct lack of refueling infrastructure available.  Hyundai  is undeterred, however, and its 2019 Nexo is the latest hydrogen fuel cell  vehicle to come to market. As with the two other main hydrogen-fueled vehicles  on the market, the Honda Clarity and the Toyota Mirai, the Nexo is only  available in select regions in California. But it does present a couple of  advantages. The main one is its SUV-like body shape, which provides additional  cargo space. Hyundai also fits the Nexo with plenty of upscale features,  including a big 12.3-inch touchscreen and available ventilated front seats.Considering  the limitations of the nascent hydrogen market, we're more inclined to suggest  a battery electric vehicle for most people looking to reduce their carbon  footprint. But if you have your heart set on hydrogen, the 2019 Hyundai Nexo  appears to be a strong choice in a very small class. The Blue trim gets our recommendation  because it comes with an impressive list of features and is also estimated to  get 26 more miles of range than the Limited. The Limited trim's added creature  comforts don't quite justify its premium.  The Blue trim is estimated to return 380  miles of range with standard features that include 17-inch wheels, LED  headlights, automatic high beams, heated mirrors, adaptive cruise control,  keyless entry and ignition, a virtual instrument panel, automatic climate  control, power-adjustable and heated front seats, 60/40-split folding rear  seats, a household-style power outlet, a 12.3-inch touchscreen, Bluetooth,  Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a navigation system. Standard  advanced safety features include an automated remote self-parking system,  forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot  monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, lane keeping assist, and a drowsy  driver warning system.  The Limited trim has a range estimate of  354 miles and adds 19-inch wheels, front and rear parking sensors, a sunroof, a  hands-free liftgate, ventilated front seats, a heated steering wheel, a  surround-view parking camera system, an eight-speaker Krell audio system, and a  blind-spot camera system.

But outside of some minor equipment and  trim changes, it's basically the same small sport sedan we've known for years.  Thanks to 288 horsepower and other sport-oriented upgrades, the S3 offers more  performance than the standard A3, yet it's more comfortable (and affordable)  than the sharp-edged RS 3 model.  The  S3 shares more than a little with its corporate sibling, the Volkswagen Golf R,  but that's hardly a bad thing. The Golf R is one of the most entertaining cars  on the market, and that fun-to-drive nature carries over to the Audi. Think of  the S3 as a Golf R sedan with an even nicer interior, though we wish Audi would  offer the Volkswagen's manual transmission.Overall,  we think the S3 is worth a look if you want a nimble and relatively subtle  luxury sedan. But checking out the competition will be a good idea. The  Mercedes-Benz A-Class, in particular, offers a newer design, more advanced technology  features, and a new performance-oriented AMG A 35 trim level that's every bit a  match for the S3.

With its capable suspension, excellent powertrain and standard room for nine, the Suburban remains one of the best family-haulers available anywhere ... but bring gas money. Still a strong seller after all these years, the ""original"" full-size sport utility is a force to be reckoned with. Although it no longer holds the title of the biggest sport-ute of them all, the Suburban still offers seating for nine and plenty of cargo room in a package that will fit in the average garage. The Suburban comes in two models, the 1500 and the heavy-duty 2500, both offering two- and four-wheel-drive configurations. The standard engine in the 1500 is the 285  Vortec 5300 V8. New upgrades this year allow this engine to run on gasoline/ethanol mixed fuels that burn cleaner than ordinary gas. The more robust 2500 comes standard with a 320-horsepower 6.0-liter V8, with an 8.1-liter V8 optional. The larger 8100 eight-cylinder produces  340 horses and 455 lb-ft of torque for heavy-duty towing applications. All models use electronically controlled four-speed transmissions with a tow-haul mode that reduces gear hunting for more predictable performance while towing heavy loads.  Recent improvements in frame and body stiffness have given the Suburban remarkably improved ride and handling characteristics. Four wheel disc brakes with ABS are standard on all models. The 1500s are equipped with a five-link coil-spring rear suspension that isolates the road so well you'll forget you're in a nearly three-ton SUV. The suspensions on 2500s are built for strength, employing a stiffer leaf spring setup in the rear that enables them to tow up to 12,000 pounds when properly equipped. All Suburban interiors are spacious with solid ergonomics. There's room for nine if you stick with bench seats, but ordering the optional captains chairs drops capacity to only seven passengers. Standard features on LS models include dual front and side airbags for the driver and front passenger, cruise control, remote keyless entry and a nine-speaker AM/FM CD stereo system. New for this year on LS models are standard six-way power driver and front passenger seats, heated outside mirrors, exterior side steps that make getting in and out easier and the HomeLink system that can be programmed to control automatic garage doors or community gates all from one keypad. Uplevel LT models add the OnStar communications system, electronic climate contro, and heated leather bucket seats up front. Carrying the torch as the longest surviving nameplate in the business, the Suburban continues to provide the basic features that people look for in a full-size SUV: plenty of passenger room, stout underpinnings and a strong drivetrain.

Too much of it can lead to lengthy research sessions,  sleep-reducing stress and crippling indecision. But when it comes to 2022  model-year compact cargo vans, Americans can select between just three models:  the Ford Transit Connect, Mercedes-Benz Metris and Ram ProMaster City. (Guess  which one commands a significant price premium.) 
There  are some good reasons to settle on the Ford. It comes in two different lengths  with two different rear door configurations and two different engine choices.  The breadth of choice allows cargo van buyers to better tailor a Transit  Connect to specific business requirements. Plus, Ford offers Transit Connect  Cargo owners access to a variety of fleet management data, telematics and  smartphone app services. This helps owners keep track of vehicles and their  drivers, monitor maintenance requirements and more. 
Where  the Transit Connect falls short is with regard to capability. In  short-wheelbase format, the Transit Connect cannot match the Ram ProMaster City  for cargo space and payload rating. In long-wheelbase specification, the Ford  comes up well short of the Mercedes-Benz in these areas as well as towing  capacity. But as long as these shortcomings won't impact your needs for a cargo  van, the Transit Connect makes sense. It's  worth picking the XLT trim to get a  Transit Connect Cargo that you won't mind spending lots of time driving.

There are also more advanced powertrain control modules for the other gas engines in the Savana line, and an improved torque converter for the 4L80-E four-speed automatic transmission. Other changes for 2001 include more robust door and ignition locks, upgraded audio systems, quieter alternators and longer-lasting brake pads. How to you choose between a Chevrolet or GMC full-size van? Which dealer is closest to your house? They're basically the same vehicle. They both stack up well against the formidable Ford Econoline and ancient Dodge Ram Van, so if the Savana provides what you need in this kind of vehicle, buy it. When the then-new Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van. The GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced way back in 1971 (when vans were still groovy), and sold steadily until they were finally discontinued. Competition and safety regulations had forced GM to redo the big vans for '96, but by then Ford had already re-engineered its Econoline and Club Wagon twice! To help distinguish GM's all-new, rounded-off design, GMC rebadged its new van Savana.Savana is available in 135- and 155-inch wheelbases, three weight series (1500, 2500 or 3500) and as either a passenger van for retail customers or as a cargo van for commercial use. Cargo vans come with stripped-down interiors, ready for upfitting with tool racks or parts bins. Passenger vans are available with seating for eight, 12 or 15 people, depending on wheelbase, and in two different trim levels (base SL and luxury SLE). There's even a choice of side-entry doors: a slider or a set of 60/40 hinged doors. GM's full-size vans feature flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard four-wheel antilock brakes and dual airbags. Front foot- and legroom is adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of travel. Front air conditioning and rear heat ducts are standard. The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet and storage for items like CDs and cassettes. Inside the short-wheelbase Savana, you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the extended version provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume with the rear seats removed. Rear hinged doors open a full 180 degrees for easy loading and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened. For hauling, gross vehicle weight ratings of up to 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase.The base engine is a 200-horsepower Vortec 4300 V6. Optional motors include a 220-horse Vortec 5000 V8, the venerable 255-horse Vortec 5700 V8, and GM's new Vortec 8100 Big Block V8 that makes 340 ponies and a whopping 455 foot-pounds of torque. Also available is a robust 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 good for 195 horsepower and 430 foot-pounds of torque. GM's heavy-duty 4L80-E transmission handles all the shifting chores.Savana's styling is rounded and bulbous, with a broad front end that mimics GM's truck family and a high-arched rear with tall, thin taillights mounted up along the D-pillars. Easily as odd-looking as the old Lumina minivan's high-mounted rear lamps, the round-topped rear end and sheer size of this van make it seem as if you are looking at the back end of some sort of commuter train car. But since most retail buyers have moved to minivans and much of the full-size van business has centered on converters and fleet use, Savana's styling takes a back seat to its modern mechanicals and long service life.",V6 cylinder ,215," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 4-speed automatic

Balancing the right amount of  bling with artful detailing and proper proportions, the Q60 easily stands out  compared to more staid-looking German coupes.  Unfortunately,  things start to go downhill after that. Inside, you'll find quality materials  in some of the top Q60 trim levels, but the overall design looks tired and  dated. Luxury buyers seeking a high-tech interior will be disappointed, for  instance. Just this year, Infiniti finally got around to updating the car's  dual-screen InTouch infotainment system. It now supports Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto smartphone integration and a Wi-Fi  hotspot connection, but it's still dated and frustrating to use.As  for the sporty bits, the Q60's standard turbocharged V6 delivers effortless  power and acceleration. But there is little evidence of the engine note, a key  component of enthusiast driver satisfaction. For maximum performance, you'll  want to go with the Red Sport 400 trim, which is more powerful and has a  performance-tuned adaptive suspension. Still, it can’t quite match the level of fun you’d have in other luxury sport coupes.Overall,  the Germans know how to get the little luxury and performance details down  best. The Audi A5/S5, BMW 4 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class are easy to  recommend over this Infiniti. Unless, of course, you want eye-catching design  or prefer to drive something different from what everyone else buys. In that  case, the 2020 Q60 is worth checking out. If  you're buying a Q60, we recommend the 3.0t  Luxe trim level. It offers the most flexibility in terms of price and  equipment. You can get the Luxe trim with everything Infiniti offers for the  Q60 except for the top Red Sport 400's performance upgrades and optional  ProActive package. We suggest avoiding this ProActive package on the Red Sport  400, if that's what you're getting, since it has a different steering system  that completely lacks feel for the road and reduces the fun you'll have driving  the Red Sport 400.",V6 cylinder ,142," 295 lb-ft @ 1,600 ",, 7-speed shiftable automatic

There are now two models -- Miata and Miata LS -- and three option packages. A six-speed Miata Special Edition will also be available by spring 2000. As much fun as you can have while driving with your pants on. Financially, it certainly pays to buy in bulk. To own a big and bad 2000 Ford Excursion, you'll have to pay only about $5 per pound (based on MSRP for a base model). To own a lithe 2000 Mazda Miata, you'll have to pay close to $9 per pound. But hey, sometimes you just have to pay more to get the good stuff.While it seems strange to pay over $20,000 for a Miata, the price is still considerably less than those asked for newcomers like the BMW Z3, Mercedes Benz SLK, Porsche Boxster, and Honda S2000. And while the Miata might not be able to match these cars' absolute performance numbers, it certainly equals or exceeds them in the intangibles.The Miata is about simplicity in design and operation. It's about having fun behind the wheel. It's about feeling free and young on warm summer nights. Not a serious car, the Miata, but that's part of its charm. Redesigned from the ground up in 1999, the 2000 Miata is faster, more rigid, and more functional than the previous generation. But it doesn't stray too far from the original Miata's heritage of offering reliable and fun transportation.Though the Miata's trunk is miniscule when compared to what can be crammed into the latest SUVs, the Miata can handle daily commuting or weekend getaways. The shifter moves with quick and short precision and all of the switchgear is easy to reach and use.The option packages have been altered for 2000, but the same basic equipment is still available. Mazda is also offering a limited production run (3,000 units) of Miata Special-Editions. The Special-Edition includes a six-speed manual transmission, a Torsen limited-slip differential, Mahogany Mica paint, 15-inch alloy wheels, a 200-watt Bose stereo, uniquely colored leather seats and top, and various interior trim upgrades.Droning trips on American interstates are not the Miata's forte. But with a lowered top and an open road, the Miata has few equals. The 140-horsepower, 1.8-liter engine is perfectly matched to the suspension and steering. The Miata is simply a joy to pilot on curving roads. When equipped with the 15-inch wheels and the suspension package (which includes items like a Torsen limited-slip differential and upgraded shock absorbers), the Miata's performance envelope is higher, but some fun is lost in not being able to adjust the tail easily via the throttle.In our opinion, you can utilize 90 percent of the Miata's abilities under normal driving conditions, while a BMW Z3 2.8 driver is lucky to experience 60 percent of that car's potential most of the time. From this perspective, the Miata is a better value and the reason why it continues to be on Edmunds.com's Most Wanted list.",Inline 4 cylinder ,160," 119 lb-ft @ 5,500 ",, 5-speed manual 
Toyota,toyota camry,1996,toyota camry 1996,,,4.6,"The 1996 Toyota Camry remains virtually unchanged from last year's model.  Minor engine adjustments mean that the four-cylinder is fully compliant with all on-board diagnostic standards, and is now certified as a transitional low emission vehicle power plant.  Additionally, the interior of the DX line gets a new seat fabric, the LE Sedan is available with a leather package, and the Wagon can now be ordered with a power-operated driver seat. The 1996 Toyota Camry makes a lot of promises and delivers on most of them.  Reliability and ergonomics remain the cornerstone of Toyota's commitment to the U.S. market and the Camry exemplifies both of  these.The Camry is designed to fill the needs of the family; it does so in a way that doesn't leave consumers wanting.  Interior space is adequate, and allows comfortable seating for five; backseat passengers will appreciate the scalloped front seats which creates more knee room.  Trunk space is generous and the liftover height is not too imposing.  Since this is a Toyota, gauges are laid out in a logical manner and all of the controls are within easy reach.  High quality fabrics and supportive seating areas guarantee that a long distance ride will be comfortable.Unfortunately for the Camry, exterior styling doesn't match up to its comfortable interior.  Despite a minor facelift in 1995, the Camry hasn't undergone any real change since its overhaul in '92.  This doesn't mean that the Camry is exactly ugly, just that it is beginning to look a little dowdy next to its competitors.This brings us to our main gripe about this car.  We know that it is dependable, comfortable, and well engineered, but for the price, (around $22,000 for a base V6 and much higher for the SE or XLE with any options) you can get into a fun-to-drive BMW 318i, a stylish Ford Taurus, or an affordable Mazda 626.

The Transit Connect  is more utilitarian and intended more for business use, such as shuttling  clients to the airport. It doesn't have the kind of creature comforts you'd  find in a Honda Odyssey, but there are plenty of third-party upfitters that  could customize the interior to your specifications. 
If  you have the need for a Transit Connect Passenger Wagon, we suggest you act  quickly since it's set to be discontinued at the end of the 2023 model year.  Your choices in the class are also few, with the Mercedes-Benz Metris following  Transit Connect out to pasture and the Ram ProMaster City's discontinuation  last year. So far, it's not clear if there will be a replacement from Ford. For  2023, the Transit Connect Passenger Wagon lineup has also been narrowed.

If  you're deciding between the Mercedes-Benz Metris and the Transit Connect, there  are advantages and drawbacks to both. The Metris is more powerful, can seat up  to eight passengers and is nicer on the inside. The Transit Connect, on the  other hand, is cheaper to purchase and operate. Either will adequately fulfill  duties as a business shuttle, but if you're looking for a more typical family  minivan, check out the Honda Odyssey or Kia Carnival.

For years, the Ford Explorer has been the best-selling sport-utility vehicle in this country, but in 1992 a new challenger called Grand Cherokee arrived to try and wrest the sales crown away from the champ. It was not successful. However, it did outsell every other sport utility on the market, and became the Explorer's biggest threat.Indeed, this Jeep has the most car-like feel of sport utilities, and is among the most stable on pavement. In fact, with the optional 5.2-liter V8 pumping away under the hood, the Grand Cherokee becomes the Porsche of sport-utes. Equipped with a dual airbag system and four-wheel antilock disc brakes, Grand Cherokee buyers have a long list of equipment to wade through, including three different drive systems (2WD, part-time 4WD, full-time 4WD), four different trim levels (Laredo, TSI, Limited, 5.9 Limited), and a host of luxury and convenience items.The exterior is all hard edges and angles, but is instantly recognizable as a Jeep product and looks rugged. A retro touch we could do without is the location of the spare tire. The Grand Cherokee doesn't have tiny tires, and the cargo area is among the smallest in the class to begin with, so why is the tire in  the cargo area? It should be under the cargo floor, mounted under the truck or placed on a rack on the liftgate. Otherwise, we have few quibbles with this sport-ute.Jeep included several perks with the Grand Cherokee 5.9 Limited for 1998 (the Ferrari of sport-utes). Mechanical changes are limited  to a torque-monster 5.9-liter V8 engine and free-flowing exhaust system, reducing back pressure by 25 percent and making the big engine a little easier on gas.  The interior sports ""premium calf's nap grain"" leather seats, a new Infinity 180-watt, 10-speaker audio system, 60/40 folding rear seat with armrest, and leather trim on the doors, armrests and console.  The 5.9 Limited is nothing if not organic.  The 5.9 Limited exterior is treated to a body-colored side molding, hood louvers, a front grille with a silvery mesh and 16-inch aluminum wheels.Last year, the TSI model debuted, sporting specific alloy wheels, monotone paint in a choice of three shades, dark blue pinstriping, leather seats, high powered audio system and more luxurious interior trimmings.Unfortunately, just as Jeep caught up to and surpassed the Explorer in comfort and safety features, Ford went and squeezed a V8 under the Explorer's hood. Last year, Ford began offering a new overhead cam V6 engine in the Explorer, which puts out 20 more horsepower than the Jeep inline six. The Ford also has more room, a more comfy rear seat and a lower price tag. Plus, you don't have to load cargo around a big ol' tire in the back. The verdict?

Put simply, the Sportback is a regular e-tron with a tapered  rear roofline. It looks sleeker than the regular e-tron but has a little less  rear headroom and cargo capacity. The e-tron — regular or Sportback  version — is one of just a few luxury electric SUVs available.  The  e-tron Sportback matches the power output of the standard e-tron at 355  horsepower and 414 lb-ft of torque. A special Boost mode can be activated to  increase output to 402  and 489 lb-ft, but only for 8 seconds. That was  sufficient enough to propel the standard e-tron to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds at Edmunds'  test track. The Sportback feels just as lively when given the juice, and we  expect it to return similar, if not slightly quicker, times.The  Audi e-tron Sportback has many things going for it. We think it's a bit more  practical and solidly built than Tesla's Model X with a quieter and more  luxurious cabin. But the Tesla certainly has more attractive numbers when it  comes to range, performance and price. The Sportback's loss of rear headroom  and cargo space isn't a huge compromise. But when combined with a higher price,  it's hard recommending it over the more conventional e-tron SUV. Check back for  a full e-tron Sportback rating coming soon. The  e-tron Sportback's base trim, the Premium  Plus, is the one we'd recommend. It comes with a full suite of standard  features, such as heated and ventilated front seats, Audi's 10.1-inch MMI  infotainment screen and the Bang & Olufsen sound system. It also matches  the Prestige and Edition One when it comes to power and range, so there's not  much practical gain in upgrading to the more expensive trim levels.",,172,,, 1-speed direct drive

These include a navigation system, cruise control, side airbags and daytime running lights. There are also two new colors: Brilliant Blue and Blue Moon Pearl. Currently, the 2002 Toyota Prius is the best hybrid on the market, but watch for the upcoming hybrid Civic. With fuel prices hovering around $2 a gallon, hybrid vehicles have been getting increased attention from the American public. Hybrid cars combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor. Since hybrids are still fueled by gasoline, they don't have to be plugged in or recharged. The result of hybrid technology is reduced emissions and improved fuel efficiency when compared to a normal gasoline-powered car. There are currently two available for mass consumption: the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius. While the Insight gets amazing fuel mileage thanks to its lightweight aluminum body and aerodynamic shape, the Prius trades ultimate fuel economy for increased utility. It holds five passengers and a good bit of cargo, meaning it functions as a useable family car.Toyota is keen on pointing out that Prius (on sale in Japan since 1997), and not Insight, was the first mass-produced gas/electric hybrid vehicle in the world. The company held off on introducing the model to U.S. customers until it could gauge consumer interest and boost power levels.An all-aluminum 1.5-liter gasoline engine makes 70 horsepower. Variable valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i) helps maximize engine efficiency while minimizing emissions, and power is put to the ground via a continuously variable transmission driving the front wheels. The electric drive motor is worth another 44 peak horsepower, bringing the maximum potential horsepower output to 114. The Prius operates on either electricity or gasoline alone, or a combination of both. Depending on speed and load, the ratio of power provided by each system is constantly adjusted by electronics to keep the vehicle in its most efficient operating mode. Even then, acceleration is slow; 0-to-60 mph takes 12.8 seconds. We're thinking Prius is for use primarily in the city and not for blitzkrieg runs to Vegas.Driven with care, Prius will achieve 52 mpg in the city and 45 on the highway while meeting squeaky-clean SULEV emissions standards, according to the EPA. With its 11.9-gallon gas tank, the car has a maximum city range of just over 600 miles.A single model is available, loaded with amenities like air conditioning; remote keyless entry; cassette stereo; power windows, locks and mirrors; height-adjustable front seats; and 14-inch alloy wheels. Gauges and controls are located in the center of the dashboard, including an LCD screen that can be used to monitor fuel mileage in real time. New options are available this year, including a GPS navigation system, cruise control, side airbags and daytime running lights.Thanks to a tall stance, seating is upright with plenty of head- and foot room. Toyota likes to refer to the Prius as a ""real car,"" implying that Honda's hybrid Insight is not a real car. If the definition of real is capacity for more than two people and 10 cubic feet of stuff, then they're not fibbing.Whatever the case may be, it is obvious that hybrids are meeting with acceptance in the court of public opinion. Like the Insight, the Prius offers a viable alternative to gasoline powerplants without the limitations posed by electric-only cars like the GM EV1.

Believe it or not, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van lineup when the Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996. The GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced in 1971, and sold steadily until they were discontinued. Competition and safety regulations had forced GM to redo the big vans in 1996 -- heck, since 1971 Ford had re-engineered the Club Wagon and Econoline twice! To distinguish the new design, GMC rebadged the van Savana. The Savana Cargo features flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard antilock brakes and dual airbags. Front foot and legroom is adequate, and the front seats offer a wide range of travel. The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet and storage for items like CDs and cassettes. The Savana is available in 135- and 155-inch wheelbases, three weight series (1500, 2500 or 3500) and one trim level.Inside the short-wheelbase Savana, you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the extended version provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume. Rear hinged doors open 180 degrees for easy loading and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened. Gross vehicle weight ratings of up to 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase.The base engine is a Vortec 4300 V6 making 200 horsepower. Optional motors include the GM family of V8's, ranging from the popular Vortec 5000 to the monster Vortec 7400. Also available is a robust 6.5-liter turbo-diesel V8 good for 195 horsepower and 430 stump-pulling pound-feet of torque.Automatic transmission refinements result in lower levels of vibration and noise. These refinements include a two-piece transmission case that provides powertrain stiffness, software that compares engine/vehicle operating parameters and sets precise transmission line pressure, a deep oil pan which aids durability and fluid life, and an electrically controlled converter clutch which increases fuel economy.Two new exterior colors, Fernmist Green Metallic and Dark Bronzemist Metallic, and one new interior color, Medium Dark Pewter, are available for 1999. Like most products in showrooms these days, the Savana's styling is rounded and bulbous, with a front end that mimics the corporate look carried by most of GM's truck family.

Bmw,bmw x3,2009,bmw x3 2009,"['Responsive handling, first-rate steering, superb power delivery, excellent build quality, abundant cargo space for its size.']","['Relatively stiff ride, priced higher than most competitors.']",4,"The 2009 BMW X3 returns with a new name -- the X3 xDrive30i -- and only minor exterior and interior treatments. The 2009 BMW X3 xDrive30i is an ideal choice for someone who wants a small crossover SUV that behaves like a sport sedan. Any BMW wearing a ""3"" badge has a lot of expectations to meet. As the quintessential entry-level luxury car, the 3 Series defines the category. The 3's SUV equivalent, however, the 2009 BMW X3, makes the family proud. Its sporty handling and steering, powerful engine, added utility and fun-to-drive nature are all BMW hallmarks.The X3 also fulfills the brand's reputation for modern luxury with a long list of conveniences, exquisite comfort, premium interior materials and near-flawless build quality. Add to that the X3's generous seating space (even for taller adults) and spacious cargo area, and you have an accomplished crossover SUV that's well suited for the chores of daily life as well as twisty roads.This isn't to say that the X3 is faultless. One by-product of the superb handling is a less-than-luxurious ride quality. For those who prefer something softer, something like a Lexus RX 350 would likely work out better. The added features and prestige of the BMW brand also make the X3 more expensive than similarly sporty entry-level luxury SUVs like the Infiniti EX35 and Acura RDX. There are also a couple new choices to consider this year: the Audi Q5 and the Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class, both of which follow the same entry-level luxury SUV formula. Overall, however, the 2009 BMW X3 remains one of our favorites, and it's certainly a top pick for anyone hoping for more driving pleasure from an SUV. Powering the BMW X3 xDrive30i is a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine that produces 260 horsepower and 225 pound-feet of torque. Power is routed through either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission with manual shift control. All-wheel drive is standard. In our testing, we managed to accelerate a manual-transmission X3 to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds. EPA estimated fuel ratings for the automatic transmission are 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway and 20 mpg in combined driving. The manual transmission comes in at 1 fewer mpg across the board. Standard safety equipment for the X3 includes antilock disc brakes, automatic brake drying, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, active front-seat head restraints, stability control and hill descent control. Rear-seat side airbags are available as an option. In crash testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the X3 was awarded the highest rating of ""Good"" for protection in both frontal offset and side impacts. The 2009 BMW X3 xDrive30i excels when it comes to handling. Among small luxury crossover SUVs, the X3 has no equal when it comes to arcing along a curvy road, thanks to the superior steering feel, ideal suspension tuning and eager engine power output. However, if what you're looking for is a family vehicle to haul the clan cross-country in maximum comfort, the X3's sometimes stiff ride quality is a detriment. The X3's straight-6 delivers spirited power over the majority of its range, while the automatic transmission's gearchanges are caffeinated in their eagerness. The 2009 X3's interior is attractive and fitted with top-notch materials. The front seats are comfortable and firm, with sufficient support for sporty driving. One annoyance is that the controls for the ventilation, audio and optional navigation can be fussy to operate. You might also be surprised that a rear entertainment system isn't available as a factory option. Rear storage offers up 30 cubic feet of space, and with the 60/40-split rear seats stowed, capacity is upped to a roomy 71 cubes. Options are largely grouped into packages. The sport activity package includes 18-inch wheels, running boards, a sport steering wheel and rear privacy glass. The premium package includes leather upholstery, auto-dimming mirrors, ambient lighting and Bluetooth. This package can also be had with upgraded 16-way power front seats. A cold weather package includes heated front and rear seats. Finally, there's the sport package, which comes with a stiffer sport suspension, sport front seats and steering wheel, and body styling accents.Stand-alone options are also available and include 19-inch alloy wheels with higher-performance tires, a premium audio system, HD radio, a navigation system, a heated steering wheel, adaptive xenon headlights and front and rear parking sensors.",Inline 6 cylinder ,226," 225 lb-ft @ 2,750 ",, 6-speed manual

A limited-edition Harley-Davidson F-150 is available for 2000. The under-8,500-pound GVW F-250 has been discontinued and replaced by the F-150 7700 Payload Group. A new overhead console and left- and right-side visor vanity mirrors are optional on XL models and standard on XLT and Lariat F-150 pickups. A driver-side keypad entry system is available on Lariat models. Chromed steel wheels and 17-inch tires are now available on 4x2 models. A comfort-enhancing flip-up 40/60 rear seat has been added to the F-150 SuperCab. One of our favorite light-duty pickups, especially in Super Crew format. If you're the type of person inclined to jump on the bandwagon, then you better purchase a F-Series truck. Ford's full-size pickup continues to be the top-selling truck in America, with 869,001 new trucks being sold in 1999.There is good reason for this, of course. The F-150's suspension provides excellent on- and off-road articulation, giving the most demanding drivers a quality ride. Open-road driving in the F-Series trucks is equally pleasant due to their precise steering, competent braking and forgiving suspension. A certain amount of ""trucklike"" handling is unavoidable when discussing a...well, truck, but, for something designed to carry cargo and not carve canyons, Ford has created an extremely user-friendly rig. An unexpected bonus is the solid, rattle-free ride. Power choices for the F-Series range consist of a standard 4.2-liter V6, an optional 4.6-liter Triton V8 or the even-larger optional 5.4-liter Triton V8. The V6 and 4.6-liter V8 can be ordered with a manual transmission, while the 5.4-liter comes only with an automatic. Power is acceptable with all of the engines, but the 260-horsepower, 5.4-liter Triton V8 can't match the top V8 engine offered in the GM trucks. If you're looking for maximum stoplight acceleration from an F-150, you'll need to opt for the SVT Lightning.Back in 1997, the F-150's interior was a vast improvement over its predecessor. And as a whole, the F-150 interior is a good one. But as trucks are becoming more mainstream, we find ourselves becoming less forgiving about idiosyncrasies. Our gripes center on a number of ergonomic mishaps, as well as the overall look which tries to be progressive but ends up looking goofy. The round, ""aero"" styling, small radio controls, and overall gauge placement just doesn't work, especially in a truck. We're also not very impressed with the F-150's seat comfort.Where the F-150 excels is its functionality. If you are looking to haul or tow, it doesn't get much better than this. The SuperCab version, with its four doors, offers increased utility. Arriving early to mid-2000 (as a 2001 model) is the SuperCrew. The SuperCrew's cab is 12 inches longer than the SuperCab's to provide even more room. The doors are also larger, to aid entry and egress. To improve passenger comfort, the SuperCrew will also offer an Expedition-like 60/40 rear seat.If you're looking for more style than a regular F-150 can provide, check out the limited-edition 2000 Harley-Davidson F-150. The new Harley-Davidson F-150 is a black monochromatic 2WD SuperCab pickup with a flareside box topped by a hard-shell tonneau cover. It comes equipped with a 5.4-liter V8, special exhaust, and 20-inch, five-spoke cast aluminum wheels wrapped with 275/45R20 Goodyear Eagle GTII tires. Inside, the limited-edition Harley-Davidson F-150 features the famous look of Harley-Davidson accessories, including a dash ornament, black leather seats and trim, a black leather accessory pouch on the center console, and a unique ""spun metal"" instrument cluster.",V6 cylinder ,200," 255 lb-ft @ 3,700 ",, 5-speed manual

Chevy has upped the horsepower rating of the Vortec 6000 to 320, and 360 foot-pounds of torque is now made at 4,000 revs.  A new 8.1-liter engine cranks out 340-horsepower at 4,200 and 455 foot-pounds of torque at 3,200 rpm.  You can maintain a relationship with your mechanic on a less intimate level, thanks to an increase in the recommended oil change interval from 7,500 miles to 10,000 miles. The Excursion may be bigger, but that doesn't mean it's better. Unless you absolutely need the extra space, the Suburban is still our choice for the best all-around full-size sport-utility. In the war of the SUVs, Ford took the lead for largest competitor. But in war, bigger is not always better -- just ask Goliath. While the 2001 Chevrolet Suburban may have David aspirations in this vehicular tete-a-tete, being small isn't part of its character. More importantly, the Suburban was completely redesigned last year, and the engineers took that opportunity to capitalize on their long history of truck building by changing as much as they could. All Excursions aside, this vehicle is big. Coming in at a length of 18.3 feet, the heavy-duty 2500 weighs in at an impressive 5760 pounds -- almost 3 tons of truck. Towering above 6 feet for the four-wheel-drive models, is no less imposing than Ford's monster, which is 7 inches taller. However, 7 inches can make a difference -- a Suburban will fit in a standard garage or a car wash rack. The 2001 Suburban comes in two models, the 1500 and the 2500, both offering two- and four-wheel-drive configurations. The 1500s come with a 285-horsepower, 5.3-liter V8 engine, while the 2500 is equipped with either a 320-horsepower, 6.0-liter V8 or a new 8.1-liter eight-cylinder that brews up 340 horses. All come from the Vortec family of small-block engines and have more horsepower than previous Suburban engines. Fronting a four-speed automatic transmission, the Suburban proves to be a great workhorse.Ride and handling have been vastly improved from the previous Suburbans, with increased body strength and stiffness. The 1500s are equipped with a five-link coil-spring rear suspension, allowing the truck to track better on gravel or washboard roads and giving you more wheel control. The suspension on the 2500s comes with the same rear leaf springs as their Silverado stablemates, giving them heavy-duty towing capacities to go with the strong V8s.The interior is comfortable and convenient. Efficient placement of air ducts and a spare tire located underneath the cargo floor rather than inside the cabin allow for copious amounts of useable space and better movement throughout than comparable vehicles. Well-designed seatback angles, a driver's seat with more positioning options than some near-luxury cars provide and second-row captain's chairs go a long way in providing you and your passengers with a pleasant environment. This Suburban has a lot to offer.

The Quadrasteer four-wheel steering option has been dropped, and the optional camper-style mirrors have been replaced by a folding and extending design with a built-in convex spotter glass. Other changes include slightly updated front-end styling and minor adjustments to trim levels and body configurations.  Powerful drivetrains, stout underpinnings and unique options make the 2006 Chevrolet Silverado a pickup worth considering, but the Ram, F-150 and Titan have it beat when it comes to interior design and overall refinement. Chevrolet's modern full-size pickup has been around in one form or another since the early '60s. Currently in its sixth generation, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500, as it's now called, boasts classic styling and a wide variety of body styles and drivetrains. A perennial competitor to the full-size offerings from Ford and Dodge, Chevrolet generally finishes a close second to Ford in sales, mostly due to the fact that it shares customers with the almost identically equipped GMC Sierra.Typically, combined sales of the two trucks outdo the F-Series. Often first to market with unique innovations, Chevy trucks also offer the OnStar communications system that provides the convenience of 24-hour on-call assistance for everything from tow truck calls to dinner reservations. The Vortec V8 engines are known for their generous power and relatively good mileage when driven with a soft foot.Combine this with a wide variety of cabin amenities, and the 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 presents a compelling package, especially for those who do a lot of towing and hauling. The Silverado is really starting to show its age, however, compared to the newer full-size offerings from competitors, which have the Chevy trucks beaten when it comes to interior design and materials, and overall refinement. We strongly encourage you to try out the competition before you settle on a Silverado 1500. Five engine choices are available for the half-ton Chevrolet Silverado -- a 195-horsepower, 4.3-liter V6; a 285-, 4.8-liter V8; a 295-, 5.3-liter V8; a 310-, 5.3-liter V8; and a 345- 6.0-liter V8 as part of the VortecMAX Package. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on regular cabs with the V6 engine. Optional on that model and standard on all other Silverados is a four-speed automatic. The maximum towing capacity with the 5.3-liter V8 is 9,100 pounds, while the 6.0-liter V8 can pull up to 10,000 pounds. All models come in two- or four-wheel drive. A hybrid powertrain option is available on extended cabs with the 5.3-liter, but the system does not provide any power boost. Its main function is to conserve fuel via automatic engine shutdown and startup at stops, as well as provide on-the-job power through four 120-volt AC outlets. All Chevy Silverado trucks include four-wheel antilock brakes as standard equipment. The Silverado received a rating of ""Marginal"" (third lowest out of four possible rankings) in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's offset crash test. In government crash tests, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 received four stars (out of five) for driver protection in frontal impacts and three stars for the front passenger. The 2006 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 is comfortable enough to be a daily driver, yet it's still powerful enough to use as a dedicated work truck. Acceleration ranges from adequate to vigorous, depending on which V8 you select, and the automatic transmission shifts with authority. The steering feels vague on center, but it's light and precise enough for easy maneuvering. The automatic engine shutdown and startup feature work seamlessly in the hybrid truck. Additionally, the hybrid's electric power steering feels at least as good as the traditional setup.  Inside, Silverado buyers will find a logically laid-out interior, with clear, uncluttered gauges. Materials quality is unimpressive, and build quality, though improved over the last few years, is still below that of the competition. The cabin is roomy, particularly on crew cab models. Regular, extended- and crew-cab body styles are available on the Chevy Silverado 1500, and there are six basic trim levels: Work Truck, LS, LS2, LT1, LT2 and LT3. Designed to be affordable on-the-job companions, Work Trucks offer few amenities, but you do get dual-zone manual air conditioning and an AM/FM radio. LS1 models offer a few more features like cruise control, a CD player and deluxe cloth upholstery. The LS2 adds power windows, locks and keyless entry. The LT1 adds an auto-dimming rearview mirror. The LT2 includes a power driver seat and Bose audio. The LT3 includes steering wheel audio controls and alloy wheels.

Available only with a V6 and an automatic transmission driving power to the front or all the wheels, Highlander will be sold in one trim level with a Limited package listed on the option sheet. An oversized Camry wagon that went equipment- and clothes-shopping at REI. Did you know that one out of every 10 cars and trucks sold in the U.S. is a Lexus or a Toyota? With the new Highlander, Toyota will easily cement itself as one of the best-selling brands in North America. How can we be so sure? Because the Highlander represents an optimum blend of three utilitarian types of vehicles: the station wagon, the minivan and the sport-utility vehicle.Based on the same platform as the Lexus RX 300, which itself is based on modified Toyota Camry mechanicals, Highlander is longer, taller and wider where the wheels meet the pavement than the Lexus. Despite its greater size, the Highlander is lighter than the RX 300, so acceleration should equal or better its upscale cousin. Braking will likely prove impressive, too. Highlander comes standard with four-wheel disc brakes equipped with electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (which maximizes braking power during a panic stop).Highlander is rated to tow 3,500 pounds, when properly equipped. Helping to meet that specification is the same 3.0-liter V6 that resides under the hood of the RX. Making 220 horsepower at 5,800 and 222 ft-lbs. of torque at 4,400 rpm, the V6 features Variable Valve Timing with intelligence (VVT-i). The standard engine, also using VVT-i to maximize power and efficiency, is a 2.4-liter inline four making 155 ponies and 163 ft-lbs. of twist. The four-speed automatic transmission provides a ""snow mode"" for easy starts on slippery surfaces.With 7.3 inches of ground clearance (6.9 on front-wheel drivers) and a fully independent suspension front and rear, Highlander isn't designed to tackle tough terrain. But it'll work great during heavy snowfalls. Toyota's Vehicle Skid Control (VSC) system, which includes traction control, is optional, and is designed to recognize when the Highlander isn't responding to the driver's steering inputs. VSC will then apply selective braking to bring the truck (car?) back under control.In the event it fails (not likely, but possible), Highlander protects occupants with whiplash injury lessening (WIL) front seats, five three-point seatbelts equipped with automatic and emergency locking retractors (ALR/ELR), front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters and ISO-FIX child seat anchors. Daytime running lights and side airbags are optional.Inside, Highlander delivers 38.5 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear 60/40 split folding seat in use, and a whopping 81.4 cubes when it's folded. Air conditioning, CD/cassette combo stereo with six speakers, cruise control, tilt steering wheel, bottle holders, and grocery bag hooks are standard. Opting for Limited trim gives you JBL sound, automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, woodgrain interior trim, alloy wheels with full-size spare, fog lights, privacy glass and other upgraded features.

The 2013 Chevrolet Express Cargo is a willing workhorse for buyers who require the functionality of a full-size van, but more modern competitors could be a better fit for your business. The 2013 Chevrolet Express Cargo is prepared for most  anything you can throw at it. This full-size cargo van has heavy-duty towing  capacity, available doors on both sides, varied engine choices and competitive  prices. A few years ago you wouldn't have thought twice about buying one for  your work needs. But the Chevy Express hasn't changed much over the last 18  years and some competitors have made up that ground.
One such rival is the 2013 Nissan NV,  which has a high-roof option that provides much more space to walk and work  inside the van versus the Express, which still only has one roof height. Another  strong competitor is the 2013 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. The Sprinter only  has one engine available, but its superior driving characteristics and  customization options make the Express seem dated by contrast. Smaller options  like the Ford Transit Connect and the Nissan NV200 have large cargo holds in  smaller and more fuel-efficient packages, which are bound to be compelling if  you run a business that doesn't require a lot of heavy equipment.
Of course, by virtue of its size and strong engine lineup,  the 2013 Chevrolet Express Cargo can still serve you well as a work van. Unless  cost or the availability of a diesel V8 is your primary consideration, however,  there are several newer cargo vans that offer more versatility and refinement than  the Chevy Express. The 2013 Chevrolet  Express Cargo van is offered with a choice of six different engines, starting  with the 4.3-liter V6, which produces 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of  torque and comes standard on rear-wheel-drive 1500 models. EPA fuel economy  estimates are 15 mpg city/20 mpg highway and 17 mpg combined. A 5.3-liter V8  good for 310  and 334 lb-ft of torque is standard on all-wheel-drive 1500  models and is available as an option on rear-wheel-drive 1500s. Fuel economy  with this engine and rear-wheel drive is 13/18/15.
The rear-drive-only  2500 and 3500 come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 that produces 280  and 295  lb-ft of torque. There are several optional engines from here. A  gasoline-fueled 6.0-liter V8 puts out 324  and 373 lb-ft of torque. Another version  of the 6.0-liter V8 runs on compressed natural gas (CNG) and produces 279   and 320 lb-ft of torque. Finally, a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8 is rated at 260   and a robust 525 lb-ft of torque. Fuel economy estimates are not available for  these heavy-duty vans, because the EPA doesn't rate vehicles over 6,000 pounds.
The 4.3-liter V6 and  5.3-liter V8 both come mated to a four-speed automatic transmission. The  4.8-liter V8, 6.0-liter V8 and 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8 are all coupled to a  six-speed automatic.
The heavy-duty  3500-series has a maximum payload capacity of 4,187 pounds, and when properly  equipped, both the Express 2500 and Express 3500 vans have a maximum towing  capacity of 10,000 pounds. All 2013 Chevrolet  Express Cargo vans have antilock brakes and stability control as standard  equipment. Side curtain airbags, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors and  OnStar emergency communications are available as options. Other than affordable pricing, the best reason to look at  the 2013 Chevrolet Express Cargo van is its strong V8 engine lineup. The  Sprinter might have a leg up on fuel mileage, but the Chevy's available  6.6-liter diesel V8 has the highest torque rating in this class, so it's a good  way to go if you're dealing with heavy loads. In other respects, though, the 2013  Chevrolet Express falls short of more modern work vans. Compared to the Sprinter  and the NV, it doesn't handle or steer as well, and these shortcomings will be  especially apparent to contractors trying to maneuver their vans in crowded urban  environments. tility is what's important on the inside of a Chevrolet  Express Cargo. The dashboard and other plastic surfaces are hard, and controls  are simple and easy to use. However, legroom up front is limited by the engine cowling  sticking out from the center of the dash. Items like power windows and power  locks are optional, making it relatively sparse inside if you decide not to pay  for the upgrades. The utility that comes with a Chevy Express doesn't include  too many creature comforts.
Interior room is good, with 237 cubic feet of space on the  standard-wheelbase model (whose interior volume is identical to the Ford  E-Series van). The long-wheelbase Express Cargo provides 284 cubes, approximately  10 feet more than Ford's long-wheelbase van. However, the long-wheelbase Express  still falls 263 cubes short of the largest Mercedes-Benz Sprinter, which is  available with high-roof options that allow you to walk upright in the back of the  van. On the upside, the Express' optional driver-side swing-out cargo doors  offer extra practicality for owners who need to quickly grab equipment or  tools. 
Standard equipment on  the Express Cargo includes 16-inch steel wheels, 60/40-split swing-out  right-side doors, air-conditioning, vinyl upholstery and a trip computer.
Major options include  17-inch steel wheels, heated power mirrors, 60/40-split swing-out driver-side  doors, a sliding passenger-side door, a variety of rear door and window  configurations, a towing package, keyless entry, cloth upholstery, a six-way  power driver seat, front passenger seat delete, cruise control, full power  accessories, a tilt-only steering wheel, remote ignition, Bluetooth, OnStar emergency  communications, a simple two-speaker AM/FM sound system and an upgraded system  with a CD player, satellite radio and a USB/iPod interface.

Now, with the redesigned 2020 GMC Sierra  3500HD, the company fields a legitimate heavy hauler with up to 35,500 pounds  of trailering capacity. That's up from a comparatively low 23,100 pounds with  the previous-generation Sierra 3500HD. 
You'll  need the 6.6-liter Duramax diesel V8 engine to handle loads that heavy. It  makes the same amount of power as it did last year, but it's married to a new  Allison 10-speed automatic transmission that GMC says will help keep the  Duramax within its optimal operating range. Furthermore, the Sierra 3500HD's  more substantial frame plus improved cooling capacity, thanks to a larger  grille and reworked air induction system, contribute to the truck's increased  capability.
New  technology also improves the GMC's trailering capacity. The 2020 Sierra 3500HD  offers an updated ProGrade Trailering system with 15 camera views, including  one that allows the driver to virtually see through a trailer for greater  visibility and maneuverability. Loading the bed is easier thanks to standard  corner-step bumpers and side bed steps, and the available MultiPro tailgate is  the equivalent of a Swiss Army knife, supplying six configurations to assist  with loading, hauling and working. 
Our  main issue with the Sierra 3500HD has to do with the interior. Ford and Ram have taken luxury to  another level in their heavy-duty trucks, and it'd be nice to see GMC put more  design effort into the Sierra's ride comfort and interior quality. But given  the truck's many other strengths, it's easy to recommend if you're looking for  a heavy-duty truck that's well equipped and highly capable. For  maximum variety, we recommend the SLE trim  level. It's offered with all three cab styles, both single and dual rear-wheel  axles, and both the gasoline and diesel V8 engines. The SLE trim also serves as  a gateway to important comfort, convenience, safety and trailering upgrades.",V8 cylinder ,255," 464 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 6-speed shiftable automatic

The 2000 BMW M5 is the king of all performance sedans, a classic for the ages. BMW has finally done it. After constantly improving the current 5 Series platform until it was one of the best sport sedans on the planet, they've taken the segment to an entirely new level with the radical new M5. If you're already a fan of the 540i, prepare to be mesmerized by Bavaria's latest benchmark sedan.Starting with the 4.4-liter block from the 540i, BMW's M Division bumped displacement to 5.0 liters with a bore and stroke job. Compression is set at 11:1 (requiring the use of premium fuel, of course) and the cylinder heads are redesigned to offer greater crossflow cooling. Outfitted with the requisite double-VANOS variable valve-timing system, this engine is good for 400 horsepower and 395 ft-lbs. of torque. Even with the M5's 3,800-pound curb weight, zero-to-60 acceleration happens in a lightning-quick 5 seconds!  But don't expect those times to happen with both hands on the wheel; the M5's only transmission is a six-speed manual.BMW has yet to build a single-purpose production vehicle, and the M5 continues this tradition. Along with Corvette-like acceleration, the sedan features a lower ride height than you'll see on a standard 540i, aluminum suspension pieces, stiffer spring and shock rates, and 18-inch wheels with Z-rated tires. A sport mode switch on the center console will recalibrate the variable-assist power steering for increased road feel and snappier throttle response. When things get too snappy, traction control and electronic stability control are waiting to intervene (unless you've switched them off).While paying 70 large for a performance toy might not sit well with the other half, don't forget to mention all the amenities that come standard on every M5 Sedan. Dual-zone climate control, heated leather seats with leather inserts and eight-way power adjustments, power headrests, a GPS navigation system, a 10-speaker sound system, one-touch power windows, rain-sensing wipers, etc., etc. Remember, you're not just buying a European hot rod, this car is meant for safe and secure family transportation...right?You can customize the interior look of your M5 with a slew of no-cost options. Prefer the Nappa Heritage leather to the Nappa Point leather or the Bruyere Wood Trim to the Burl Wood Trim? Just check the option boxes that appeal to you. You can even delete the rear spoiler to further hide your M5's true intentions. Park Distance Control, a rear sunshade and a rear-seat pass-thru are the only extra-cost factory options, though a BMW CD changer is pre-wired and can be dealer installed for a nominal fee.The M5 represents BMW's most capable performance car yet. It is an uncompromising sport sedan in terms of both ability and amenity.

DSC is designed to automatically correct the yaw on all 7 Series cars, preventing plowing and fishtailing. Last year, the big Bimmer was set to compete with all manner of luxury transport.  The reintroduction of the ""value leader"" short wheelbase 740i allowed BMW to go after lower-priced models such as the Lexus LS400 and Infiniti Q45, as well as its usual target of the Jaguar XJ-6 Vanden Plas and Mercedes S-Class sedans.  The strategy has worked well enough, BMW decided to keep the 740i in the lineup for the 1998 model year as well.The news for this year is the addition of safety equipment to this luxurious autobahn cruiser.  Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) is designed to prevent the 7-series sedans from slipping and sliding across the tarmac by controlling the car's yaw.  If the system detects a steering wheel angle that is significantly different than the angle that the car is heading, one or more of the car's antilock brakes will engage, putting the car back on the proper course.  This, of course, means 7-Series owners' will no longer be able to impress their kids by performing doughnuts in the parking garage of their law firm, but such is the price of safety.The 7-Series sedans come in three flavors.  Those who can't live without will want to check out the amazingly appointed 750iL.  Want a stereo that sounds better than symphony hall?  Check.  Want an anti-theft security system that can put Fort Knox to shame?  Check.  Want a heated steering wheel?  Check.  Want 41 inches of rear legroom?  Check.  There aren't many features in the automotive marketplace missing on this car.  Heck, they even addressed our only gripe by adding a steering wheel to the standard equipment list this ear.  What's not to love?Those on a budget, ha ha, should take a look at the 740i.  Priced $33,000 less than its big brother, the 740i is geared towards buyers who are merely wealthy instead of obscenely rich.  This car has almost everything one could desire, but there are a few items on the option sheet that buyers may want to check.  Nestled snugly between the 750iL and the 740i is the 740iL.  The 740iL offers all of the space of the 750iL, but leaves enough money in the checking account to send your pride and joy to Stanford for a year. The 7-Series long list of standard and optional features includes an integrated cellular phone, all-season traction control, xenon headlights and extra-thick window glass.  Personal safety features include double locked doors, coded driveaway protection, two-step unlocking and the elimination of the passenger door locks--with a car this fine you have to be prepared for some unwanted attention.It is always difficult to choose the ""best"" in a class of outstanding competitors, with entries from Mercedes, Jaguar, Lexus and Infiniti; it seems flippant to say that one of these vehicles is totally superior to the others; but, we know which one we would buy if we won Lotto.

There's a new steering wheel, switchgear, instrument cluster and materials. As a traditional American full-size van, the 2008 GMC Savana Cargo (and its Chevy Express twin) is a capable companion for working men and women across the country. Full-size vans like the 2008 GMC Savana Cargo are redesigned so infrequently, a redo date of 1996 is practically fresh. Having been around for more than four decades, GMC's previous full-size van lived through the 1970s, '80s and half of the '90s via sheet metal changes and updates to the running gear. It assumed today's shape 12 years ago and to celebrate the rebirth, the van's name was changed from Rally Wagon to Savana.A number of important under-the-skin changes took place for 2003, including a wider selection of V8 engines, the first-time availability of all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements -- all of which went a long way toward making the Savana safer and more capable than ever before. For 2008, the interior has been updated again with improved interior materials and switchgear.The 2008 GMC Savana Cargo still outpaces the even older Ford Econoline and certainly warrants consideration for those in need of a cargo van. Naturally, these attributes are most often needed by small businesses and fleet operators. The European-designed and dramatically more modern Dodge Sprinter is pricier than the Savana, but its much taller interior and better road manners make it a much better work vehicle. The light-duty 2008 GMC Savana 1500 cargo van comes standard with a 4.3-liter V6 that produces 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. Standard on all-wheel-drive 1500s and optional on rear-wheel models is a 5.3-liter V8 that makes 301  and 325 lb-ft of torque. Heavy-duty 2500 models come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 that makes 279  (258 in models with a GVWR of more than 10,000 pounds) and 294 lb-ft of torque. Standard on the 3500 and optional on the 2500 is a 6.0-liter V8 that makes 323  and 373 lb-ft of torque. Available on both heavy-duty models is a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8 that produces 250  and 460 lb-ft of torque. All Savanas come with a four-speed automatic transmission. Trailer towing capacities range from 6,100 to a stout 10,000 pounds, depending on the model. All models have antilock disc brakes as standard equipment. In frontal-impact crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2008 GMC Savana Cargo scored five stars (the highest possible). A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2008 GMC Savana respectable ride and handling characteristics. Although GMC's van is still far from nimble, it fares reasonably well in day-to-day driving. And with a pair of V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers come easily, even when you're hauling a heavy load. The 2008 GMC Savana's interior is built for pure functionality, and while it may not be pretty, it gets the job done. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but the footwells remain as cramped as ever. Unlike the Dodge Sprinter, there is no tall roof option that allows a normal-sized person to walk upright in the cargo area. Savana buyers can opt for 60/40-split driver-side doors or dual sliding doors for easy access to the rear compartment. The 2008 GMC Savana Cargo van is a full-size van meant primarily for commercial customers. The standard wheelbase (135-inch) Savana comes in half-ton (1500), 3/4-ton (2500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations, while the extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available on the 2500 and 3500 series vans only. Standard equipment on the Savana Cargo includes air-conditioning, two seats, a theft deterrent system and not much else. Optional choices include swing-out passenger-side access doors (versus the standard sliding door), a passenger-side sliding door, a rear air-conditioner and heater, power windows and locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel, keyless entry and a CD stereo.

Like other Audis, the A5 boasts a  high-quality, tech-rich interior that looks impressive without being  ostentatious. One of the cabin's highlights is a 10.1-inch central touchscreen  featuring clear graphics and a responsive display.  For propulsion, the A5 comes equipped with one of two  turbocharged four-cylinder engines: a base 2.0-liter that makes 201 horsepower  and an upgraded 2.0-liter that puts out 261 horsepower.

There are two ways of looking at the Jeep Cherokee: a classic with a loyal following or an aged warhorse that's past its prime. We'll let you decide. Some things never change and the Jeep Cherokee is one of those mainstays. Unlike its posh and bigger Grand Cherokee sibling, which keeps adding comforts and graceful touches, the ever-practical Cherokee simply keeps on rolling, looking little different now from when it was first introduced in 1984. But that's all going to change with the 2002 model, when it gets its first serious redesign, lifting some styling cues from the Jeep Dakar concept, which sort of looks like a squashed Jeep Wrangler. Not that we fear change--we fear aerodynamic-based change. Watch for the hip-to-be-square Cherokee to go rounded, seriously rounded, soon.However, this year, the Cherokee nabs the redesigned 4.0-liter PowerTech inline six-cylinder, which is said to be quieter, cleaner, and more refined than the previous version it has had since 1987. The optional powerplant makes 190 horsepower at 4,600 and 225 foot-pounds of torque at 3,000 rpm. It also complies with the U.S. low-emission vehicle (LEV) requirements. The standard engine is the wimpier 2.5-liter PowerTech inline four-cylinder, and either engine can be mated to the five-speed manual or the optional three-speed automatic transmission.The Cherokee is one of the few SUVs that can actually balance on- and off-road duties. The coil-front/rear-leaf suspension continues to provide a smooth ride, while the Command-Trac (part-time) and Select-Trac (full-time) transfer cases are still around to help buyers escape far beyond where some of the more luxurious SUVs wimp out. Although if you tend to be city folk, two-wheel drive is still available for 2000.Two- and four-door configurations remain, and four trim levels are at your disposal--Limited, Sport, Classic, and SE.

As the most recent addition to the Dodge truck lineup, the Durango makes quite an entry.  Offering the most cargo space in its class, along with a standard Magnum V8 engine, eight-passenger seating, and three-and-a-half tons of towing capacity, the Durango is one of the most versatile sport-utility vehicles on the market.Remember the Ramcharger? Neither do we, with the help of the Dodge Durango. Based on the Dakota platform, the Durango is Dodge's best-ever attack on the booming sport-utility segment.  And from the looks of things, the Dodge boys have done their homework.  Though 80 percent of its parts are shared, the Durango's frame is actually three times stiffer than its Dakota sibling.Competing directly with the sales king Ford Explorer is no easy task.  But the Durango can seat up to eight passengers, which is one set of triplets more than the Explorer.  It can tow up to 7,300 lbs., which is a full ton more than the Explorer.  The Durango has a minimum of 7.9 inches of ground clearance, and feels plenty capable off the pavement.  With the rear seats folded, it can swallow up to 88 cubic feet of cargo.  Big, strong, and utilitarian; sounds like a winning formula.The Durango is larger than anything else in its class, which explains the expansive interior.  Yet it's noticeably smaller than the Chevrolet Tahoe or Ford Expedition giants, so we can't call it full-sized.  But the niche is filled.  Need more room than an Explorer, Blazer or Cherokee?  Don't want to fork over the price of an Expedition?  Take a good look at the Dodge Durango -- it's the only option.There are now three engines to choose from: a 3.9-liter V6 with 175 horsepower and 225 foot-pounds of torque, a 5.2-liter V8 with 230 horsepower and 300 foot-pounds of torque, and a massive 5.9-liter V8 with 245 horsepower and 335 foot-pounds of torque.  The massive engine is our favorite, but fuel conservation is not one of that motor's strong points.  For the environmentally concerned, go with the 5.2-liter V8.

Its  buttery-smooth V6 engine is another strong point, offering acceleration  comparable to some European rivals yet returning respectable fuel economy, too.  There were some drivability issues with the nine-speed automatic transmission  upon its introduction last year, but a software update this year aims to  provide a solution.  The 2017 MDX receives a significant face-lift,  including a new hood, fresh front and rear fascias, restyled front fenders and  different headlights. This year's MDX is also the first Acura to sport the  brand's diamond pentagon grille, which will come as particularly welcome news  if you weren't a fan of the previous shield-like grille.  Another notable addition is the Sport Hybrid model.  With a gas-electric powertrain similar to the one in Acura's flagship sedan,  the RLX Sport Hybrid, the MDX Sport Hybrid makes more power and returns better  fuel economy than the standard model. And with its adaptive suspension and  driver-selectable dynamic modes (two sport and two comfort modes), the Sport  Hybrid is more agile than it appears. It comes at a significant price premium,  however.    Overall, the 2017 Acura MDX still can't quite match  the upscale feel of European rivals such as the Audi Q7 or Volvo XC90, but the  gap is smaller than ever. Throw in the MDX's practical advantages and the Sport  Hybrid's excellent three-row crossover fuel efficiency, and you've got a top  contender in this class.
What's it like to live with?
Want to know even more about the Acura  MDX? Learn about day-to-day ownership from our editorial team's long-term test of a 2014 SH-AWD with Technology and  Entertainment Packages. How much did we like the MDX's quiet  interior? How was the tech? Was the cargo room sufficient for everyday use? How  was the fuel economy? Learn this and more from our test. Note that the updated  2017 MDX differs from the 2014 model we tested — in 2016, it added a new SH-AWD system, nine-speed automatic, smartphone integration and a hybrid trim — but our  coverage is otherwise applicable.  The MDX is one of the most sensible choices in the midsize luxury SUV segment thanks to a sufficiently powerful engine, plentiful features and impressive handling with the advanced all-wheel-drive system. There are quicker and more luxuriously appointed options, but none match the MDX at its price. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2017 Acura MDX SH-AWD w/Advance Package (3.5L  V6 | 9-speed automatic | AWD). Acceleration is smooth and assertive. Although low-end torque is not this V6's strong suit, the nine-speed transmission does a great job of keeping the revs high at full sail. The MDX hits 60 mph in 6.5 seconds, which is more than respectable but a half-beat slower than the supercharged Audi Q7. Pedal feel is light. We found the MDX's brakes easy to modulate in real-world driving. But at our test track, the initial stopping distance from 60 mph was a longish 123 feet and it got worse from there, with notable brake fade after multiple stops. This could be an issue on long downhill stretches. Of the three steering mode settings, the Normal setting achieves a nice balance between light and precise, while the Sport setting's tighter on-center effort feels best suited for stability at highway speeds. Comfort is ultra-light and a little too loose for our preferences. The MDX's torque-vectoring AWD system is impressive. It whips this big SUV around corners and magically allows it to carve tighter lines than you'd believe it could. We can't imagine the front-wheel-drive MDX being capable of the same. The nine-speed transmission is smoother-shifting for 2017 thanks to a software update, but the auto engine stop-start function still takes too long to react off the line after coming to a stop. The MDX Sport Hybrid's three electric motors promise to enhance the base MDX's modest low-end oomph. The MDX's Super Handling All-Wheel Drive is capable enough, but it's designed more for inclement weather than off-road exploration. The SH-AWD system lacks the adjustable terrain/surface settings that its lesser Honda Pilot sibling provides. There is no hill descent control. The front seats offer all-day comfort along with standard heating and available ventilation (standard on Advance). The high second-row seats require minimal knee bend but are somewhat tight on headroom. The third row is quite snug and best reserved for kids. Sharp, higher frequency bumps are felt through the 20-inch wheels (especially at lower speeds), but body motions are well-controlled and bigger undulations are nicely damped. Wind noise is kept at bay thanks to triple-pane windows. The smooth-revving V6 never feels harsh and stays quiet below 5,000 rpm. There is some mild thumping from the tires over surface changes. Climate controls are split between the touchscreen and a row of buttons and rocker switches. The layout is more logical than in some other Acura/Honda products, but it requires an extra step for certain adjustments. Performance is effective. The push-button gear selector will take some time to adjust to and requires that drivers look down to see what they're doing, which isn't optimal. The same goes for the two-screen infotainment system, which allocates functions between screens in a sometimes confusing manner. Clever single-press buttons slide the second-row seats forward for third-row access, but the resulting pass-through can be a squeeze for adults. Otherwise, access to the front- and second-row seats is good and comparable to others in the segment. A highly adjustable driver seat and a power tilt-and-telescoping steering column are standard on all MDX models, so chances are you'll be able to find a comfortable position regardless of trim level and personal dimensions. The third row will please only kids and perhaps adults of short stature. Still, it's better than the third rows of some other luxury SUVs. The front seats feel spacious in every dimension, but headroom in the second row is surprisingly tight. Tall side windows, an upright windshield and big side mirrors all facilitate visibility, but the second-row seat blocks the rear quarter window. The optional surround-view camera lends significantly more confidence while parking. Everything seems meticulously put together, and the Advance's wood trim adds an air of luxury. However, European competitors still manage to feel more substantial than the MDX, and their cabin designs more elegant. The MDX's cabin features large cupholders and door bins, plus a deep center bin with clever compartment configurations that can accommodate a purse or a tablet. Use of space is commendable. Total cargo capacity is on par with that of other three-row midsize luxury crossovers, and better than two-row models. The ease with which the third- and second-row seats fold flat and provide a level load floor merits praise. The MDX's navigation system is straightforward to use via the rotary knob, with easy zoom and pan functions, but its graphics aren't great. Acura's 10-speaker ELS sound system comes standard on all but the base model, adding a speaker or two with the Entertainment package. Sound quality is strong. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto aside (they aren't offered), the MDX offers responsive smartphone integration, particularly for iPhone users. The standard Siri Eyes Free feature allows you to hear and respond to texts on the go. Acura deserves credit for the MDX's suite of standard active safety features, though we find the adaptive cruise control to be somewhat dimwitted. It's often too quick to hit the brakes and too slow to speed up again. The surround-view camera is effective and easy to recommend. Acura's native voice recognition has always been pretty good for inputting navigation directions, and it's even more powerful when paired to the Siri Eyes Free system for access to functions such as reading and responding to texts. It costs a  bit more, but we think the new Sport  Hybrid is the best pick for an MDX this year. The additional power, better  fuel efficiency and standard all-wheel drive are all worthwhile upgrades. You  can't get the Sport Hybrid as a base trim level, but we like the top Advance  package anyway.   Highlights include  20-inch wheels, a heated steering wheel, a surround-view camera system,  second-row captain's chairs and elegant wood trim. The downside is that this is  the most expensive MDX  you can buy. If  you're drawn to the MDX for its value proposition, a lesser MDX is still  appealing.  Note that  the AcuraWatch safety suite, which used to be a package, is now included in all  models, so all MDX drivers will reap the benefits of features such as forward  collision warning with automatic emergency braking, lane and road departure  warning and mitigation, and adaptive cruise control. Highlights  of the well-equipped Standard package include 18-inch wheels, automatic LED headlights with auto high beams,  heated side mirrors, an electronic parking brake, a power liftgate, a sunroof  and keyless entry and ignition. Inside, you'll find heated, eight-way  power-adjustable front seats (with power lumbar adjustment for the driver),  driver-seat memory settings, a power-adjustable steering wheel, leather  upholstery, tri-zone automatic climate control and an auto-dimming rearview  mirror. Technology highlights include dual dashboard displays (a lower 7-inch  touchscreen and an upper 8-inch regular screen), Bluetooth, five USB ports,  Siri Eyes Free, and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player, Pandora and  Aha compatibility and satellite radio. The Technology package adds niceties such  as 20-inch wheels, automatic wipers, remote engine start, power-folding side  mirrors, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a navigation  system, a color driver information display and a 10-speaker premium audio  system with HD radio. The Advance package turns on the charm with  front and rear parking sensors, LED foglights, automatic engine stop-start, a  surround-view camera system, a heated steering wheel, sport seats with premium  leather and trim, power lumbar adjustment for the front passenger, front-seat  ventilation, natural wood trim, heated second-row captain's chairs, second-row  sunshades and two additional USB ports for the third row. The  Entertainment package can be specified with either the Technology or Advance  package and adds a DVD-based rear entertainment system. If you add it to the  Technology package, it comes with a 9-inch screen and 11 audio speakers; if you  add it to the Advance package, it comes with a 16.2-inch screen (with an HDMI  input) and 12 audio speakers, plus it replaces the captain's chairs with  seven-passenger seating. Lastly, the  all-wheel-drive MDX Sport Hybrid boasts a 31-horsepower advantage over the non-hybrid MDX, with a total of 321  hp delivered via a unique powertrain consisting of a smaller 3.0-liter V6  engine, three electric motors and a seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic  transmission. The Sport Hybrid is available with the Technology or Advance  package only, however.",V6 cylinder ,158," 267 lb-ft @ 4,700 ",, 9-speed shiftable automatic

Witness the 2002 IS 300. After just one year on the fiercely contested entry-level luxury sport sedan battlefield, Lexus has quickly moved to address the IS 300's short list of faults. A five-speed manual transmission is available, and it comes packaged with a sportier suspension than what is offered on the ""regular"" IS 300. The luxury side of the equation has also been upped. A navigation system and an all-leather interior are optional this year, and the rearview and driver-side mirrors are auto-dimming. Safety is also enhanced with the addition of head-protecting side curtain airbags (in addition to the regular side airbags), a BrakeAssist function and a stability control system. And for all of those golden retrievers out there tired of riding around in numbing RX 300s, take notice that Lexus has expanded the IS 300's lineup with a wagon version. Improvements this year make the IS 300 a true sport sedan. We feel sorry for those who couldn't wait and bought '01s. Lexus, traditional purveyor or highly refined but generally characterless luxury automobiles, has been on a mission to change that very image. Have you noticed the subtle change in the company's tagline from ""The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection"" to ""The Passionate Pursuit of Perfection""?Fortunately, there is actually product to back up this change in philosophy, as opposed to some other auto companies whose idea of sport is often a couple of decals and embroidered floor mats.No car in the Lexus lineup comes closer to embodying ""sport"" than the IS 300. Designed to offer the same (or better) spirited driving experience found in stalwart sedans like the Audi A4 and BMW 330i, the IS 300 is a well-built rear-drive sedan that can be had for thousands of dollars less than the competition. The IS 300 looks and acts like a GS 300 that has been filed down and given a sharper edge. Its styling is subtle, angular and aggressive. Standard high-intensity headlights are mounted up front, and the whole shape manages to achieve a low 0.28 coefficient of drag. We aren't fans of the circular decklid-mounted taillights, though, and the clear rear lens covers look too much like the ones you see on your neighbor kid's lowered '94 Accord.The car certainly doesn't drive like an Accord, though. The body structure is extremely stiff, and Lexus has done an excellent job of tuning the suspension to provide sticky handling without hurting ride quality on the street. The IS 300 is an easy car to pilot aggressively, thanks to its responsive steering and braking, nimble size and excellent driving position.Power comes from a DOHC 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine. Other than some minor tweaks, this is the same engine that is used in the GS 300. Equipped with variable valve timing, the engine spins out 215 horsepower at 5,800 and 218 pound-feet of torque at 3,800 rpm. Last year, buyers could have any transmission they wanted as long as it was the five-speed automatic with E-Shift sequential shift mode. For '02, Lexus offers an IS 300 equipped with a five-speed manual as a separate model that also features slightly firmer suspension tuning than the automatic model.Safety is also enhanced this year. Along with three-point seatbelts for each of the five seating positions, front seat-mounted side airbags, and pre-tensioners and force limiters for the front harnesses, Lexus has added head-protecting side curtain airbags and a brake-assist function to improve performance in emergency-braking situations. The SportCross and the automatic sedan also come standard with Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), a system that can help reduce dangerous spins and skids.With a base price in the low 30s, the IS 300 isn't the bargain the LS 400 was when Lexus debuted a decade ago. And with both Audi and BMW offering all-wheel-drive technology in their elegant and smooth-riding compact sedans, not to mention superlative interior materials and manual transmissions, Lexus may find that it still has some work cut out for it as it learns what it takes to tackle Germany's finest.",Inline 6 cylinder ,345," 218 lb-ft @ 3,800 ",, 5-speed shiftable automatic

The 2002 Toyota Tacoma is a capable compact pickup with a variety of body styles to suit most buyers. Has a reputation for reliability, but value in question due to high asking prices. Tacoma. Toyota says it's supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure, but a friend of ours once quipped, ""Obviously, nobody from Toyota has actually been to Tacoma.""  There are three body styles from which to choose: Regular Cab, Xtracab and Double Cab. Each is available with two-wheel or four-wheel drive. Toyota also offers Tacomas with a ""PreRunner"" designation. PreRunners are 2WD trucks that have the looks and heavy-duty suspension of 4WD models.Toyota expanded the Tacoma lineup last year with the Double Cab. This compact crew cab offers four full-size doors and a longer passenger compartment in the hopes of appealing to people who want a pickup and an SUV but can't afford both. In order to keep overall length reasonable for on- and off-road maneuverability, the Double Cab's bed length is shortened to 61.5 inches.For all Tacomas, any of three engines go under the hood. Two-wheel-drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated at 142 horsepower and 160 pound-feet of torque. Tacoma 4WDs and 2WD PreRunners earn a 2.7-liter four with 150 horsepower and 177 lb-ft of torque. Standard on Double Cab and optional on Xtracab models is a 3.4-liter V6 that whips out 190 horses and 220 lb-ft of torque. Toyota also offers a special 2WD S-Runner Xtracab sport truck equipped with the V6, a five-speed manual transmission and a sport-tuned suspension. A supercharger is also available from Toyota Racing Development (TRD) for the V6, boosting output to 260 horsepower. Ask your dealer for details.Interiors are industrial in design, failing to appear modern, but are constructed of high-quality materials. Switchgear is logically placed and easy to use. Larger drivers might find the front seats to be uncomfortable, but the cabin in general is pretty roomy, especially in the Double Cab. Standard features are few and far between, however. Items like air conditioning, cruise control, bucket seats and power windows and locks are all optional. Toyota does offer two optional packages -- SR5 and Limited -- that bundle the most desired features. A TRD off-road package is also available that includes an upgraded suspension, 16-inch tires and a locking rear differential.In terms of safety equipment, all pickups contain dual front airbags with a shut-off switch for the passenger side. Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional. In government crash tests, the Tacoma has not faired as well as other compact pickups.Driving a Tacoma is easy enough thanks to its compact dimensions. Both four-cylinder engines offer adequate acceleration, though you'll want the V6 if you plan on towing. Ride quality can suffer if the TRD off-road package is ordered, but the payoff in terms of enhanced off-road ability is well worth it.Toyota hopes to attract buyers with the handsome styling and rugged image of its Tacoma as well as its reputation for quality and reliability. Generally, we like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents. Most of these Toyota trucks don't come cheap.

XLT Sport/Eddie Bauer/Limited models with 5.0-liter V8s receive a trailer-towing package as standard equipment. The XL is available only for fleet sales, and the XLS replaces the XL Appearance as the base retail model. In spite of its ubiquity, the dated 2000 Ford Explorer can't compete with the other excellent midsize SUVs available. Since its introduction in 1990 as a 1991 model, the Ford Explorer has resided at the top of the sport-utility sales heap. This is totally understandable, as the Explorer combines style, comfort and room in a go-anywhere package. The modern-day Country Squire, some have called it, after the segment-leading station wagon of the 1960s. In 1999, Ford sold 428,772 Explorers.The Explorer's sales success, of course, has to do with America's big appetite for SUVs. But it's also a compliment to Ford, as the Explorer gets just about everything right. The interior instills a feeling of quality that is missing from the Chevrolet Blazer. An organically sweeping dashboard houses radio controls that can be operated without a magnifying glass. Materials in the Explorer look and feel rich.  Rear-seat comfort surpasses Chevy, and entry/exit is easier than the Jeep Cherokee. Explorers offer more cargo capacity than most rivals do, and five passengers can ride with ease.The Explorer's standard 4.0-liter V6 is the smallest engine found in a domestic sport-ute. Acceleration is fine from a standstill, but step on the gas at 50 mph and not much happens. That's not good news when there's a need to pass or merge. To compensate, Ford also offers an OHV 5.0-liter V8 engine that used to power the Mustang GT. While the acceleration with the 5.0-liter motor is improved over the base V6, it gives up a lot in fuel consumption. Fortunately, Ford introduced an optional SOHC V6 in 1997 that offers nearly as much power as the V8. In addition, this engine costs less and offers greater fuel efficiency. We recommend this powerplant over the other two motor choices due to its great power, decent fuel economy and affordable price.Explorers retain a distinctly trucklike character, which could be a bonus or a demerit. They're tough and solid, though steering is a little slow and ponderous and the body leans through tight corners. Braking is excellent and the suspension has a compliant attitude, but Ford's Explorer can bounce around over rough pavement, making occupants regret the Denver omelet they had for breakfast.Ford has a philosophy of building vehicles that everyone can be happy with. Sure, the Jeep Grand Cherokee feels sportier, and the Toyota 4Runner looks cooler, but the Explorer has just the right amount of class and ruggedness to make it America's best-selling off-roader. If you are thinking about buying a sport-ute, chances are you've already checked out the Explorer. If you haven't, do yourself a favor and find out why there are so many of these trucks on the road.",V6 cylinder ,200," 225 lb-ft @ 2,750 ",, 5-speed manual 
Mazda,mazda cx-9,2015,mazda cx-9 2015,"['Responsive steering', 'strong V6 engine', 'spacious interior', 'easy-access third-row seat with room for adults.']","['Middling crash-test scores', 'long rear doors', 'stiff ride with 20-inch wheels', 'underwhelming touchscreen interface.']",4,"The Mazda CX-9 continues virtually unchanged for 2015. In some ways, the 2015 Mazda CX-9 is showing its age. But this roomy three-row crossover SUV is still one of our favorites. Mazda takes its ""zoom-zoom""  ad slogan seriously, infusing the soul of a sports car into every vehicle it  makes, including its large crossover SUV, the CX-9. Despite its generous size,  the 2015 Mazda CX-9 is fun to drive, with responsive steering and surprisingly  agile moves. But that's not why buyers choose seven-passenger vehicles. They  need them to haul the family and their stuff. Don't worry. The CX-9 delivers on  those counts, too. There's plenty of room for the family, with three rows of comfortable  seating and a large cargo hold. It also offers suitable amount of amenities to  keep your brood comfortable and entertained.
On the downside, though, the CX-9 hasn't been redesigned  since its 2007 model year introduction, and this aging does show up in a few areas.  The standard touchscreen is rather small and antiquated (especially given Mazda's  impressive new system found in the Mazda 3), and it doesn't offer access to  smartphone app integration. The middling safety scores also indicate the CX-9  wasn't designed to withstand today's increasingly stringent industry safety  tests. It does offer the latest safety technologies, including blind-spot  monitoring and rear cross traffic alert, but given the priority family vehicle  shoppers place on safety, this could be a deal breaker.
If that's the case, those same shoppers in the market for  a three-row crossover SUV have plenty of good choices. The 2015  Dodge Durango and 2015  Ford Flex don't have quite as much space as the CX-9, but they feature more  upscale interiors, are imbued with their own driving and styling character, and  also offer more vigorous engine options. The 2015 Chevrolet Traverse (and its GMC Acadia sibling) boasts more cargo space and eight-passenger  seating, as well as pleasant road manners. The 2015 Toyota Highlander,  meanwhile, is the most well-rounded of the bunch.  Yet even with its flaws and age, the sporty CX-9 still gets our nod and even  earns a top spot in our 2015  SUV Buying Guide. Available with either front- or all-wheel drive, the 2015  Mazda CX-9 is motivated by a 3.7-liter V6 engine that produces 273 horsepower  and 270 pound-feet of torque. The transmission is a six-speed automatic with  manual shift control. Properly equipped, the CX-9 can tow up to 3,500 pounds.
In Edmunds testing, a front-wheel-drive CX-9 accelerated  from zero to 60 mph in 7.5 seconds, which is decently quick by segment  standards. An all-wheel-drive model needed 8.5 seconds in our testing, though,  so AWD is more of a performance burden than you might expect. EPA-estimated  fuel economy for the CX-9 is on par with that of other large crossovers at 19 mpg combined (17 city/24 highway) for front-wheel-drive models and 18 mpg combined (16 city/22 highway) for AWD models. The 2015 CX-9 comes standard with antilock disc brakes,  stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side  curtain airbags. Touring and Grand Touring models add a suite of electronic  driving aids that include a blind-spot monitoring system, rear parking sensors,  a rear cross-traffic alert system and a rearview camera.
In government crash tests, the CX-9 received an overall four-star  rating (out of a possible five), with three stars for frontal-crash results  and five stars for side-impact safety. The Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety awarded last year's CX-9 its highest  rating of ""Good"" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset crash  test and the side-impact test, but gave it the lowest rating of ""Poor""  in the small-overlap frontal-offset impact test. It also scored only ""Marginal""  (the second-lowest rating of four) in the roof-strength test and for its seat  and head restraint design's whiplash protection in rear-impact crashes.
In Edmunds brake testing, an AWD Grand Touring model came  to a stop from 60 mph in 123 feet, an average showing for this class. The 2015 Mazda CX-9's V6 offers strong acceleration for  both around-town driving and highway passing. The automatic transmission is  also pleasing, with quick and timely shifts.
We also like that the CX-9 is an accomplished highway  cruiser, keeping road and wind noise to acceptable levels for backseat movie  viewing and pleasant conversation. The precise, communicative steering lets you  carve a consistent path, whether you're powering down the interstate or making  time on a rural two-lane road, and the steep rake of the windshield adds to the  sporty vibe. If you're used to a more nimble car, the CX-9 will make the  transition to a large family vehicle much easier.
Although we generally like the suspension's combination  of compliance and poise, we can't recommend the Grand Touring model's 20-inch  wheels, as too much ride comfort is lost in the transition from the standard 18s.  If you stick with the base wheel setup, you'll still have one of the  best-handling big crossovers around, as well as a smooth ride.  The 2015 Mazda CX-9's dashboard features a graceful  waterfall design that flows into the door panels with uncommon flair. Materials  quality is unremarkable -- there's nary a soft-touch panel to be found on the  dash, for example -- but it's all screwed together pretty well. One nice  premium touch is the center console bin, which has a nifty split lid that pops  open like a set of clamshell doors. Otherwise, the CX-9's cabin could use a few  more storage areas here and there.
The 5.8-inch  touchscreen is a mixed bag. We appreciate that it's standard for every  CX-9, but many of today's systems offer larger screens and/or more  user-friendly functionality, as well as access to apps on owners' smartphones. The  CX-9 is clearly behind the times on this count.
The good news is that the CX-9 has plenty of space. In  the first two seating rows, there's ample room even for taller passengers, but  headroom is tighter for those seated in the third row. Happily, the second-row  seat reclines and slides fore and aft to accommodate various passenger  scenarios. Access to the third row is a cinch relative to some other crossover  SUVs, but the large rear door openings that make this possible can be  cumbersome in tight parking spaces.
With its second and third rows folded flat, the CX-9  offers up a formidable 101 cubic feet of cargo capacity: an excellent figure  for this class. 
Standard features on the Sport model include 18-inch  alloy wheels, cruise control, three-zone automatic climate control, a  tilt-and-telescoping leather-wrapped steering wheel, a height-adjustable driver  seat, cloth upholstery, a 5.8-inch touchscreen central display, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, HD  radio, Pandora radio capability, a USB/iPod interface and an auxiliary audio  jack. Packaged as an option are heated mirrors, heated front seats and an  eight-way power-adjustable driver seat with power lumbar.
The Touring model gets that optional package as standard  and adds automatic headlights, a blind-spot monitoring system, rear parking  sensors, a rear cross-traffic alert system, a rearview camera, leather  upholstery and a four-way power-adjustable front passenger seat.
The Grand Touring ramps up the luxury with 20-inch  wheels, xenon headlights, LED running lights, foglights, automatic wipers, a  power liftgate, upgraded exterior and interior trim, keyless ignition and entry,  driver memory functions and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.
Most options are bundled into packages. The Touring trim  is eligible for the Touring Technology package, which includes foglights, a  sunroof, a power liftgate, keyless ignition and entry, a navigation system, satellite  radio, a 10-speaker Bose surround-sound system and the Recreational Accessory  package (available separately, includes roof rails, cross bars, a cargo net and  a stainless steel rear bumper guard). The Grand Touring gets its own Technology  package, which is just the Touring's version minus what's already standard.
Exclusive to the Grand Touring is an optional rear-seat  entertainment package that comes with a DVD player, a 9-inch screen, an  11-speaker Bose surround system, satellite radio (available separately), the  navigation system and a 115-volt power outlet.

A more efficient starter and a stronger steering gear housing have also been added to all gas engines along with flexible fuel capability for the 5300 V8. Not the biggest full-size SUV, but in terms of horsepower, functionality and features, easily the best. When it comes to full-size SUVs, it doesn't get much bigger than the Yukon XL. Coming in at over 18 feet long and weighing almost 3 tons, the XL comes in both half-ton and three-quarter-ton models, with either two- or four-wheel drive. The Yukon XL boasts seating capacity for nine and the ability to tow a 12,000-pound trailer when properly equipped, making it one of the most versatile sport-utes available.  Accomplishing such heroic feats of hauling requires serious muscle under the hood and the XL has the goods. Half-ton models get a 5.3-liter V8 rated at 285 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque, while three-quarter-ton models get a choice of either a 6.0-liter V8 rated at 320 , or an 8.1-liter brute that delivers 340  and 455 lb-ft of torque. GMC is quick to point out that even the smaller 6.0-liter engine boasts a higher horsepower number than the V10 available in the Ford Excursion, while the 8.1-liter engine enjoys a solid 30-point lead in both the horsepower and torque race. An all-new 4L85 heavy-duty four-speed transmission is now standard with the 8100 V8, while a stronger version of the 4L80 four-speed remains standard on all 6.0-liter engines.All half-ton Yukon XL models utilize an independent torsion bar front suspension and a five-link coil-spring rear setup that delivers a satisfying ride whether you're on the highway or off the beaten path. Three-quarter-ton models utilize the same torsion bar setup up front, but rely on two-stage Smooth Ride leaf springs in the rear that provide a comfortable ride while retaining the capacity for heavier loads. An optional trailering package adds even higher-rate springs and retuned shocks for better handling of extreme loads. Buyers can choose between two different trim levels: base SLE or uplevel SLT. SLEs come standard with front and rear air conditioning, aluminum alloy wheels and deep-tinted glass. Add to that power windows, locks and doors; a nine-speaker AM/FM CD stereo; and an electrochromic rearview mirror with an integrated compass, and it's easy to see why these make great family vehicles. Step up to SLT trim, and you'll enjoy leather upholstery, heated driver and passenger front seats with power lumbar and lateral support, electronic climate control and the OnStar communications system. An optional traction control system keeps 2WD XLs on the road when the going gets slippery, and standard four-wheel disc brakes with ABS help stop the big sport-ute quickly in panic situations. Front and side airbags are standard, and LATCH child seat attachment anchors are now provided for more secure fastening of second-row child seats. When it comes to providing plenty of room for a large group of passengers, it's hard to beat the Yukon XL. Although we would like to see higher-quality interior pieces and an overall improved level of fit-and-finish, we still love the big sport-ute. The wide-range of engines and high level of standard equipment make it a nice place to spend time on long trips with the family.

Audi,audi rs-3,2017,audi rs-3 2017,"['Ridiculous power in a relatively compact car', 'Refined interior with excellent materials', 'Lots of high-tech features that are easy to use', 'Aggressive styling without being cartoonish']","['Limited interior storage and cargo space', 'Likely has a stiff ride quality']",5,"The Audi RS 3 has been available in other markets for a few years, but it's finally here in the U.S., to the delight of American performance enthusiasts. Start with a class-leading entry-level  luxury sedan like the Audi A3. Double the power output with a 400-horsepower  turbocharged five-cylinder engine and upgrade the brakes and suspension to  match. Sound like a good idea? Yes, we think so, too. The best part is, this  idea has been realized in the 2017 Audi RS 3.  It benefits from all of the smart design  and tech from the A3, giving it the kind of performance we're used to pulling  out of dedicated sports cars costing much much more. With this in mind, the only  real direct competitor is the BMW M2, which happens to be a staff favorite. The  RS 3 does have it beat on paper with more power and all-wheel drive, so to say  we're excited to test it for ourselves is an understatement. These cars have  the makings of an epic shootout. The Audi A3 is already a class leader for its engaging driving dynamics and chic interior, so what happens when you drop a bonkers 400-horsepower engine in it? Something wonderful, and it's called the RS 3. Edmunds has not yet driven any version of this vehicle. The following is our first take on what's significant about it and what you can expect. The RS 3 is all about performance, and by the specs and firsthand accounts, it's impressive. With 400  and all-wheel drive packed into this small sedan, we expect it to likely out-accelerate the BMW M2. We expect the RS 3's ride quality to be firmer than that of the already stiff S3, but the adaptive suspension should keep it from being overly harsh. If the sport seats in other Audi vehicles are any indication, these seats should provide a good balance of lateral support and comfort. The RS 3 is a stylistically enhanced version of the A3, and its interior benefits from an understated design, tons of features, an easy-to-use interface and excellent materials throughout. Outward visibility is notably excellent, too. The interior pockets and bins are modestly sized with just enough space for your personal items. The trunk tells a similar story, requiring you to fold the rear seats down if you need to transport items like golf bags. Not only does the RS 3 have a ton of features and functionality, but they're easy to operate, too. The available virtual instrument panel enhances the feeling that Audi uses tech in a very smart manner. The 2017 Audi RS 3 only comes in one trim level, so you only have to decide on options. The Technology package adds some of the newest and coolest features, and the Dynamic package should push the performance ceiling higher. We'd probably skip the Dynamic Plus package, though, because it may make the ride quality far too harsh. Standard  features include 19-inch alloy wheels with summer performance tires, automatic  LED headlights, heated and power-folding mirrors, automatic wipers, a panoramic  sunroof, front and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and ignition, adaptive  suspension dampers, selectable drive modes, dual-zone automatic climate  control, auto-dimming mirrors, heated front seats, leather upholstery,  eight-way manual sport seats with power lumbar adjustment, and 40/20/40-split  folding rear seats. Electronic features include Audi's MMI infotainment system,  Bluetooth, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration, a rearview  camera, and a 10-speaker audio system with HD and satellite radio and a USB  port. Most  of the RS 3's options are offered in bundles. The Technology package includes a  Wi-Fi hotspot, smartphone vehicle monitoring and control, a navigation system,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a digital gauge cluster  display (Virtual Cockpit), and a Bang & Olufsen premium audio system. You  can also get the Dynamic package (wider wheels and tires, a sport exhaust and  red brake calipers) and the Dynamic Plus package (a higher top speed, a carbon  engine cover, individual tire pressure monitors, front ceramic brake rotors and  a fixed sport suspension). Stand-alone options are limited to carbon-fiber interior  trim and rear-seat side airbags.",Inline 5 cylinder ,250," 354 lb-ft @ 1,700 ",, 7-speed automated manual 
Volkswagen,volkswagen golf-gti,2015,volkswagen golf-gti 2015,"['Strong and fuel-efficient turbocharged engine', 'sporty handling', 'versatile and roomy hatchback design', 'high-quality interior.']","[""Automated manual transmission's sleepy responses in slow-moving traffic.""]",4.3,"The Volkswagen Golf GTI has been completely redesigned for 2015. The redesigned 2015 Volkswagen Golf GTI might not look much different on the outside, but a stronger engine and enhanced handling make it even more fun to drive. It's an excellent choice for a performance-oriented hatchback. Few cars can be both fun and practical, but the Volkswagen Golf  GTI has done it for more than a quarter of a century. Combining the sensible nature  of the Golf hatchback with various performance enhancements, the GTI is the  iconic hot hatch for the everyman. Some GTIs have fared better than others  through the years, but we're pretty sure the 2015 Volkswagen Golf GTI will rank  as one of the best yet.
This year's full redesign is one reason why. Visually, the  changes are subtle, with reshaped headlights and taillights as well as sharper  creases on the body's side. The new GTI is just  a bit longer and wider than the outgoing one, but a new sloping hood design  gives it a shorter, more dynamic look. Inside the differences are also  slight. Rear seat and cargo space increase slightly, and that's a good thing. The  GTI's interior was already one of the better ones in terms of design and  quality.
More substantial changes lie underneath the steel skin. VW has introduced an all-new body structure with revised  suspension tuning to give the GTI more athletic handling this time around  (albeit with an unfortunate decline in ride quality this year). Hit the gas and  the new GTI moves faster, too. The turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine  now generates 210 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, gains of 10  and  51 lb-ft compared to the outgoing model. An optional package adds 10 more   along with larger front and rear brakes and an electronically controlled mechanical  limited-slip front differential -- a GTI first -- that can help the hatch power  out of turns more quickly. An optional adaptive suspension is another new  addition.
Put it together and you've got the GTI's traditional  strengths of refinement, practicality and quality, but now with enhanced  agility and performance. VW isn't the only brand vying for your hot hatch  dollars, of course. For rowdier acceleration and handling, the Ford Focus ST sets the standard. It's noticeably less expensive, too. We're  also fond of the smaller but highly customizable 2015 Mini Cooper  S, which was recently redesigned and offers tech-oriented  features you can't get on the GTI. The 2015 Subaru WRX is  a good option if you want all-wheel drive.
Regardless of your personal hot hatch preferences, though, the  GTI's well-rounded excellence should merit a place on your must-see short list. The front-wheel-drive 2015 VW Golf GTI uses a turbocharged 2.0-liter  four-cylinder engine that produces 210  and 258 lb-ft of torque. The optional  Performance package increases output to 220 . A six-speed manual transmission  is standard and a six-speed automated manual (VW's  DSG) is optional. 
During Edmunds testing, a four-door 2015 VW Golf GTI with  the DSG transmission and Performance package went from zero to 60 mph in 6.1 seconds.  That's slightly quicker than average for a sporty compact car, and more than a  second quicker than a standard Golf. A two-door GTI with the manual  transmission (and no Performance package) reached 60 mph in 5.9 seconds.
The EPA's  estimates for fuel economy are 28 mpg combined (25 city/34 highway) for the manual transmission and 28 mpg combined (25 city/33 highway) for the DSG. Standard safety features for the 2015 VW Golf GTI include  antilock disc brakes, automatic hill-hold, stability and traction control, front  side airbags, side curtain airbags and a driver knee airbag. A post-crash  braking system is also standard and automatically applies the brakes after an  impact to reduce the likelihood of a secondary crash. VW's Car-Net emergency  telematics is standard with features that include automatic crash notification,  roadside assistance, remote vehicle access, stolen vehicle location and  geo-fencing (which allows parents to set boundaries for teenage drivers). A  forward collision warning system and front and rear parking sensors are  optional.
In Edmunds tests, a Golf GTI fitted with optional summer  tires came to a stop from 60 mph in 105 feet, which is an excellent distance  and shorter than average for an affordable performance car with summer tires.
In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash testing, the  related 2015 VW Golf earned the highest  score of ""Good"" in the moderate-overlap and small-overlap frontal-offset  impact tests. It also earned a ""Good"" rating in the side-impact, roof-strength  and seats/head restraints (whiplash protection) tests. The 2015 VW Golf GTI lives up to its hot hatch heritage with  sharp handling and steering, brisk acceleration and a rather burly engine and  exhaust note. These are all best exploited on a tight and twisting mountain  road, where the GTI playfully bounds from curve to curve, all while instilling  plenty of driver confidence. Though all 2015 GTIs are great fun to drive, the  Performance package version is worth considering if you're planning to take on  challenging roads or the occasional track day. The limited-slip differential in  this package helps pull the car's nose around the apex of a turn, resulting in  quicker progress for more advanced drivers.
Either the slick-shifting manual or the well-executed DSG  automated manual transmission is a good choice. Especially compared to  traditional automatics, the DSG is quick and smooth, and its downshifts are  rev-matched with perfection. However, we've found that DSG can be frustratingly  slow to respond to your gas pedal inputs when you want to accelerate quickly  from a stop or you're trundling along in heavy traffic.
We're also not as fond of the way the new GTI rides. Perhaps  in VW's quest for greater handling precision, the GTI has lost some of its  hallmark ride comfort that used to make it such an appealing daily driver. Although  it's still comfortable enough for long drives, the GTI can get pretty harsh on  rough pavement. Competitors like the Ford Focus ST and Subaru WRX provide an  equally thrilling driving experience and have a marginally better ride quality.  Models with the optional adaptive suspension are more forgiving over imperfect  pavement, but not enough so to justify the added expense if you weren't already  planning to get a GTI with the Performance package. We've yet to drive a 2015  Volkswagen Golf GTI with the standard all-season tires (summer tires are  optional across the board), and it's indeed possible that the less aggressive  rubber will translate to a smoother ride. The 2015 Volkswagen GTI's interior features well-grained  materials that are soft to the touch and a cabin design that is, while somewhat  austere, comfortable and even sporty, thanks to bold red stitching. Buttons and  switches are placed close to the driver and offer intuitive, simple control.  The 5.8-inch touchscreen is a tad small compared to others, and the graphics aren't  as crisp as on some competitor screens, but it works well and is easily read at  a glance. But the large iPhone connector plug can require you to remove the  phone's case and remains a critical gripe, especially with the ubiquity of  simple USB ports. The navigation system also disappoints with its inability to overlay  traffic information on the map. Instead, it lists traffic incidents in the  vicinity.
Front seats provide ample support and comfort, even during  long-distance driving stints, and not at the sacrifice of rear seat passengers.  The new GTI's added leg- and shoulder room make the small hatch feel big,  although the low-mounted rear seat cushions are best suited to smaller  passengers. Up to 22.8 cubic feet of cargo can be accommodated behind the rear  seats, while folding the seats flat provides a class-leading 52.7 cubic feet of  space. 
Stepping up to the GTI SE trim adds a sunroof, automatic  headlights and wipers, keyless ignition and entry, a rearview camera, leather  upholstery and a Fender premium audio system. The range-topping GTI Autobahn  trim tops off the features list with a navigation system, a 10-way power driver  seat and dual-zone automatic climate control.
The optional Driver Assistance package adds front and rear  parking sensors and a forward collision warning system. The Lighting package gets  you bi-xenon headlights, LED running lights and cornering lights. You can also  select 18-inch wheels with summer tires or the Performance package (late  availability) that includes an electronically controlled mechanical limited-slip  front differential, larger front and rear brakes and an additional 10 .

Chevrolet,chevrolet tahoe,2000,chevrolet tahoe 2000,"['Completely redesigned, strong body and frame, more powerful engines.']","[""Not a luxury-driving experience, won't impress your friends.""]",4.5,"The engineers at Chevy redesigned the Tahoe from top to bottom, making it safer, more powerful and a more pleasurable vehicle to drive. If you're looking for a powerful, roomy, and easy to drive full size SUV, the Tahoe is a hard to beat. Chevrolet is calling their new Tahoe a ""real"" sport utility, implying that sport-utes are more about getting things done than doing them in style. With nearly every automaker offering an SUV these days, it takes a lot of effort to be unique. However, despite differing opinions of what does and what does not constitute a good SUV (i.e., BMW's X5), the 2000 Tahoe has a whole lot going for it. This is courtesy of the full redesign it got this year. For 2000, the Tahoe is stronger, easier to drive on and off the road, and gets some new seats and safety features.Available with either two- or four-wheel-drive, this Tahoe has a redesigned frame and body that are similar in appearance, but stronger and more rigid than previous models. The body is made of more durable exterior sheetmetal, thanks to improved corrosion protection and stronger dent-resistant steel. The engineers rethought everything, even redesigning the door hinges so they last four times as long and putting a unique crush cap on the front so you don't have to replace the whole front end in a moderate-speed accident with a slow-moving tree. Under the hood, the 2000 Tahoe comes with Chevy's powerful new Vortec V8 engines, offering 275 horsepower from the 4.8-liter motor on the base model and 285 horsepower from the 5.3-liter motor on the LS and LT models. All that power runs through an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. While these engines are stronger than last year, they lead their competition in fuel economy and are compliant with low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards, making them safer for driving in Mother Nature's backyard.The powertrain has been beefed up for 2000, offering a more durable rear axle, strengthened differential case, and stiffer axle shafts. But Chevy didn't bump up its off-road durability at the expense of the highway drive. With a 400 percent increase in body-mount structure stiffness and a five-link rear suspension, this redesign provides a smoother, quieter and more stable ride on virtually all road surfaces.Inside all the new metal is an innovative 50/50 split third-row seat that provides greater cargo flexibility and the possibility to boost passenger capacity to nine. Those eight other people will be better protected in the 2000 model because this Tahoe has a host of advanced safety features, including four-wheel, ventilated disc antilock brakes, front-seat side-impact airbags, seat-mounted safety belts in the first- and third-row outboard positions, and an energy-absorbing foam on the interior surfaces, reducing the chances that your less-than-bright friends will hurt their heads while exiting. Built on the same foundation as the Chevy Silverado pickup, this Tahoe is a tough SUV, redesigned to be stronger and safer than it's ever been. There are plenty of reasons to buy an SUV these days and many of them have nothing to do with unpaved roads. If you want a sport utility that can handle a ditch better than many, the redesigned 2000 Chevrolet Tahoe should be on your short list.",V8 cylinder ,275," 290 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 4-speed automatic

For 2021, GMC looks to  change that, and it gives the top of the line Denali enhanced cabin materials  and a new grille reminiscent of the one on the full-size Sierra 1500 pickup.  
There's  also a new AT4 trim level. It's mostly just a replacement for the previous All  Terrain trim level, but it does come with all-terrain tires and a special  suspension to improve the truck's off-road capability. Both speak to the  truck's versatility, provided you're looking to buy a Canyon in one of its more  expensive trims.  We  usually wouldn't go for the most luxurious trim level on a pickup truck, but we  think the Canyon is best in its newly enhanced Denali trim. We like the long list of standard equipment included  for the price as well as the simplicity it brings by allowing you to bypass  ordering multiple equipment packages. We like its standard V6 engine too. The  optional diesel engine is likable, but we don't think its substantial price is  worth the gain in fuel economy. How does the Canyon drive? We tested the Denali trim level, which comes with the 3.6-liter V6. It delivers solid thrust and pulls with authority. Our test truck reached 60 mph in 6.9 seconds, which is quick for a midsize truck. It also steers and brakes with commendable precision and composure, and car-like handling is one of the Canyon's strengths.

      The Canyon can also mix it up off-road, with decent articulation and a two-speed transfer case standard on 4WD models, but you'll need to remove its unnecessary, low-hanging chin spoiler first. How comfortable is the Canyon? While the Canyon is unmistakably a pickup from the outside, the cabin comfort and features are far from basic pickup fare. The Denali trim's seats offer good comfort on long drives despite the firm backrests and not much lateral support. The rear seats, though, are fairly flat and upright. Adults won't want to stay back there too long.

      Fundamentally, the Canyon is refined and road trip-ready, unusual traits for a midsize pickup. It offers good noise isolation and effective climate control. And the ride, while slightly bouncy if there's no cargo in the back, settles down nicely once you drop a few hundred pounds in the bed. How’s the interior? The Canyon's interior is laid out logically, with simple and effective knob interfaces, plenty of space up front, and a wide range of seating adjustments. This alone sets the Canyon apart from its Tacoma rival, which has a fairly narrow range of comfortable driving positions. The rear seats offer an abundance of headroom, but taller passengers may come up short on legroom.

      The tall windows and large windshield give drivers a commanding view of the road ahead, although rear-quarter visibility is limited. The rearview camera helps while backing up. The Canyon's tall seats make getting in and out nearly as much work as entering and exiting a full-size truck. The side step bars help here. How’s the tech? The Canyon infotainment system is easy to use and feature-rich. It has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration as standard. The optional Bose system is a nice upgrade, but volume doesn't get as high as we'd like. For device charging, there are two USB ports up front and two in back. GMC's Wi-Fi hotspot setup is also one of the easier systems to use as it offers a 4G LTE connection and can handle up to seven devices.

      Forward collision alert and lane departure warning are optional and a bit sensitive, but they work as advertised. Otherwise, we'd like to see the inclusion of blind-spot monitoring on the options list. How are the towing and storage? The Canyon V6's maximum tow rating of 7,700 pounds is among the best you'll find for a midsize pickup. The bed is somewhat basic and lacks some of the extra features (such as additional tie-downs) of its rivals, though you can add a variety of dealer-sourced accessories to spruce it up. The tailgate lip and bed sides are high and can make loading difficult, although handy bumper steps address this issue somewhat.

      When it's time to haul things inside instead of people, the backseat-folding design is inferior to the competition. The rear seats flip up, but the floor is marred by obstructions and you can't lay items flat. There are enough storage nooks for small items, but some competitors offer more. Child seats can be accommodated, but the Canyon doesn't make it easy to install them. How’s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates the V6-powered rear-wheel-drive Canyon at 21 mpg in combined city/highway driving. Our driving experience suggests you'll be able to match these numbers in real-world driving without too much difficulty. Is the Canyon a good value? The Denali trim, which we tested, makes the Canyon one of the pricier midsize pickups on the market. For all but the most creature-comfort-obsessed buyers, it isn't worth the extra cost over a well-equipped and mechanically identical Chevrolet Colorado. You're buying a little extra cush, a badge and an image, not a more capable Canyon.

      But five years (or 60,000 miles) of roadside assistance and a complimentary service visit are useful, while the five-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty is typical for the class. Having fun with trucks generally involves some off-roading, but the Canyon makes a compromise in terms of front ground clearance versus competitors such as the Tacoma or Frontier. The Canyon AT4, with its extra off-road hardware, should give some added ability, but the low front fascia still limits the approach angle. It's removable, but it's a hassle.

      On the road, the Canyon is quite competent. It's not quite as refined as the Honda Ridgeline perhaps, but the Canyon is more capable than the Honda in towing, payload and off-road ability. The Canyon tries to mimic the look of GMC's larger Sierra and largely succeeds, but in the trade, it's harder to reach the bed and cabin.",Inline 4 cylinder ,137," 191 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",, 6-speed shiftable automatic

Some options packages have been revamped for easier ordering and all extended-cab models now come standard with a four-speed automatic transmission, with the manual no longer available. Chevrolet makes a pretty good pick-'em-up if powerful engines are your thing. But it has a ways to go to match the Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra when it comes to the quality of the materials and assembly. Chevrolet's Silverado has a reputation as a fast, comfortable and capable truck. With class-leading engine power and clean looks, Silverado offers innovative features that make it an attractive truck in the competitive world of half-ton pickups. Two cab styles are available in three different trim levels. Regular cabs can be outfitted with Base or LS trim, while extended cabs come in Base, LS or LT. Base Silverados are best used as work trucks, as they come from the factory with a vinyl bench seat, rubber floor covering and few amenties. Mid-grade LS trim is the most popular, with upgrades like cloth upholstery, air conditioning, power windows and locks, cruise control, CD player, remote keyless entry and chrome exterior trim. Fully trimmed LT trucks add aluminum wheels, leather upholstery, the OnStar communications system and premium audio.Several engine choices are available for the Silverado, ranging from a 4.3-liter V6 to a 5.3-liter V8. Most buyers select the mid-range 4800 and 5300 Vortec V8 engines, generating 270 and 285 horsepower respectively. A five-speed manual transmission is standard on regular cabs. Optional on that model (standard on extended and crew cab) is the venerable 4L60-E four-speed automatic, which features a tow-haul mode that improves shifting performance under heavy loads. Holding all this together is a three-section frame that is very stiff and lightweight, giving the big truck a smooth ride and a quiet interior. State-of-the-art steering, suspension and braking systems help make driving the Silverado a joy. Four-wheel disc brakes with ABS are standard, and power rack-and-pinion steering (on models with a GVWR less than 6,400 lbs.) gives the big truck excellent road feel. Electronic traction assist is available on 2WD models for those who don't want the added expense and complexity of four-wheel drive.Unique to the Silverado in the big pickup market is the availability of a PROTEC truck box on extended-cab 4X4s with the Z71 option. A factory alternative to an aftermarket bedliner, this all-composite box is 50 pounds lighter than its steel counterpart. It offers protection from dents and scratches along with superior resistance to corrosion. The tailgate is also lighter for easier opening and closing while its load-carrying capacity increases to 1,000 pounds compared to 600 pounds for the steel version.Inside, Silverado buyers will find a logically laid-out interior, with an easy-to-use climate control system and clear, uncluttered gauges. The cabin is roomy, particularly on extended cab models. Standard rear doors on the extended cab make entry and exit to the rear bench seat easy, and if front passengers are willing to sacrifice a bit of legroom, the back of the extended cab is quite comfortable. Since the front seatbelts are mounted to the seats themselves, rear passengers don't need to chop through a web of straps to get in and out.  With its powerful range of V8 engines, wide lineup of cab and trim levels, and appealing styling, the Silverado should have no problem continuing its successful run in the highly competitive full-size truck market.",V6 cylinder ,137," 260 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 4-speed automatic 
Jeep,jeep wrangler,2000,jeep wrangler 2000,"['Cheap, fun to drive, go-anywhere capability.']","['Interior noise with soft top, difficult to operate soft top.']",4.4,"A reengineered 4.0-liter PowerTech inline six-cylinder that is more refined and quiet, with reduced emissions, is standard for Sport and Sahara for 2000. Shift quality kicks up a notch, thanks to an all-new five-speed manual transmission. A radio/cassette combo with four speakers is now standard for the Sport, and the Sahara gains a radio/CD. Solar Yellow, Patriot Blue and Silverstone are additional exterior colors. It has a stiff ride, offers about the same noise isolation as a motorcycle and has a soft top that's a nail-buster to operate. That said, the 2000 Jeep Wrangler also offers a visceral motoring experience like no other and the off-road ability of a mountain goat. The Wrangler continues to be the off-road icon, even unmodified. The Jeep began as a vehicle for military use and has retained its Spartan utility while slowly evolving into a practical and popular means of transportation. The Wrangler has never lost its drive-me-hard-through-the-slop origins, despite its improvements for enjoyable daily commuting. And it's one of the cheapest convertibles around.Available in SE, Sport and Sahara trim levels, the Wrangler fits into several budgets. Our favorite model is the Sport, with a gutsy 4.0-liter inline six engine that has allegedly been cured this year of one of our chief complaints, its noise. It can be hooked to either the standard five-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission. The SE is for people who don't mind a lack of power (a 2.5-liter is all she wrote at this level) and four-wheel ABS. The Sahara is the priciest of the batch, and while it gets you the same 4.0-liter offering as the Sport, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, front and rear tow hooks, the Convenience Group (with lockable storage and dual cupholders), and the Heavy-Duty Electrical Group are among its as official features.Nobody, however, will mistake the Wrangler for a smooth-running family sedan; it's very much a truck, thanks to its high step-in height and abundant wind and road noise, particularly with the soft top. On the street, its petite size and tight turning radius make it a blast to maneuver, but it can get a little scary to drive and control at freeway speeds in severely high winds. Its performance off-road is unmatchable.  The Wrangler's Quadra-Coil suspension allows an additional 7 inches of articulation over the old leaf-spring setup, thus resulting in increased approach and departure angles. And the abundance of aftermarket parts to modify the Wrangler make it enormously popular with the rock-crawling crowd.The Wrangler does have its quirks--rear visibility can be a challenge, and taking off and putting on the soft top aren't exactly going to be quick. And once it's on, be prepared for the flapping. Yet we're willing to look away from those flaws since Wrangler is fun to drive, cheap, and a terrific multipurpose tool.",Inline 4 cylinder ,385," 140 lb-ft @ 3,500 ",, 5-speed manual

The 2023 GMC Yukon  XL is one of the biggest and most accommodating, an extended version of the  standard Yukon with more third-row seat room, more cargo capacity, and a robust  towing limit of 8,000 pounds. 
 This  year, the Yukon XL adds a new Denali Ultimate trim level that lifts the plush  Denali trim to new heights of decadence. Unique exterior trim, 22-inch wheels and  upgraded leather are only a few of the special touches that push the Denali  Ultimate to a starting price near $100,000. Also contributing to that sum is  the Super Cruise semi-automated driving system, which allows for hands-free  driving. The system works on roads mapped in a cloud-connected database  — typically large divided highways or interstates — and can  even change lanes by itself. The slick system first rolled out in Cadillac  models and is available in 22 other General Motors models for 2023. Super  Cruise comes standard on the Denali Ultimate and is optional for the regular  Denali. 
GMC  positions the Yukon XL as a premium SUV, making it more expensive than its near  twin, the Chevrolet Suburban, but less expensive than the related Cadillac Escalade.  Choosing between the GMC and Chevy comes down to personal preferences because  the two SUVs are nearly identical mechanically. Only the Denali and Denali  Ultimate, with upgraded dash designs and leather, plus Super Cruise, stand  apart from anything the Suburban can offer. The Ford Expedition Max and Jeep  Wagoneer L are also worthy alternatives with higher towing limits than the  Yukon XL. Assuming  you prefer the Yukon XL's extra style and refinement to the equally capable  Chevrolet Suburban's lower price, go with the high-luxe Denali trim. Its powerful V8 engine, bold mesh grille, and  exclusive dashboard design give it a luxury push over its Chevy counterpart or  lower Yukon XL trim levels. The optional Denali Reserve package gets you very  close to the new top-trim Denali Ultimate for thousands less. If fuel economy  is a priority, consider the optional diesel engine.",V8 cylinder ,325," 383 lb-ft @ 4,100 ",, 10-speed shiftable automatic 
Chevrolet,chevrolet tahoe,1999,chevrolet tahoe 1999,['Lots of cargo space.  Powerful V8 engine.  Easy to drive.'],['Unrefined on-road ride.  Mushy brake pedal.  Oddly reclined seatbacks.'],4.3,"The standard cargo net is deleted, and new colors are added as Tahoe enters final model year on this platform. Compact sport-utility vehicles get most of the attention nowadays, but for folks with big families(or scads of goods to lug around) they're just not spacious enough inside.  Chevrolet offers a solution to this problem with the Tahoe, based on the full-size C/K pickup platform but garageable in either two- or four-door body styles.At a glance, the four-door Tahoe and larger Suburban look nearly identical, but a Tahoe measures 20 inches shorter.  Beneath the hood sits a Vortec 5700 V8, rated for 255 horsepower.  Two-door 4WD Tahoes with LS or LT trim can be equipped with a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 instead of the Vortec 5700.From the driver's seat forward, Tahoes are virtually identical to Chevy's full-size C/K pickups.  Space  is massive up front.  Capable of towing as much as 7,000 pounds, four-door Tahoes seat either five or six passengers, and an underbody-mounted spare tire helps boost cargo space.On the Interstate, the Tahoe rides nicely, but the wide body takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to compacts. Turning onto smaller roads, it suddenly feels more like a truck.  Easy to control either way, this sizable machine is reasonably maneuverable, if driven with discretion.  The V8 is strong, and the four-speed automatic transmission shifts neatly.Think about the ""entry assist"" running boards if your regular riders aren't so nimble.  They help.  So  do the robust grab bars that ease entry into the rear seats.  Rear cargo doors are standard, but a lift glass version is available.In 1998, Chevrolet introduced an optional automatic four-wheel drive system that shifts between 2WD and 4WD as conditions warrant.  No longer is it necessary to push a button on the dashboard to actively engage four-wheel traction.  For 1999, the cargo net has been deleted from the standard equipment list, and new colors have been added to the paint chart.  Why has Chevrolet begun producing the 1999 Tahoe already?  Seems there was a little problem with meeting 1998 Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, so by switching to a 1999 model year designation, GM has bought itself a little time to make up for the lousy fuel economy the Tahoe tends to get.Because Chevrolet targets customers with an income of $85,000 a year, luxury conveniences are part of upscale Tahoe packages. The typical prospect is a 40-year-old man who currently drives a Chevy Blazer and is attracted to a vehicle's size and power.  Those attributes the Tahoe has in abundance, as does its little-different GMC Yukon counterpart.With the introduction of the Ford Expedition a few years ago, Chevrolet lost its dominance of the full-size SUV market.  Further complicating matters, the Tahoe is based on a decade-old platform, while the  slightly larger, slightly less expensive Expedition is derived from more modern F-Series underpinnings. The Ford's edge will shrink by 2000, when a completely redesigned Tahoe based on the all-new Chevrolet Silverado pickup debuts.  Buyers might want to wait for a while, because the new truck will be much improved.  However, a 2-door Tahoe will not make the cut for the next millennium, so snap one up now while you have the chance. This single remaining full-size 2-door SUV has a limited future.",V8 cylinder ,215," 330 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 4-speed automatic

An engine immobilizer system has been added to the keyless-entry security system and all Siennas will be equipped with daytime running lights. Selected models have a full-size spare tire and Woodland Pearl replaces Classic Green Pearl as an exterior color option. Toyota's new minivan sits in sharp contrast to the one it replaces. Whereas the Previa was a study in minivan abnormalities, with rear-wheel drive, a midship-mounted supercharged engine, and a shape that looked like the droid escape pod from the first Star Wars movie, the Sienna is a model of suburban respectability.That doesn't, however, mean that this minivan is boring. Resting under the hood is a powerful, 3.0-liter V6 engine that was stolen from the Camry parts bin. The engine isn't the only piece of equipment pilfered from the Camry; the Sienna rides on a stretched and modified Camry platform and uses much of the Camry's interior switchgear. Appropriately referred to internally at Toyota as ""The Camry of minivans,"" we can only assume that the company expects this creation to be as popular as their hot-selling sedan.In order to harness the 194 horses at work under the hood, engineers put antilock brakes at all four wheels of every Sienna. Other safety equipment includes dual airbags, side-impact protection that meets future federal standards and seatbelt pretensioners for both front seats. Last year the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety conducted an offset crash test of the Sienna and called it ""the best performing vehicle in the history of the test.""Interestingly, Toyota was able to talk rivals General Motors and Chrysler into lending a hand on the Sienna's manufacturing process. Not used to making such a large vehicle, Toyota had questions about how to deal with the interior assembly of this van which has well over 130 cubic feet of cargo space.In the end, General Motors and Chrysler may be sorry that they offered to help Toyota figure out some of its manufacturing logistics.

Also available is a front-wheel-drive LX model, and the EX trim level now includes a CD player, antilock brakes and remote keyless entry. For years, Honda has been selling a sport-utility vehicle that many consider a fraud. Forget that the Honda Passport is based on the very rugged and capable Isuzu Rodeo.  To Honda aficionados, it is not a real Honda. (Think of how the Porsche 914 fares in the eyes of diehard Porsche fanatics.) Thus, to many people, the CR-V is the first Honda sport-utility vehicle.Built on the Civic platform, the CR-V successfully integrates familiar Honda components into an all-new design.  Honda's famous four-wheel double-wishbone suspension makes an appearance on the CR-V, the first-ever application of four-wheel double-wishbone technology on a sport-ute, as does the very familiar four-speed automatic transmission. The 2.0-liter DOHC inline four-cylinder engine makes 126 horsepower and 133 foot-pounds of torque. The CR-V's real time four-wheel drive system is a derivative of the unit that Honda initially offered on their Civic wagon. The result of using all of these car components is that the CR-V looks and feels rather like a car.The CR-V's interior is instantly recognizable to anyone who has spent any time in Honda's passenger cars. Functionality takes precedence over style in the CR-V's cabin, and the result is easy-to-read gauges, well-placed controls, and high-quality, if somewhat boring, interior materials. Fit and finish is equal to the highly-acclaimed Accord. The CR-V offers comfortable chairs for its occupants, each of which has excellent visibility and the ability to recline when the trip grows long. The CR-V's cargo capacity is an outstanding 67.2 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded.Available in either LX or EX trim levels for 1998, the CR-V is surprisingly well-equipped even at the LX trim level. Air conditioning with a micron filtration system is standard, as are power windows, power door locks, rear window wiper and defogger, AM/FM stereo, cruise control and a folding picnic table that doubles as a cargo area cover. Options include antilock brakes and alloy wheels (ABS is part of the EX package).The CR-V is not meant to replace hard-core recreational vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler or Toyota 4Runner. Instead, it is meant for the person who wants the functionality of a sport-utility without having to pay an exorbitant sticker price and huge gas bills. The CR-V will get people to work and back in all but  the worst weather, and to their favorite picnic area, assuming it's not on the Rubicon Trail.  Best of all, it's a sport-utility vehicle that Honda lovers can finally call their own.",Inline 4 cylinder ,310," 133 lb-ft @ 4,300 ",, 5-speed manual

Additionally, the 2500 series 3/4-ton van is discontinued. The 2007 GMC Savana (and its twin, the Chevrolet Express) are pretty much the only game in town if you're looking for a traditional full-size van that doesn't look and drive as if it were designed two decades ago. Having been around for more than four decades, GMC's full-size van lived through the '70s, '80s and half of the '90s via sheet metal changes and updates to the running gear. Still, it rode on the same basic platform it had used since the swinging '60s until a complete frame-up redesign took place in 1996. To celebrate the rebirth, the van's name was changed from ""Rally Wagon"" to ""Savana."" A new exterior look, new engines, extended body styles and improved ergonomics soon made the Savana hard to overlook when compared with Ford's dated Econoline. A number of important under-the-skin changes took place for 2003, including a wider selection of V8 engines, the first-time availability of all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements -- all of which went a long way toward making the Savana safer and more capable than ever before.The 2007 GMC Savana still outpaces the aged Econoline and certainly warrants consideration for those who need the immense passenger capacity (up to 15 people can ride in a Savana 3500) and cargo volume only a large van can provide. Naturally, these attributes are most often needed by small businesses and fleet operators. Private individuals seeking a more economical or passenger-friendly alternative might want to consider the Dodge Sprinter. The standard engine on Savana 1500 models is a 5.3-liter V8 making 295 horsepower and 335 pound-feet of torque. A 6.0-liter V8 rated at 300  and 360 lb-ft of torque is standard on 3500s. All 1500 models use a four-speed automatic sending power to the rear wheels, while 3500s get a heavy-duty version of that transmission. An all-wheel-drive configuration is also available for the 1500. The maximum trailer-towing capacity on 1500 models is 6,300 pounds, while the heavy-duty 3500 can pull up to 9,800 pounds when properly equipped. All models have antilock disc brakes standard. The Savana 1500 features a front passenger-sensing system that will deactivate the front airbag if it senses a small adult or child sitting up front, while 3500 models use a manual airbag deactivation switch for the front passenger. A stability-control system is standard on the 3500 but not available on the 1500. In frontal-impact crash tests conducted by the NHTSA, the 2007 GMC Savana scored five stars (the highest possible). A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2007 GMC Savana a leg up on Ford's Econoline when it comes to ride and handling. Although GMC's van is still far from nimble, it's a better choice for day-to-day driving. And with a pair of V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers come easily, even when you're hauling a heavy load of passengers and cargo. The GMC's interior is built for pure functionality, and while it may not be pretty, it gets the job done. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but the footwells remain as cramped as ever. Savana buyers can opt for 60/40-split driver-side doors for easier passenger access to the rear seats. The standard configuration seats 12, with 8- or 15-passenger arrangements also available, depending on which model you choose. The standard-wheelbase (135-inch) GMC Savana full-size van comes in half-ton (1500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations. The extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available only on the 3500. There are two trim levels: LS and LT. LS models are geared toward fleet service so standard equipment is limited to air-conditioning, an AM/FM stereo and a theft-deterrent system. The more livable LT models include auxiliary rear air-conditioning and heating, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and keyless entry. Optional equipment includes power driver and front-passenger seats, alloy wheels and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer.",V8 cylinder ,138," 335 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 4-speed automatic

More capable than the F-150 and  F-250 Super Duty, the F-350 is available with six trim levels, three cab styles  and two cargo bed lengths. You can also choose between two gasoline V8 engines  and a turbodiesel V8 and add four-wheel drive and a dual-rear-wheel axle if  that's what you need. Spec the truck to your requirements and the F-350 will be  ready for just about any task or adventure you're planning. 
People often buy the F-350 for its towing  and hauling capabilities. When properly equipped, this heavy-duty full-size  pickup supplies a maximum conventional towing capacity of 21,200 pounds. If you  set the F-350 up for fifth-wheel towing, it can handle a trailer weighing up to  35,750 pounds. Either way, these ratings make the F-350 compatible with most  big recreational and commercial-oriented trailers. If hauling is what you need,  the F-350 can carry a maximum payload of 7,850 pounds in its cargo bed,  depending on the configuration.
To make the F-350 appealing to the  largest number of customers possible, Ford makes it available in a range of  models spanning from a basic work truck to a plush and technologically advanced  luxury model. If you spend lots of time off-road, consider the F-350's Tremor  package for its added capability when the going gets tough. Ford even offers an  integrated winch for the Tremor that supplies 12,000 pounds of capacity.
This year, Ford makes a few changes to  further improve the F-350's appeal. The King Ranch and Platinum trims join the  Limited in offering standard four-wheel drive and 20-inch wheels, and all but  the two most affordable versions of the truck get a new 12-inch touchscreen  display that's an upgrade over the base 4.2- or 8-inch screen. Ford also offers  the F-350 XLT and Lariat with new appearance packages.
While change is inevitable, these things  about the Ford F-350 remain the same. This rig works hard, plays hard, and  looks good doing it. Choosing  just one version of the F-350 to recommend is hard, but we think the Lariat trim offers the best blend of  price, configurations, equipment, and access to upgrades in the F-350 lineup.  Additionally, the Lariat is available with the Tremor off-road package and this  year's two new appearance packages.

That's more than the  weight of two fully grown African bull elephants, by the way. The Silverado  3500HD comes second to only the Ram 3500 when it comes to maximum towing, and  only to the tune of 1,100 pounds.

Once a step behind the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra  and Kia Forte (Edmunds' top-ranked small sedans), the Jetta is a more viable  alternative after its recent updates. 
Those  changes included new styling, more standard features, improved technology, and  a new turbocharged engine that should give the Jetta more pep. The Jetta's 1.5-liter  turbocharged inline-four makes 158 horsepower, an improvement of 11  over the  outgoing model and one likely to help it feel less ponderous. But if you want  more power, the Jetta GLI (which we cover separately) offers GTI-like  performance in a sedan package. 
Volkswagen's  minimalist aesthetic stands in sharp contrast to the angular Elantra and Forte,  and the Jetta goes about its business with less seriousness than the Civic. We  feared the Jetta might go the route of other Volkswagen models and overdo the  touch controls on the center stack and steering wheel for most of the car's  functions, but instead it goes for the simpler (and better) solution with dials  and buttons for the climate and volume/tuning knobs for its screen. If only the  GTI and ID.4 could go back in time a little as well.
With  an emphasis on style and value, including a long list of standard features and  two years/20,000 miles of standard maintenance, the Jetta now sits as the  contrarian pick to the mainstream compact sedans, and its roomy back seat makes  it a better choice for those who will be carrying more than two people on the  regular. See below for more information on the Jetta's trim levels and how it  stacks up against competitors. The  Jetta is well equipped even as a base model, but we recommend the midlevel SE trim. It includes all of the Jetta's  available safety technology as standard, plus modern amenities such as keyless  entry, heated seats, simulated leather and rain-sensing wipers for not much  more than the base price. The SEL's technology upgrades are tempting  (especially wireless connectivity for both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay), but  the price premium is too steep.",Inline 4 cylinder ,200," 184 lb-ft @ 1,750 ",, 6-speed manual

The Z51 performance-handling package has larger front and rear stabilizer bars for improved handling, while new thin-spoke alloy wheels with optional high-polish finish subtly change the outward appearance. Two new colors are available on coupe and convertible: extra-cost Millennium Yellow and no-cost Dark Bowling Green Metallic. A Torch Red interior can be ordered, the stupendous LS1 5.7-liter V8 engine meets LEV regulations in California, the remote keyless-entry system has been upgraded, and the passenger door-lock cylinder has been deleted. Stunning performance for less than $50,000. Need we say more? If bang-for-the-buck is your priority, look no further. More than 40 years after the 1953 Corvette debuted, Chevrolet introduced the fifth-generation Corvette for 1997. With the addition of a hardtop model to the lineup in 1999, three different Corvettes are available for 2000.Pushrod power -- in the form of a 5.7-liter LS1 LEV-compliant V8 -- motivates the Corvette. Horsepower is rated 345 at 5,600 rpm, while torque measures 350 foot-pounds at 4,400 rpm. Equipped with the standard four-speed automatic transmission, the Corvette will hit 60 mph in a shade over five seconds. Opt for the six-speed manual transmission and you'll cut less than half a second off the trap time. To help reign the power in on slippery surfaces, acceleration slip regulation (a.k.a., traction control) is standard equipment.Monstrous four-wheel-disc antilock brakes keep stopping distances short, while massive 17-inch front and 18-inch rear tires contribute to prodigious amounts of road grip. The rubber stays planted well, too, thanks to a fully independent four-wheel SLA height-adjustable suspension. Optional on coupe and convertible is an Active Handling System (AHS), which keeps the Corvette in line even if the driver isn't.Body panels are still composed of a material other than metal, though no longer fiberglass.  Sheet-molded compound wraps around an ultra-stiff structure that features a full-length perimeter frame with tubular steel side rails. A sandwich composite floor with a lightweight balsa wood core damps noise and vibration while making the floor exceptionally stiff.Inside, a dash with analog gauges and intuitive radio and climate controls greets passengers. Luggage space beneath the coupe's rear hatch glass is an incredible 25 cubic feet. Even the hardtop and convertible can tote more cargo than any Corvette in history.To celebrate the turn of the century, buyers of the coupe and convertible can pay extra for Millennium Yellow bodywork. Or you can set yourself apart from the crowd with no-extra-cost Dark Bowling Green Metallic, named after the Kentucky city where the Corvette is assembled.  A new interior color, Torch Red, debuts as well.  New wheels with thinner spokes can be ordered with a silver or high polish finish - the optional magnesium wheels are still available.  Other changes include a revised remote keyless-entry system and thicker stabilizer bars for models equipped with the Z51 performance and handling package.Yes, the Corvette is an outstanding effort and competes favorably with the best in the class. Long, low, and lean, the Corvette is certainly attractive. We take issue, however, with the thick truncated tail and the odd-looking air scoops for the front brakes. Still, the Corvette's new shape will wear well into the next century.Don't let the fact that the C5 will swallow two golf bags sway you into thinking this a gentrified sporting coupe.

Buy the Value Package. To get remote keyless entry or a power driver seat on the LE, you must buy a Value Package. A power moonroof and an in-dash six-disc CD changer require the Leather Value Package on XLE models. LE V6 models get daytime running lights standard, while JBL audio is optional on all LEs. The anti-theft system with engine immobilizer is restricted to XLE V6 models. Comfort and a reputation for reliability make the 2001 Toyota Camry an American favorite. A home appliance on wheels. The Toyota Camry is one of America's most-favored mid-size sedans. The reasons are simple. It boasts room for five adults, can be ordered with a powerful and smooth-revving V6, and comes with the reputation of solid Toyota reliability. But can you believe the recent ""I'm Too Sexy"" advertising campaign?  Featuring the lead singer from one-hit-wonder band Right Said Fred, the TV ads proclaim that the Camry is too sexy for a number of things, including drive-thrus, car washes and dry cleaning pick-up runs.  So, uh, what are you supposed to use the innocuously styled sedan for?  Picking up hot dates?  Running Laguna Seca?  Impressing the Joneses?Camry can be equipped for everything from rugged family life or plush luxury touring, but nothing particularly sexy.  Club hopping and canyon carving are not on the menu, though Toyota Racing Development (TRD - how sexy is that acronym?  Further evidence supporting our case for truthfulness in advertising.) will sell you a kit that turns this grocery-getter into a competent handler.  There are three different trims: base-level CE, mid-level LE, and the top-level XLE.  LE and XLE can be equipped with a delicious 3.0-liter V6 engine, which produces 200 horsepower and 214 foot-pounds of torque.  Acceleration is impressive, and unlike six-pot Honda Accords and Mitsubishi Galants, the Camry LE V6 can be ordered with a manual transmission.  Pop the TuRD components on, and you've got a hell of a sleeper.  Braking is swift and sure with the antilock system, and Camry hangs on well in corners despite rather meek all-season radials and substantial body roll.  This car is tuned for a soft, quiet ride out of the factory. Inside, controls and gauges are laid-out nicely in a dated but ergonomically correct dashboard.  The switches and stalks all exhibit a solid heft, imparting a sense of quality.  Abundant storage areas include a deep center console, door bins, and dashboard bins.  Front cupholders accommodate 20-ounce bottles of your favorite beverage.  The only downside to this cabin is that you might find the seats uncomfortable. Notable options include side airbags, traction control, a JBL sound system, leather interior trim, and a power moonroof.  ABS is standard on LE and XLE models equipped with a V6 engine.For 2001, Toyota has juggled value package content and stand-alone option availability.  Want air conditioning and power windows/locks/mirrors on the CE?  How about remote keyless entry or a power driver's seat on the LE?  Don't forget a power moonroof and six-disc in-dash CD changer on an XLE.  All require the purchase of a Value Package.  A JBL audio system is newly optional on all LEs, this year, and an anti-theft system with engine immobilizer is restricted to XLE V6 models.  Overall, Camry works well as a family sedan.

Acura,acura integra,1999,acura integra 1999,['Great performance at an affordable price.'],"['Cramped rear seat, dated appearance.']",4.9,"In a small step upmarket, Acura has decided to kill the Integra's entry-level RS trim. The LS gets leather accents and 15-inch wheels, and the sporty GS-R now comes with leather seats. Type-R will return in limited numbers later in the year. Honda enjoys the distinction of landing luxury cars in the United States before any other Japanese automaker had even considered the idea.  The Legend sedan, marketed under the Acura nameplate, was aninteresting choice over domestic luxury sedans, and was an inexpensive and reliable alternative to European luxury marques.  However, Honda couldn't expect to sell enough Legends to keep its new Acura franchise afloat, so engineers spruced up the Honda Civic platform and introduced the nimble Integra to complement the bigger sedan in showrooms.Since 1986, when the Integra debuted, it has garnered praise from a variety of automotive and consumer groups.  Integras have always been sporty, practical, fun-to-drive and reliable.  They are popular cars with a wide demographic group. The current iteration, which is the third generation of the Integra, is no exception to this rule.While imminently comfortable for two and even livable for four full-sized adults, the Integra is first and foremost a driver's car.  Think of it as a Japanese BMW 3-series and you won't be far off.  Sure it's got fewer cylinders and the wrong set of wheels pulling it around, but if you can't afford the price of entry (or maintenance or insurance) for anything from Bavaria, the Integra makes an adequate substitute.  With a fully independent four-wheel double wishbone suspension, front and rear stabilizer bars, and a thick steering wheel that gives excellent feedback about what's going on down below, the Integra is one of the best-handling front-drivers in the world.If competent handling was all the Integra had to offer, it would still be worth considering, even in today's competitive sport compact market.  Fortunately, Acura didn't stop there.  The base engine, sold on GS and LS trim, is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder unit that makes an adequate 140 horsepower.  Step up to the GS-R and you're rewarded with a VTEC-enhanced 1.8-liter inline four that boasts 170 horsepower and 128 foot-pounds of torque.But wait, there's more: The Type R was added to Integra's stable late in the summer of 1997, quickly becoming the standard by which all sport coupes are measured.  Offering 195 horsepower at 8,000 rpm, hand-polished intake and exhaust ports and a high-flow exhaust system all make for a fire-breathing engine.  Did we mention the 8500 redline?  Type ""R"" is for rrrrrev.The Integra sport coupes and sedans are quick and comfortable, with excellent build quality.  Since 1994, they've sported swoopy, modern styling, featuring quad, circular headlamps.  Seating, headroom, and overall ergonomics are typical Honda: straightforward and functional. The shifter is one of the best in the industry with a shape that fits the hand perfectly and has a relatively short throw between gears.Ultimately, however, time and the automotive world wait for no car and the Integra's appearance is showing its age.

A bland but otherwise utterly capable and perfectly useful SUV. Acura may be late to the SUV party, but they've decided to come dressed to the nines with a uniquely transformable interior wrapped in an angularly attractive skin supported by a four-wheel independent suspension and 17-inch alloy wheels. With its standard 240-horsepower, 3.5-liter VTEC V6 (which meets ULEV regulations nationwide) and electronically controlled five-speed automatic transmission, the MDX delivers better performance than many of its competitors. With an estimated EPA rating of 17 city and 23 highway, the MDX is also one of the most fuel-efficient SUVs in its class. Power travels to the wheels through Acura's new Variable Torque Management (VTM) full-time four-wheel-drive system, which uses sensors to determine the vehicle's dynamic position and transfers engine torque to the wheels with the most grip. Unlike conventional automatic 4WD systems, Acura's proactively distributes engine torque during acceleration before wheel slip occurs. Unlike a Mercedes ML320, the MDX doesn't have a 4WD-low gear range and the towing capacity is low (at 3,500 pounds) for its class.In terms of appearance, MDX includes Acura's signature pentagon grille, clean headlamp treatment and sharply chiseled front fascia, but with a muscular look appropriate to an SUV. Some of us find the bulky nose a bit off-putting, but from most viewpoints, the MDX is quite a looker. We like to think of it as a luxury off-road minivan that you can take through the brush all day, and the valet will still front-line it for you when you reach Spago for lunch.Inside, the MDX features second- and third-row seats that split and fold flat into the floor, creating an interior that can be easily reconfigured from seven-passenger hauler (though we wouldn't recommend adults trying to cram in the third row) to a flat-floor Home Depot runner in a matter of seconds. Large, flowing shapes dominate the instrument panel and center console, which is highlighted by wood-grained trim. The MDX comes with a comprehensive list of standard equipment, including leather seating surfaces (on first- and second-row seating), eight-way power and heated front seats, side airbags for front passengers, keyless entry, power moonroof, automatic climate control and a multi-function digital trip computer. Opt for the Touring Package and the front seat positions become linked to the key fob remotes, plus you get a 200-watt Acura/Bose stereo with in-dash six-disc CD changer as well as a handy roof rack. An optional DVD navigation system, mapped for all the 48 contiguous states, is also available.Sure, Acura may be a latecomer to the SUV party, but this is by far the most agreeable urban runabout to ever hit this segment.

If the Express offers the package you need in a full-size van, then buy it. When Chevy dealers received a brand-new, full-size van to sell in 1996, it marked the first time in 25 years that GM had completely redesigned its big vans. The Chevy Express comes equipped with a cavernous interior and a variety of powerful engines. With its modern design and body-on-frame construction, Chevrolet is stealing some of Ford's thunder in the full-size van market.Because most full-size vans are bought for conversion into rolling motel rooms, engineers put the Chevy Express on a full-frame platform for improved stability. Regular-length models carry 267 cubic feet of cargo, and extended-length vans can haul 317 cubic feet of stuff. Trick rear doors open 180 degrees to make loading and unloading easier.  Standard side cargo doors are a 60/40 panel arrangement, but a traditional slider is a no-cost option on 135-inch wheelbase vans.  G3500s can tow up to 10,000 pounds when properly equipped.  For convenience, the full-size spare is stored underneath the cargo floor. A 31-gallon fuel tank keeps this thirsty vehicle from frequent fill-ups, but topping off an empty tank will quickly empty your wallet.  An 8.1-liter V8 replaces last year's 7.4-liter engine providing a class-leading 340 horsepower and 455 ft-lbs. of torque.  Other powerplants include the 4300 V6, 5000 and 5700 gas V8s, and a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8. Exterior styling is an interesting mix of corporate Chevrolet, Astro Van and old Lumina minivan. We'll admit the high, rear pillar-mounted taillights are odd looking, but at least they're functional.  They can easily be seen even if the van is operated with the rear doors open. Low-mounted bumpers and moldings make the Chevy Express look much taller than it is. An attractively sculpted body side gives the van's smooth, slab-sided flanks a dose of character, as does the quad-lamp grille arrangement.

Even though the S4 is due for a redesign next year, we recommend this car to driving enthusiasts without hesitation. Although not cheap by any means, the S4 Sedan and Avant Wagon offer a mouth-watering array of features and improvements over the previous-generation A4 after which they are modeled.Starting things out is a 2.7-liter twin-turbo V6 engine. Sporting twin intercoolers, dual-overhead cams, five valves per cylinder, variable valve timing for the intake camshaft and optimized combustion chambers, the engine generates 250 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. Audi has designed the engine to provide much of its power low in the rev band. Consequently, the S4 makes quick work of freeway on-ramps and passing maneuvers. Audi gives buyers of the S4 a choice of transmissions: There's a six-speed manual transmission or a five-speed Tiptronic automanual.All S4s come with Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system, which constantly monitors the grip of the tires. When one of them starts to lose traction, the quattro system automatically applies power to the tires with the most adhesion. Audi says this latest edition of the quattro all-wheel-drive system is capable of allowing the car to get underway even when only one wheel has reasonable traction. The suspension and braking components of the S4 are well tuned. Major items of note are stiffer shocks and springs and unique 17-inch wheels with 225/45R17 tires. An Electronic Stabilization Program (ESP) is standard equipment.The interior features attractive design and an adequate number of goodies. Special leather upholstery covers standard power seats, and contrasting color suede inserts can be had when ordering the Sport Interior package. Other options to consider include a sunroof, heated front seats, a six-disc CD changer and a Bose premium audio system. For safety, there are standard front and head protection airbags.The S4 Avant includes such niceties as a retractable luggage cover, retractable dividing cargo net and aluminum-finish roof rails that beckon to SUV-weary drivers. It's perfect for anyone who needs utility but refuses to give up stellar sport-sedan performance.Outside, the S4 exhibits subtle differences from 2001 A4s (which many of us prefer to the newer A4s). The aforementioned 17-inch wheels, a larger front air-intake opening and S4 badging are the only clues that this is the high-performance variantThe S4 driving experience is a pleasure.

Dual power-sliding doors are optional, and the safety-conscious will like the fact that side airbags and a stability control system are available. Sienna's smooth V6 makes more power and torque this year. A rear defroster is standard on all Siennas, while JBL audio, heated front seats and an electrochromic rearview mirror with integrated compass are optional on XLE models. Styling has been tweaked front and rear, four new colors replace four old colors and all Siennas come with a driver-side sliding door. No more exciting than a toaster, but comes close to being the perfect minivan appliance. Despite the fact that it's four model years old and doesn't offer as much utility and functionality as newer competitors, the Toyota Sienna is one of the top choices in the minivan class. With the Sienna, Toyota has placed an emphasis on safety, quality, and performance.There are three models: the base CE, the mid-level LE, and the top-level XLE. All come standard with five doors for 2001. Under the hood is a smooth, powerful, and refined 3.0-liter V6 mated to a four-speed automatic transmission that drives the front wheels. This same powertrain setup can also be found in the Toyota Camry, fitting since the Sienna is built on a stretched and modified Camry platform. In the Sienna, the engine produces 210 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque, both figures up from last year thanks to the addition of variable valve timing technology.Sienna's rigid and lightweight unitized body performed exceptionally well in government crash tests. For 2001, Sienna's safety record is enhanced by newly optional side airbags and an available stability control system. Other standard safety features include ABS, front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters, front height-adjustable seatbelt anchors, and daytime running lights. Every Sienna is also equipped with a low tire-pressure warning system.The Sienna driving experience is similar to the Camry in that it's pleasantly non-confrontational. Steering is sure, if not quite nimble. The suspension does a good job of soaking up road imperfections, and wind noise is kept to a minimum. Braking is exceptionally competent. Acceleration from the V6 is acceptable for almost all situations, and the cabin is quiet at highway speeds.Sienna was designed to offer optimum interior roominess in a compact, easy-to-maneuver package. The interior has a definite Camry feel to it, constructed and trimmed in high-quality materials. Removable modular seating allows for custom configurations to accommodate a variety of cargo requirements. A second-row bench seat or captain's chairs and third-row seats can be folded or removed to accommodate bulkier cargo. Third-row seats also add a 50/50 split-folding and tumble feature for additional cargo space, but can't match many competitors for overall user-friendliness. Dual power-operated sliding side doors are optional this year.What Sienna needs to remain competitive in the class is a third-row seat that tumbles into the floor like newer models from Honda and Mazda. More comfortable front seats would help, too, as the current chairs are firm yet unsupportive, and don't offer a wide enough range of adjustment.Overall, Toyota does not make the biggest or most useful minivan, but it does make a reliable, safe, good-performing and refined alternative to a number of family haulers on the market.",V6 cylinder ,189," 220 lb-ft @ 4,400 ",, 4-speed automatic

A wise move, since loyal Subaru buyers stick with the brand, partially because of the wide variety of AWD models in the company's stable.  In the early '90s, the company attempted to steal market share from Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Mazda with bread-and-butter front-wheel drive models.  The two-wheelers failed dismally.These days, Subaru is enjoying rising success in the United States, in part due to consumer awareness of the safety benefits of all-wheel drive vehicles, and in part because of the popularity of the sport-utility vehicle.  In 1996, Subaru introduced a jacked-up, duded-out edition of the hot-selling Legacy Station wagon.  Called the Outback, it was sold as the world's first sport-utility wagon.  Evidently, Subaru marketing gurus, like much of the buying public, have forgotten the AMC Eagle Sportswagon of the early '80s.If it ain't broke, don't fix it, goes the old adage.  Subaru is taking this advice.  Gone is the slow-selling LSi luxury model, leaving Brighton wagon, L sedan and wagon, 2.5GT sedan and wagon, and Outback wagons.  A new 2.5GT Limited sedan has been added, and it comes with leather upholstery, CD player, dark tinted glass, upgraded sound insulation and a Weatherband radio.  The 2.5GT Limited comes only with an automatic, unfortunately.  In January, Paul Hogan introduced the 1999 Sport-Utility Sedan (an Outback four-door by any other name).  Mix Outback styling cues with a sedan body style and you get the picture.  An interesting vehicle to be sure, but where's the utility portion of the equation?Overall, prices haven't changed much, but some equipment has been deleted from the Brighton and L models to keep pricing in line.  Base Outback wagons get new six-spoke alloy wheels and longer splash guards, along with a Weatherband radio.  Previously, the latter was only available on the Outback Limited, which can be equipped with a power dual sunroof for 1998.  All Outback Limited models became 30th Anniversary Editions midyear with the addition of revised exterior trim and standard dual illuminated visor vanity mirrors, intermittent windshield wipers, front seatback netting and front door courtesy lights.Two engines are available.  Brighton and L models have a 2.2-liter, 137-horsepower boxer under the hood.  Step up to the 2.5GT or the Outback and you'll enjoy a 165-horsepower 2.5-liter flat four that provides entertaining acceleration around town, particularly with the manual transmission.Bargains can be had in the Legacy lineup.  The L model comes equipped with cruise control, tachometer, power door locks, and four-wheel disc brakes with ABS.  The real deal is the Brighton wagon.  With all-wheel drive, a 40-watt sound system and air conditioning all standard, this model is priced much lower than most other two-wheel drive wagons on the market.  Add some alloy wheels, and nobody will know it's the cheapest Legacy in the lineup.  Unfortunately, ABS is not available on the Brighton.Subaru has a good thing going with the Legacy, which offers a little something for everyone.  Roomy, comfortable and loaded with utility, the Legacy's standard all-wheel drive should make you think twice about that Taurus, RAV4 or CR-V.",Flat 4 cylinder ,135," 145 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual

ABS is available as a stand-alone option on the GLS, and Steel Gray joins the color chart.  Upgraded seat fabric comes in the base and GL models, while all Sonatas get CFC-free A/C. Sonata is Hyundai's midsize entry, and faces some very stiff competition in this category.  Ford's new Contour/Mystique populates this class of automobiles, as does the new Cirrus/Stratus duo from Chrysler, and perennial favorites such as the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Mazda 626.  Heady competition indeed.Hyundai's forte to date has been budget prices and standard (or low priced) luxuries that couldn't be matched by competitors.  It seems those days are over.  The Sonata GLS we sampled ran nearly $21,500.  True, it was well loaded with automatic, sunroof, leather and power everything, but a similarly equipped Contour SE or Chrysler Cirrus is priced less than the Sonata.  Considering Hyundai's quality record, we don't find the GLS to be a viable option in this class, particularly since the Contour/Mystique twins are a real kick in the pants to drive.That's not to say that the Sonata isn't a satisfying car.  The doors thunk shut nicely, it is quiet and comfortable inside, and the leather makes it feel like a much more expensive sedan.  Everything looks and functions as though quality has been built-in, but the radio and climate controls are a tad overdone.  The back seat could benefit from better thigh and back support, but it isn't any more uncomfortable that the rear quarters of a Dodge Stratus.  Overall, we are impressed with this roomy effort from Hyundai.Unfortunately, the Sonata competes with many cars that feel as good and often cost less money.  Factor in the depreciation that the Hyundai is sure to endure, as well as the questionable quality levels of past Sonatas, and this new one's shine begins to dull.  At $18,500, the leather-lined Sonata GLS would begin to look like a bargain, but $21,500 is better spent on something else.",Inline 4 cylinder ,170," 129 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual

More capable than the F-150 and  F-250 Super Duty, the F-350 is available with six trim levels, three cab styles  and two cargo bed lengths. You can also choose between two gasoline V8 engines  and a turbodiesel V8 and add four-wheel drive and a dual-rear-wheel axle if  that's what you need. Spec the truck to your requirements and the F-350 will be  ready for just about any task or adventure you're planning. 
People often buy the F-350 for its towing  and hauling capabilities. When properly equipped, this heavy-duty full-size  pickup supplies a maximum conventional towing capacity of 21,200 pounds. If you  set the F-350 up for fifth-wheel towing, it can handle a trailer weighing up to  35,750 pounds. Either way, these ratings make the F-350 compatible with most  big recreational and commercial-oriented trailers. If hauling is what you need,  the F-350 can carry a maximum payload of 7,850 pounds in its cargo bed,  depending on the configuration.
To make the F-350 appealing to the  largest number of customers possible, Ford makes it available in a range of  models spanning from a basic work truck to a plush and technologically advanced  luxury model. If you spend lots of time off-road, consider the F-350's Tremor  package for its added capability when the going gets tough. Ford even offers an  integrated winch for the Tremor that supplies 12,000 pounds of capacity.
This year, Ford makes a few changes to  further improve the F-350's appeal. The King Ranch and Platinum trims join the  Limited in offering standard four-wheel drive and 20-inch wheels, and all but  the two most affordable versions of the truck get a new 12-inch touchscreen  display that's an upgrade over the base 4.2- or 8-inch screen. Ford also offers  the F-350 XLT and Lariat with new appearance packages.
While change is inevitable, these things  about the Ford F-350 remain the same. This rig works hard, plays hard, and  looks good doing it. Choosing  just one version of the F-350 to recommend is hard, but we think the Lariat trim offers the best blend of  price, configurations, equipment, and access to upgrades in the F-350 lineup.  Additionally, the Lariat is available with the Tremor off-road package and this  year's two new appearance packages. It is the best all-arounder in the lineup.",V8 cylinder ,140," 430 lb-ft @ 3,800 ",, 10-speed shiftable automatic 
Infiniti,infiniti qx50,2016,infiniti qx50 2016,"['Powerful V6 engine', 'responsive handling', 'low base price.']","['Limited cargo room', 'all-or-nothing options packages', 'dated interior that lacks some desirable features', 'subpar fuel economy.']",4.5,"The  2016 Infiniti QX50 returns in a single trim level with a newly stretched  wheelbase that creates substantially more rear legroom. The exterior styling  has also been revised, while additional standard features include LED daytime  running lights, a sunroof and heated seats. The Premium Plus package is new  this year.  With the 2016 Infiniti QX50's growth spurt, our criticism of its cramped backseat has been addressed. There are still better choices than this aging crossover, but it's a decent value. Words  often have multiple meanings, and so it is with the ""new"" 2016  Infiniti QX50. On the one hand, Infiniti has given its compact luxury crossover  a newly stretched wheelbase. The rear seat is the primary beneficiary, as it  gains a useful 4.3 inches of legroom, putting the QX50 on equal footing with  its competitors. This ""Q"" also rides more smoothly than before, as  vehicles with longer wheelbases feel more stately on the highway.
Otherwise,  the QX50 is largely unchanged from last year, which is a good and bad thing. The  good part is that the QX50 remains one of the more engaging small luxury  crossovers to drive, what with its 325-horsepower V6 and sporty underpinnings  that are distantly related to the Nissan 370Z sports car. The bad part is that it  hasn't received a full redesign since it debuted as the EX35 back in 2008. From its  relatively poor fuel economy and dated 7-inch infotainment display to its lack  of expected features like a power liftgate and standard Bluetooth audio (it's  optional), the QX50 is showing its age. We're not enamored of its humble  18-cubic-foot cargo capacity, either -- even the compact Volkswagen  Golf hatchback can swallow more stuff.

Even  with the stretched wheelbase this year, the 2016 Infiniti QX50 remains an  attractive crossover, inside and out.
While  the QX50 has gotten a new lease on life, there are several other luxury  crossover models that are worth a close look. The Acura RDX can't match the  Infiniti's sharp handling, but it offers more cargo space and a significantly  less thirsty V6. The BMW X3 will probably cost you more, but it's also better at just about everything.  Same goes for the Audi Q5,  which is nearly as old as the Infiniti but has managed to age more gracefully. In  the final measure, the 2016 Infiniti QX50 may end up seeming a bit too familiar  apart from its ""new"" dimensions, but it might still merit  consideration if the price is right. Under  the hood, the 2016 Infiniti QX50 gets a 3.7-liter V6 engine that produces 325  horsepower and 267 pound-feet of torque. Power is put to the pavement via a  seven-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel drive is standard, while all-wheel  drive is available as an option.
The  big V6 posts disappointing EPA fuel economy ratings of 20 mpg combined (17 city/25 highway) with rear-wheel drive and 20 mpg  combined (17/24) with all-wheel drive. The  2016 Infiniti QX50 is equipped with antilock disc brakes, traction and  stability control, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and active front  head restraints.
The  optional Technology package adds forward-collision warning and mitigation  through automatic engagement of the brakes. Also included are blind-spot  monitoring, lane-departure warning and lane-departure prevention. The  2016 Infiniti QX50 has a pleasantly supple ride, but its performance-tinged  roots are also apparent. The chassis is taut and complemented by precise,  responsive steering that has a nice heft to it, while the transmission blips  the throttle like a racecar driver on manual downshifts. As for the naturally  aspirated 325- V6, it's got plenty of sauce at higher rpm, but it lacks the  urgent shove off the line that turbocharged engines provide. Furthermore, you  can feel the V6 vibrating through the steering wheel during hard acceleration, which  is an unusual and undesirable experience for a luxury-branded vehicle. The  cabin of the 2016 Infiniti QX50 has an upscale feel throughout. Materials  quality is generally good, with standard leather upholstery accented by  available maple trim. The overall design has begun to look rather dated  compared to more modern crossovers, however. That impression is backed up by the  relatively small 7-inch central display screen and the lack of standard  Bluetooth streaming audio, though we do like the bird's-eye view in tight  spaces provided by the optional Around  View monitor. 
The  QX50's front seats are adequately comfortable on long trips, though the  steering wheel could stand to telescope out another inch or two for long-legged  drivers. The rear compartment's 4.3 inches of additional legroom for 2016 don't  exactly turn this crossover into a limousine, but the result is appreciably  more spacious seating that can accommodate even taller adults without issue. The  rear seat cushion is notable for its generous height, enhancing under-thigh  support and giving rear passengers a nice view of the scenery.

The biggest  gains for the 2016 QX50 are in the backseat, where occupants will enjoy a  4.3-inch increase in legroom.
When  it comes to hauling things rather than people, the QX50 offers 18.6 cubic feet of  space behind the rear seats, which is about as stingy as it gets in this  segment. Fold those seatbacks down -- at the touch of a button, on models so equipped  -- and you have a nearly flat load floor with 50.1 cubic feet of cargo room,  slightly more than the outgoing model. The lack of a power liftgate is a rare shortcoming  for a vehicle in this class. 
Standard  equipment includes 18-inch alloy wheels, automatic halogen headlights, heated  power-folding outside mirrors, a sunroof, keyless entry and ignition, dual-zone  automatic climate control, leather upholstery, an eight-way power driver seat,  a four-way power front passenger seat, heated front seats, 60/40-split folding  rear seatbacks, cruise control, a trip computer, a rearview camera, Bluetooth  phone connectivity and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player, satellite  radio preparation, a USB port and auxiliary audio/video input jacks.
Options,  most of which are grouped into packages, include the Premium package, which  bundles aluminum roof rails, an advanced climate control system, a power-adjustable  steering wheel, driver memory settings, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, genuine  maple interior trim and an 11-speaker Bose audio system.
The  Premium Plus package includes front and rear parking sensors, a touchscreen  navigation system, voice controls, Bluetooth streaming audio and a 360-degree  camera system (Infiniti's ""Around View Monitor"").
The  Deluxe Touring package adds 19-inch alloy wheels, adaptive xenon headlights,  driver power lumbar, an eight-way power front passenger seat, upgraded  dashboard trim, power-folding  second-row seats and a built-in coat hanger on the back of the driver seat.
Finally,  the Technology package includes adaptive  cruise control, forward collision warning, blind spot warning, lane  departure warning and lane departure intervention.

The  QX50's cabin is well-appointed, but the technology interface is outdated  compared to systems like BMW's iDrive and Audi's MMI.",V6 cylinder ,401," 267 lb-ft @ 5,200 ",, 7-speed shiftable automatic

New 17-inch aluminum wheels are optional on the GT. The Passive Anti-Theft System has been introduced to all 1997 Ford Mustangs. The Ford Mustang has been around for 33 years now.  After receiving a dramatic redesign in 1994, and the 4.6-liter modular V8 in 1996, the Mustang design team has been given a rest for 1997.  Changes to this year's model are strictly cosmetic. That's OK, Ford's pony car has been outselling the competition from GM by nearly a 2-1 margin since its redesign.We think that it's a good idea for Ford to take a year off from messing with things on their little hot-rod.  With all of the other changes taking place with the rest of their models, some of which haven't been well received, it seems like a good idea to follow the ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" rule.  Of course, there are some things that we would like to see happen with the Mustang.  First, it would be nice if the Base and GT models gained a few horsepower to make them more competitive with the GM pony cars.  Second, we would like see traction control made available on the GTs and Cobras.  Sure, they have Traction-Lok axles, but it is pretty darn easy to get the back end of the car pointed in the wrong direction.  We think that a brake/engine speed traction control system would make this car much friendlier in wet weather conditions.Speaking of friendly, we love the Mustang's interior, and think that it is the main reason that the Stang sells more models than Camaro and Firebird combined.  The seats sit fairly high, giving drivers an outstanding view of the road; the dashboard has a nice two-toned, double bubble layout that is nicely textured; the gauges and controls are easy to view and manipulate; and the front bucket seats offer great lateral support.  We won't dwell too much on the back seat, because no one in their right mind buys a sports car for rear seat room.As you have undoubtedly read, the Mustang is a very driver-friendly car, very easy to navigate around town, and pretty forgiving on the freeways.  We like its lively tail, but it can be disconcerting when traveling on twisty two-laners.  If you are looking for a car to go canyon storming in, you may be more satisfied in a Chevy Camaro.  In the final analysis, though, the Mustang has the goods that most people want.  A nice interior, supportive seats, aggressive styling, and decent performance at a competitive price.  It has long been Ford's recipe for success to provide cars that appeal to a wide range of people, and anyone looking for a fast, fun daily driver should take a look at the Mustang.",V8 cylinder ,200," 285 lb-ft @ 3,500 ",, 5-speed manual

Chevy's 6.0-liter V8, available in both light- and heavy-duty versions, has been upgraded to produce 300 horsepower and 370 ft-lbs. of torque, substantially more than Ford and Dodge's biggest gasoline V8s.Standard equipment for heavy-duty models with the 8.1-liter and 6.6-liter engines is a six-speed manual with an extra-low first gear for precise low-speed maneuvering and smooth takeoffs.  Optional is a five-speed automatic with electronically controlled shift points and driver selectable dual-mode operation.  In tow-haul mode the transmission downshifts automatically while descending a grade to reduce brake usage and reverts to a stabilization mode in varying terrain to reduce gear hunting.  All 6.0-liter equipped trucks get either five-speed manuals or four-speed 4L80 automatics carried over from last year.  The awesome engine power and heavy-duty transmissions available in the 2500s translate into unsurpassed trailer towing capacity.  Light-duty 2500s can handle up to 10,800 lbs., while heavy-duty models can tow up to 15,900 with the use of a fifth-wheel hitch.

Hyundai,hyundai santa-fe-hybrid,2022,hyundai santa-fe-hybrid 2022,,"['Not as fuel-efficient as some rival SUV hybrids', 'Touchscreen can be a bit slow to respond']",,"The  Hyundai Santa Fe Hybrid debuted last year as a new entry in the crossover's  already diverse lineup and offers another choice in a still relatively small  group of compact hybrid SUVs. The 2022 Santa Fe Hybrid carries over unchanged,  upstaged only slightly by this year's introduction of a Santa Fe plug-in hybrid  (reviewed separately).  
The  Santa Fe Hybrid adds increased fuel efficiency to the model's core strengths,  which include a comfortable, eye-catching interior, a generous set of standard  features, and a roomy cabin. The Santa Fe Hybrid gets up to 34 mpg combined, 10  more mpg than the gas-only, all-wheel-drive Santa Fe. An appealing price,  standard all-wheel drive, and five-year comprehensive warranty sweeten the  deal. 
The  Santa Fe's size also helps it stand out in the hybrid class. It's larger than  the compact Honda CR-V Hybrid and Ford Escape Hybrid — with more  interior volume and cargo space — but not as large (or unwieldy in  tight confines) as three-row SUVs like the Toyota Highlander Hybrid. 
The  hybrid-powered Toyota Venza shares similar dimensions with the Santa Fe but  doesn't offer near the cabin or cargo space. There's also the Sorento Hybrid,  from Hyundai's sister brand, Kia, which shares similar size, power and features  with the Santa Fe. If you need more space than a typical compact SUV offers  while maintaining high fuel efficiency, move the Santa Fe Hybrid up your list.  In  most lineups, the middle trim, or one near it, typically hits the sweet spot  between a broadly appealing price and a robust set of standard features. It's  tempting to default to the middle choice here, but we actually think the  base-level Blue is the one to get.  It comes with plenty of essentials and extras — heated front seats,  Apple and Android phone connections, a wireless device charger — and  advanced driver aids such as adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitoring.  It also nets the best fuel economy of the three with 34 mpg combined.",Inline 4 cylinder ,121,,, 6-speed shiftable automatic 
Chevrolet,chevrolet express,2014,chevrolet express 2014,,"['Thirstier, less spacious and rougher riding than newer full-size vans', 'cheap cabin plastics.']",4.2,"For 2014, the Chevrolet Express Passenger van has a newly optional CNG (compressed natural gas)-powered 6.0-liter V8 engine. Otherwise, it is essentially unchanged. The full-size 2014 Chevrolet Express van is one of the more versatile and functional passenger vehicles on the road, but it's outdated compared with fresher rivals.  If moving more than a baker's dozen worth of passengers is a  requirement for your next vehicle, then you might consider the 2014 Chevrolet  Express. A traditional full-size van, the Express could be just right for a small  company, a little league team or a really large family. Depending on which body  style you select, the Chevrolet Express can transport  anywhere from eight to 15 passengers or be used to tow nearly 10,000 pounds  when properly equipped.
Direct rivals to the Express are few, and include its  virtually identical GMC Savana cousin and the 2014 Ford  E-Series Wagon. Their  basic architecture is similar (a large, snub-nosed box on wheels), but the GM  vans offer more engine choices, including a compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered  V8 as well as a powerful turbodiesel V8. Available all-wheel drive is another  plus.
But if you're willing to break with tradition, a couple of other  choices offer compelling advantages. The 2014 Mercedes-Benz  Sprinter offers  superior maneuverability, refinement and fuel economy. Yes, it's priced higher  but it also offers a high-roof option that opens up significantly more space  for adults to walk upright inside the van. There's also the Nissan NV, which also  has a high-top roof option plus a more modern design than the Chevrolet. You  could also consider the 2014 Ram ProMaster, which is a new Fiat-built van  offering plenty of interior room.
The 2014 Chevrolet Express is part of a vehicle lineup that  was last redesigned nearly two decades ago. As such, this passenger van is  undeniably dated compared with those aforementioned, more modern and more space-efficient  rivals. Still, Chevy's capable workhorse represents a viable and affordable  option for those who need to transport large groups of people and maybe even  tow a heavy trailer, too. The 2014 Chevrolet  Express offers no fewer than five different powertrains.
The 1500 series  features a 5.3-liter V8 engine making 310 horsepower and 334 pound-feet of  torque, backed by a four-speed automatic transmission and standard rear-wheel  drive. All-wheel drive is optional. The EPA's estimated fuel economy with  either drivetrain is 14 mpg  combined (13 city/17 highway).
The rear-drive-only  2500 and 3500 series get a standard 4.8-liter V8 with 285  and 295 lb-ft of  torque. A 6.0-liter V8 engine generating 342  and 373 lb-ft is optional, as  is a CNG-powered 6.0-liter V8 that makes 282  and 320 lb-ft. All these engines are mated to a six-speed automatic  transmission. Fuel economy with the 4.8-liter is 13 mpg  combined (11 city/17 highway), while the 6.0-liter gas engine also earns 13 mpg  combined (11 mpg city/16mpg highway).
The 3500 series additionally  offers an optional turbocharged 6.6-liter diesel V8 (also matched to a  six-speed automatic) that puts out 260  and 525 lb-ft. The diesel engine is  the more fuel-efficient engine of the two big V8s, but mpg estimates are not  available because the EPA doesn't rate vehicles that weigh more than 6,000  pounds.
Properly equipped, an  Express 3500 can tow a maximum of 10,000 pounds. All 2014 Chevy Express  passenger vans come fitted with antilock brakes, side curtain airbags and  stability control as standard equipment. A rear vision camera, rear parking  sensors and OnStar emergency communications are available as options. Although the full-size passenger van class is a small one,  the 2014 Chevrolet Express doesn't quite meet the current standards set by the  Sprinter and NV. While the Express is certainly capable of moving large groups  of people given its strong available V8 engines, it's not as civilized to drive  around town as it doesn't steer, handle or ride as well as those two rivals. It's  not a bad choice if cost is the primary consideration, but this van feels  outdated, especially in crowded urban environments where it will likely spend  most of its working life. Eight passengers can sit in the standard 1500-series Express  vans, while 12 people can fit in the standard 2500 and 3500 models. The  long-wheelbase version of the 3500 can be fitted with an extra bench seat, which  allows it to carry 15 people.
Controls are simple and easy to use, but there is a lot of  hard plastic trim, and even basic features like carpeting are left on the  options list. Legroom for the driver and front passenger is limited by the  engine cowling that sticks out from the dashboard. Rear legroom is sufficient,  but the standard roof height makes it hard for those in the back to get in and  out without ducking. 
Base LS models come with  16- or 17-inch steel wheels, rear privacy glass, passenger-side swing-out  doors, power windows, front air-conditioning, vinyl upholstery, rubber floor  covering, OnStar and a  two-speaker AM/FM sound system.

Bmw,bmw 3-series,1998,bmw 3-series 1998,['One of our all-time favorite cars.  Carves turns faster than your dad carves Thanksgiving turkey.'],['Price is a bit steep.  Interior is a bit cramped.'],4.8,"BMW swaps out the four-cylinder engine in the 318 coupe and convertible for a 168-horsepower 2.5-liter inline six -- these cars become the 323is coupe and 323i convertible (why it's ""323"" and not ""325,"" we'll never know). Meanwhile, the 318i sedan and 318ti hatchback continue on unchanged. All cars get standard side airbags this year, except the 318ti, on which they are optional. People buy BMWs for a variety of reasons.  BMWs carry an obvious panache that tells the world that you have, indeed, arrived.  Driving a BMW also tells the world that you are a person who is young at heart, someone who may want to change their own gears from time to time; unlike, say, a stuffy owner of a Mercedes-Benz, Lexus or Cadillac.  Lastly, BMWs politely tell people that you like to drive, and to please move out of that left lane so you can pass, thank you.The BMW 3-Series is now in its seventh year of production.  Despite this, the car is still fresh and exciting; evoking powerful feelings of desire and jealousy every time we see one cruising down the street.  This year, the big news is the addition of a zippy little six-pot engine for the entry-level coupe and convertible.  At 2.5-liters, the new engine makes 28 more horsepower and a whopping 48 more foot-pounds of torque than the four-cylinder engine that is still standard on the entry-level hatchback and sedan.  Safety  is another concern that BMW addressed in 1998, adding standard side-impact airbags to all of the 3-Series coupes, sedans and convertibles.The 3-Series is BMW's most popular line of cars because it spans such a broad price range.  Starting at just under $22,000 for the fun and cheap 318ti hatchback, the 3-Series reaches its pinnacle at more than  $40,000 with the outstanding, high-performance M3 coupe, convertible and sedan.  Despite the disparity in prices, the 3-Series models are uniformly fun to drive due to their wonderful chassis, excellent steering and top-notch suspensions.We believe that the purchase of a 3-Series car is one of the best ways to get know that twisty stretch of road that you were always afraid to introduce to your Buick Century.  However, this is definitely not the car for all people, since back seat room is cramped and limited cargo space makes it impractical for large families.  But, if you are a person who enjoys driving, the 3-Series is a nice alternative to muscle car machismo.  We are thrilled that BMW has exercised restraint in these times of overblown excess.  By keeping their revisions to those things that need revising, leaving the core of the vehicle untainted, the 3-Series is able to improve itself, rather than replace itself, every few years.",Inline 4 cylinder ,300," 133 lb-ft @ 4,300 ",, 5-speed manual

Each  of these trucks has bragging rights in one way or another, and they're all  competitive when it comes to maximum capabilities.  
Depending  on the configuration and drivetrain, the Chevy Silverado 3500HD can tow 36,000  pounds with a fifth-wheel/gooseneck-style trailer and can carry up to 7,442  pounds of payload. These numbers fall a little short relative to its rivals,  but the Silverado 3500HD's high-strength steel Durabed offers more capacity  than the competition at 89 cubic feet for the long cargo bed. The Silverado 3500HD  also excels with regard to value as it has the lowest base price of this  quartet of heavy-haulers.
Chevrolet  redesigned the Silverado 3500HD for the 2020 model year and has made few  changes since. That trend continues for the 2022 Silverado 3500HD. The handy  Multi-Flex tailgate is now available for all trim levels, and Chevy is offering  one new paint color and one new 20-inch wheel design. However, the truck's most  glaring flaw — the cheap interior — remains. It will likely  get a major upgrade next year, similar to the interior enhancements the  Silverado 1500 light-duty model received this year.
Ultimately,  your choice in a new heavy-duty truck comes down to personal preference and  your budget. If you like the Silverado 3500HD, chances are you'll find it  agreeable, even if it isn't at the top of its small competitive class. Though  the Silverado 3500HD is built for work, chances are you'll want it to have more  than just the basics. That's why we recommend the LT trim, which is available with all three cab styles. The  Silverado 3500HD LT has a more upscale interior than the more affordable Work  Truck and serves as your ticket to a wider range of optional features that help  you better configure the truck to personal preferences.",V8 cylinder ,160," 464 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 6-speed shiftable automatic

How about dropping an Accord V6 into this bad boy?""]",4.7,"The CR-V gains 20 horsepower, bringing the total output to 146. Automatic transmission models have a revised column shifter with an overdrive switch.  The power window buttons are illuminated, the spare tire cover has been upgraded and the front passenger seat is equipped with an armrest. For years Honda has been selling a sport-utility vehicle that many consider a fraud.  Forget that the Honda Passport is based on the rugged and capable Isuzu Rodeo.  To Honda aficionados, it is not a real Honda.  (Consider how the Porsche 914 fares in the eyes of diehard Porsche fanatics.)  Thus, to many people, the CR-V is the first Honda sport-utility vehicle.Built on the Civic platform, the CR-V successfully integrates familiar Honda components into a fresh new design.  Honda's famous four-wheel double-wishbone suspension makes an appearance on the CR-V (the first-ever application of four-wheel double-wishbone technology on a sport-ute), as does the familiar four-speed automatic transmission, which now comes with an overdrive on/off switch.  The 2.0-liter DOHC inline four-cylinder engine makes 146 horsepower and 133 foot-pounds of torque, up 20 horsepower from last year, thanks to intake and exhaust tuning along with an increased compression ratio.  The CR-V's Real Time four-wheel-drive system is a derivative of the unit that Honda initially offered on their Civic wagon.  All 4WD models come with a five-speed manual transmission, while the four-speed automatic is optional.  A front-wheel-drive model is offered, but it comes only with the automatic transmission.  The result of using all of these car components is not surprising: the CR-V looks and feels like a car.The CR-V's interior is instantly recognizable to anyone who has spent time in Honda's passenger cars.  Functionality takes precedence over style in the CR-V's cabin, and the result is easy-to-read gauges, well-placed controls, and high-quality, if somewhat uninspired, interior materials.  Fit and finish is equal to the highly acclaimed Accord.  Cargo capacity is an impressive 67.2 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded.  The CR-V offers comfortable chairs for its occupants, each of which has excellent visibility and the ability to recline when the trip grows long.  For the first time this year, the front passenger also benefits from a left-side armrest, an item that was missing on previous models.  Rear passengers will also enjoy cupholders, which are now mounted in the door panels.Available in either LX or EX trim levels, the CR-V is surprisingly well-equipped even at the base LX trim level.  Air conditioning with a filtration system is standard, as are power windows, power door locks, rear window wiper and defogger, AM/FM stereo with cassette, cruise control and a folding picnic table that doubles as a cargo area cover.  Antilock brakes are available only on the EX model, which also comes with a CD player and alloy wheels.The CR-V is not meant to replace hard-core recreational vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler or Toyota 4Runner.  Instead, it is meant for the person who wants the functionality of a sport utility without having to pay an exorbitant sticker price and huge gas bills.  The CR-V will get people to work and back in all but the worst weather, and to their favorite picnic area, assuming it's not on the Rubicon Trail.  Best of all, this is a sport-utility vehicle that Honda lovers can finally call their own.",Inline 4 cylinder ,335," 133 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",, 5-speed manual

A mini-module driver airbag is new, but it and the passenger airbag still deploy at full-force levels. Believe it or not, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van lineup when the Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996.  The GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced in 1971, and sold steadily until the end.  Competition and safety regulations forced GM to redo the big vans -- heck, since 1971 Ford had re-engineered the Club Wagon and Econoline twice!  To distinguish the new design, GMC rebadged the van Savana.Savana features flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard antilock brakes and dual airbags.  Doors contain side impact guard beams, though they do not meet 1999 safety standards yet.  Front foot and leg room is adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of fore and aft travel.  Rear heat ducts are standard, but for better warming (and cooling) an optional rear heating and air conditioning unit is available.  Front air conditioning is standard.  The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet and storage for items like CDs and cassettes.  Five sound systems are offered and uplevel units have been improved for 1998.  Savana is available in base SL or luxury SLE trim levels.New for 1998 is a steering wheel with a mini-module airbag.  Rear seats receive seat belt comfort guides, while a new PassLock theft deterrent system is designed to keep thieves from absconding with the Savana.  Automatic transmission refinements result in lower levels of vibration and noise.Buyers may select either a 135-inch or a 155-inch wheelbase.  There is a choice of side-entry doors as well: a sliding door or a pair of 60/40 hinged doors.  Inside the short-wheelbase Savana you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the longer wheelbase model provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume.  Up to 15 passengers can be seated within the longer van, on as many as five bench seats.  Hinged rear doors open 180 degrees for easy loading and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened up.  Gross vehicle weight ratings of up to 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase.The base engine is a Vortec 4300 V6 making 200 horsepower.  Optional motors include the new GM family of V8's, ranging from the popular Vortec 5000 to the monster Vortec 7400.  Also available is a newly robust turbodiesel V8 good for 195 horsepower and 430 stump-pulling ft-lbs. of torque.Like most products in showrooms these days, the Savana's styling is rounded and bulbous, with a front end that mimics the corporate look carried by most of GM's truck family.

All 4Runners have power door locks this year, as well as a prewired trailer hitch harness, a modified grille design and freshened taillights. New wheels for Limited and Sport debut, and a new premium 3-in-1 audio system with a CD changer is available. Revised sun visors with extensions and a HomeLink programmable transmitter come standard on Limited and can be ordered on SR5. Limited also gets a new color of wood trim, and standard front seat heaters. There's bad news for hard-core off-roaders -- the optional differential lock has been discontinued with the demise of the manual transmission. Three new colors replace two old ones on the color chart. A likeable SUV that reminds you, for better or for worse, of its truck-based origins. In the six years since the current 4Runner debuted, the segment of the marketplace in which it competes has exploded in popularity and become littered with fine sport-utes. Yet, Toyota's rugged entry continues to represent an excellent choice, despite its age and distinctly truck-like underpinnings.That's right. If you're looking for a tall car, the 4Runner is likely to disappoint with its stiff ride and general lack of road feel. But if it's a roomy vehicle made for serious off-road work, combined with creature comforts and a solid reputation for reliability, that you're after, then you've come to the right place.For 2001, Toyota has overhauled the 4Runner lineup, limiting selection to two trim levels and a single power plant. Choose from standard SR5 or luxurious Limited outfittings in either two- or four-wheel drive. A 3.4-liter, dual overhead-cam V6, attached to a four-speed automatic transmission, makes 183 tortured horsepower at 4,800 rpm, and peak torque doesn't arrive until you've revved into the middle part of the band. It's adequate, but you'll likely find yourself wishing for more go-power. The manual five-speed transmission and the differential locks that could be added to models with row-'em-yourself gears are gone for 2001.Toyota has added some impressive technology as standard equipment for 2001. Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), traction control and ABS enhanced with electronic brake force distribution and brake assist comes on every new 4Runner. VSC is a stability control system that helps keep the 4Runner under control when a lateral skid is detected. Brake assist can apply maximum braking power under emergency situations quicker than the driver can.Inside, passengers, once they manage to clamber aboard, are greeted by a chunky, purposeful dash that wasn't so much styled as it was pieced together. No matter, it works from an ergonomic standpoint. Seating is comfortable and supportive front and rear, with backseat riders benefiting from plenty of legroom. Cloth upholstery in the SR5 Sport is abrasive, but the Limited has far more pleasing leather hides covering the seats. Limited models have a standard new sun visor design with extensions and a HomeLink transmitter, a setup that is optional on SR5 models.Cargo capacity measures 44.6 cubic feet with the rear seat in use, and 79.8 cubic feet with it folded. Able to tow 5,000 pounds when properly equipped, the 4Runner excels off-road, with as much as 11 inches of ground clearance when the optional P265/70R16 tires are selected. A slick, powered rear window in the hatch, combined with the large, optional sunroof and lowered side glass, results in an open, airy vehicle - much like a convertible, but not.Add the available Sports Package to the SR5, and you'll get a fender-blistered, hood-scooped, monochromatic exterior treatment on the outside with larger brakes, bigger alloy wheels and a performance-oriented rear differential underneath. Limited is loaded with chrome accents, fake wood, heated seats and two-tone paint to set it apart as the more refined choice.4Runner is nevertheless a truck for people who like trucks.

More capable than the F-150 and  F-250 Super Duty, the F-350 is available with six trim levels, three cab styles  and two cargo bed lengths. You can also choose between two gasoline V8 engines  and a turbodiesel V8 and add four-wheel drive and a dual-rear-wheel axle if  that's what you need. Spec the truck to your requirements and the F-350 will be  ready for just about any task or adventure you're planning. 
People often buy the F-350 for its towing  and hauling capabilities. When properly equipped, this heavy-duty full-size  pickup supplies a maximum conventional towing capacity of 21,200 pounds. If you  set the F-350 up for fifth-wheel towing, it can handle a trailer weighing up to  35,750 pounds. Either way, these ratings make the F-350 compatible with most  big recreational and commercial-oriented trailers. If hauling is what you need,  the F-350 can carry a maximum payload of 7,850 pounds in its cargo bed,  depending on the configuration.
To make the F-350 appealing to the  largest number of customers possible, Ford makes it available in a range of  models spanning from a basic work truck to a plush and technologically advanced  luxury model. If you spend lots of time off-road, consider the F-350's Tremor  package for its added capability when the going gets tough. Ford even offers an  integrated winch for the Tremor that supplies 12,000 pounds of capacity.
This year, Ford makes a few changes to  further improve the F-350's appeal. The King Ranch and Platinum trims join the  Limited in offering standard four-wheel drive and 20-inch wheels, and all but  the two most affordable versions of the truck get a new 12-inch touchscreen  display that's an upgrade over the base 4.2- or 8-inch screen. Ford also offers  the F-350 XLT and Lariat with new appearance packages.
While change is inevitable, these things  about the Ford F-350 remain the same. This rig works hard, plays hard, and  looks good doing it. Choosing  just one version of the F-350 to recommend is hard, but we think the Lariat trim offers the best blend of  price, configurations, equipment, and access to upgrades in the F-350 lineup.  Additionally, the Lariat is available with the Tremor off-road package and this  year's two new appearance packages. It is the best all-arounder in the lineup.",V8 cylinder ,220," 1,050 lb-ft @ 1,600 ",, 10-speed shiftable automatic

Let that sink in for a  minute. It's been 27 years since the Express debuted, and while this model has  received updates over the decades, it is not much different from the original  version that rolled out in 1996. That makes the Express a classic vehicle that  you can buy brand-new today. 
There  are two main reasons to put a 2022 Chevrolet Express at the top of your  shopping list. The first reason is that you have a tight budget. The Express  and its near identical twin, the GMC Savana, are the most affordable full-size  vans available. The second reason is that you need to tow as much as 10,000  pounds. The Express (and Savana) are the only vehicles in their segment that  can do that.
Otherwise,  compared to its rivals, the Express has fallen behind the times. Notably, this  van does not come with a high-roof option that makes for easy loading and  unloading of passengers or allows it to accommodate more cargo. Rivals such as  the Ford Transit and Ram ProMaster also have nicer interiors, modern  infotainment systems, smoother rides and more safety technology.
These  shortcomings make an Express appealing only when you need its towing capacity  or your budget cannot accommodate the alternatives. If those benefits of  Express ownership don't apply to you, we recommend looking at the competition  before putting a ring on this Chevy.  The  Express Cargo Van comes only in the WT trim, so we're going to focus our  recommendation on the Express Passenger Van. Here we recommend the LT trim level for its expanded  equipment list that makes it easier to live with an Express on a daily basis,  such as carpeting, cloth seats and other features that you might assume are  standard but aren't included with the LS trim.",V6 cylinder ,255," 298 lb-ft @ 3,900 ",, 8-speed shiftable automatic

An updated Command Trac four-wheel-drive system allows automatic four-wheel-drive operation when required. Spruce Green, Harvest Gold, Tropic Green and Deep Wedgewood Blue replace Light Prairie Tan, Vermont Green, Light Denim Blue and Pacific Green on the color chart. After allowing GM to dominate the full-size SUV arena for years, Ford introduced a vehicle in 1997 that had its sights squarely aimed at the Chevy Tahoe,  GMC Yukon, and the Suburban sold at both Chevy and GMC dealerships.  Ford boasts that its Expedition is superior to the GM full-size sport/utes in every way.  We had the chance to drive many of these brute-utes since its introduction, and here is what we found out.Larger than the Tahoe and Yukon, the Expedition can seat nine people with its optional third-row bench seat; the Tahoe and Yukon can only seat six.  Unlike the Suburban, which may have difficulty fitting into a standard garage, the Expedition can be accommodated in most residential garages.  The Expedition also has the best payload and towing capacity in its class: 2,000-lbs. and 8000-lbs. respectively.On the road the Expedition is well mannered.  It's obvious that this is not a car, but compared to the old Bronco, the Expedition rides like a limousine.  Interior ergonomics are first rate and will be familiar to anyone who has spent time in the current F-150.  From the front seat forward the Expedition is nearly identical to the new pickup.  That's a good thing; we love the cab of the new F-150 with its easy-to-use climate and stereo controls, steering wheel-mounted cruise control, plenty of cupholders, and great storage space.  Ford has put a lot of time and money into making this truck the next sales leader in their already dominant light-truck lineup.  We came away impressed and think you will too. The Expedition comes standard with dual airbags, antilock brakes, and fold-flat second row seats; features that we feel are important in this increasingly competitive segment. Our few gripes stem from the powertrain.  Ford has boosted output for both the 4.6 and 5.4-liter engines, making them somewhat more competitive against the awesome Vortec powerplants found in GM's full-size trucks.  One option that we think everyone should investigate is the lighted running boards. The Expedition towers above the ground, and entering and exiting this truck will take its toll on most passengers after a few days.Ford has shuffled several of the packages on the 1999 Expedition, and has added a number of features to the standard equipment lists of the Eddie Bauer and XLT.  Ford has rolled the contents of the former Popular Equipment Group into the Comfort and Convenience Group.  The group now includes 16-inch wheels, privacy glass, removable fold-flat third seat, and captain's chairs with floor console.The Ford Expedition is a nice balance between comfort and function, and its ability to seat nine people makes it popular with large families and those who have to haul stuff around.  Nevertheless, we can't overlook the new Dodge Durango and the outstanding Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon when discussing big trucks.  In the last few years, the mid- and full-size sport-ute market has gotten very competitive and the choices are much more difficult to make.",V8 cylinder ,149," 293 lb-ft @ 3,500 ",, 4-speed automatic

Honda also ups the safety features list, making dual-stage, dual-threshold front airbags standard and side airbags available on all models. All Accords now either meet or exceed California's low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards (some Accords meet ULEV standards, and one model sold in California is rated SULEV). Improvements aimed at reducing road and wind noise have been made, while EX models get a standard in-dash six-disc CD changer, and all V6 models come with traction control. Midyear, a DX four-banger equipped with a special value package debuted, adding an automatic transmission, air conditioning, a CD player, floor mats, fake wood interior accents and special exterior trim. No question as to why the Accord is one of the top-selling cars in America. It's simply good. The benchmark. The best-selling car in America. The highest resale value in its class. These are all statements that have been made with regularity concerning the Honda Accord, a vehicle that is always on the short list of the most popular cars in this country. The Accord won a loyal base of customers by offering notable performance, room for four, frugal fuel economy and a virtual guarantee that, if cared for properly, it would not break.This sixth-generation Accord is available in coupe and sedan bodies, equipped with basic DX (sedan only), mid-grade LX, or loaded EX trim. The standard 2.3-liter four-banger in the DX Sedan is worth 135 horses. LX and EX models come with a VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) engine, in your choice of 2.3-liter four-cylinder (which generates 150 horsepower) or 3.0-liter V6 (200 horsepower) configurations.The spunky fours can be mated to a slick-shifting manual or four-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The V6, available only with the automatic, is a model of refinement, revving smoothly and silently.Now that we've praised the living daylights out of this car, here's some bad news: The low price of the DX is accompanied by a low level of equipment. Also, the Accord is easy to drive, but it doesn't reward the driver much for the efforts. You won't mistake this for a performance car -- look to the Nissan Maxima for competent canyon carving. The Accord is suited more to daily driving in the urban jungle, featuring decent acceleration, strong brakes and light, effortless steering. As with the Toyota Camry, refinement and attention to detail are the Accord's strengths. Almost all interior materials are pleasing to the eye and touch, and are assembled with great care. Gap tolerances are about half what you'd find in competing American products. Storage room abounds; the Accord mimics a minivan with so many places to stash maps, drinks, change, and assorted detritus. Spacious, comfortable and quiet, the Accord will tote many happy campers for miles on end as long as they don't mind the stiff highway ride. The seats are comfortable, both front and rear, and ergonomics are nearly flawless. While not exactly spicy, the Honda Accord is the definitive family sedan or personal coupe. A low price, a high level of refinement, a cavernous interior, and a well-deserved reputation for reliability put the Accord at the top of the heap. Even a loaded EX V6 model with leather, alloy wheels, power moonroof, automatic climate control, CD player, premium sound, and steering-wheel radio controls struggles to surpass the $25,000 mark.

Not as original as the original.'],4.9,"Mazda cautiously redesigns the MX-5 Miata, improving the car in every way without bumping up the price or diluting the car's personality. Mazda's MX-5 Miata is still the best roadster on the market today. Sure, Germany has unleashed the BMW Z3, the Mercedes SLK and the Porsche Boxster, but none of them can match the Mazda for sheer bang for the buck.The MX-5 Miata is about simplicity in design and operation. It's about having fun behind the wheel. It's about feeling free and young on warm summer nights. Not a serious car, the MX-5 Miata, but that is this Mazda's charm.Knuckleheads driven by large quantities of testosterone will dismiss the Miata as a woman's car. They don't know what they are talking about. Purists will dismiss the Miata in favor of the German convertibles, citing bloodline and heritage as worthy attributes that the Mazda does not possess. These are people who haven't driven any of the four, in most cases. We've driven the current crop of two-seat roadsters, and while some members of our staff refuse to openly admit that the Miata is the better car, it is an unspoken understanding that Mazda builds the superior roadster for the dollar.Redesigned from the ground up, the 1999 MX-5 Miata has been improved upon in every way. The car is faster and more rigid, and sports updated styling that strays just far enough from the original to be fresh but not so far as to dilute the traditional Miata profile. In some ways, the new car is better-looking than the first-generation model, thanks to its wider tail and more sculpted bodywork. In other ways, well, let's just say those new exposed headlights remind us a bit too much of a Mercury Sable.Trunk room is up substantially, and a windblocker is available to cut down on the number of bad hair days Miata drivers may suffer. The familiar 1.8-liter twin-cam engine makes more power and torque than last year, thanks to a new cylinder head that benefits from improved flow as well as a higher compression ratio. (California residents: your Miatas make slightly less power and torque than in the other 49 states.) Manual transmissions shift more smoothly and automatics are recalibrated to improve performance. A stiffer, stronger body and chassis coupled with revised steering and suspension settings make the new Miata more responsive, while a wider track provides better stability in corners. The cowl shake of the old Miata is quelled substantially thanks to structural improvements. Four-wheel disc brakes are standard, and the fronts are ventilated. The passenger-side airbag can be switched off, so pre-teen kids can enjoy top-down thrills in the new car. The 1999 version has a glass rear window with a standard defogger. A CD player comes installed in every Miata, and audiophiles who opt for the right package can crank tunes on a 200-watt Bose audio system. The revised interior is very nicely done, with well-integrated stereo and climate systems, the latter of which employs rotary dials to control settings. A sharp three-spoke steering wheel can be replaced by a leather-wrapped Nardi version. There is one Miata model available, but it can be dressed up with any of four different packages: a Touring package, a Popular Equipment package, a Leather package or the race-ready Sports package.There's also a limited-edition 10th Anniversary MX-5 Miata that features a six-speed transmission, Sapphire Blue Mica exterior color, blue softtop with blue boot and blue interior trim. Chrome rings surround the speedometer and tachometer and a carbon fiber-like material covers the center console. A gift set (including his-and-hers Seiko watches, as well as a 1/43 scale 10Th Anniversary model) is also part of the package.

You'd have to  search hard to find a load that would outmatch this heavyweight. Only a few  trucks offer the same performance and capabilities as the Sierra 3500HD, and a  couple of them — the Ram 3500 and Ford F-350 Super Duty particularly  — have an edge on the GMC thanks to roomy and more comfortable cabins  with slightly nicer interiors. 
That's  saying something, as the Sierra once held the distinction of being the most  handsome and best-dressed in this category. And certainly in its Denali trim,  the Sierra still impresses as a truck equally at home in the valet line or the  oil fields. The mechanically identical Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD offers nearly  all the same features in a slightly plainer — and cheaper —  truck-ish package. It's a viable option if capability and affordability are  priorities over style. Ultimately, the Sierra 3500HD easily satisfies if you're  looking for a rugged, dashing and massively capable pickup.  Given  the Sierra 3500HD's multiple trims and configurations, it's difficult to pick a  single model.

How to you choose between a Chevrolet or GMC full-size van? Which dealer is closest to your house? They're basically the same vehicle. They both stack up well against the formidable Ford Econoline and ancient Dodge Ram Van, so if the Savana provides what you need in this kind of vehicle, buy it. When the then-new Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van. The GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced way back in 1971 (when vans were still groovy), and sold steadily until they were finally discontinued. Competition and safety regulations had forced GM to redo the big vans for '96, but by then Ford had already re-engineered its Econoline and Club Wagon twice! To help distinguish GM's all-new, rounded-off design, GMC rebadged its new van Savana.Savana is available in 135- and 155-inch wheelbases, three weight series (1500, 2500 or 3500) and as either a passenger van for retail customers or as a cargo van for commercial use. Cargo vans come with stripped-down interiors, ready for upfitting with tool racks or parts bins. Passenger vans are available with seating for eight, 12 or 15 people, depending on wheelbase, and in two different trim levels (base SL and luxury SLE). There's even a choice of side-entry doors: a slider or a set of 60/40 hinged doors. GM's full-size vans feature flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard four-wheel antilock brakes and dual airbags. Front foot- and legroom is adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of travel. Front air conditioning and rear heat ducts are standard. The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet and storage for items like CDs and cassettes. Inside the short-wheelbase Savana, you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the extended version provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume with the rear seats removed. Rear hinged doors open a full 180 degrees for easy loading and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened. For hauling, gross vehicle weight ratings of up to 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase.The base engine is a 200-horsepower Vortec 4300 V6. Optional motors include a 220-horse Vortec 5000 V8, the venerable 255-horse Vortec 5700 V8, and GM's new Vortec 8100 Big Block V8 that makes 340 ponies and a whopping 455 foot-pounds of torque. Also available is a robust 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 good for 195 horsepower and 430 foot-pounds of torque. GM's heavy-duty 4L80-E transmission handles all the shifting chores.Savana's styling is rounded and bulbous, with a broad front end that mimics GM's truck family and a high-arched rear with tall, thin taillights mounted up along the D-pillars. Easily as odd-looking as the old Lumina minivan's high-mounted rear lamps, the round-topped rear end and sheer size of this van make it seem as if you are looking at the back end of some sort of commuter train car. But since most retail buyers have moved to minivans and much of the full-size van business has centered on converters and fleet use, Savana's styling takes a back seat to its modern mechanicals and long service life.",V6 cylinder ,134," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 4-speed automatic

Improvements to the V6 and GT suspension and steering gear, as well as a styling update. Ford gives the Mustang a makeover for its 35th birthday.  An entire exterior redo includes revised front and rear clips, new taillamps and headlights; fresh door, hood, decklid and quarter panel sheetmetal; and redone rocker panel moldings, side scoops, and C-pillar appliques.  The big news, however, is the under-skin changes that include engine output improvements, steering gear enhancements, and gains in rear suspension performance.Ford's Mustang has outsold the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird combined for the last four years.  Remember that this is in spite of the fact that the Mustang has suffered a performance disadvantage since its redesign in 1994. Nevertheless, Ford executives seem to have gotten sick of automotive journalists and gearheads griping about the Mustang's power deficit, so the Blue Oval gang has massaged both the 3.8-liter V6 and the 4.6-liter V8, improving power output to respectable levels for 1999.  The V6 now makes 190 horsepower @ 5250 and 220 foot-pounds of torque @ 3000 rpm.  The V8 that's found in the GT's engine bay makes 260 horsepower @ 5000 and 302 foot-pounds of torque @ 4000 rpm.If the standard GT powerplant doesn't satisfy your urge-to-merge with highway traffic, a highly advanced SVT Cobra model is available for the 1999 model year. Not only does this pony feature more horsepower  (320 @ 6000 rpm), but it comes standard with independent rear suspension, a first in the Mustang's 35-year history. We think that part of the previous Mustang's sales success can be attributed to the car's comfortable interior.  Since 1994, the 'Stang has offered drivers and passengers supportive upright front chairs, well-placed controls, clear views out the front and side windows, and nice dashboard and seat materials.  They have upped the ante for sports car comfort in 1999, giving the driver and front passenger seats an additional inch of aft adjustment.  Also appearing in the 1999 Mustang is new leather and cloth upholstery, new interior colors, and improved placement of the power seat controls.The Mustang driving experience is enhanced by new steering gear, which reduces kickback, gives the Mustang a tighter turning radius, and increases road feel.  The rear suspension has more travel than last year, smoothing out the bumps that could easily upset the previous model.  Ford has also made four-wheel antilock brakes standard on the GT.The Mustang has always been crashworthy, offering drivers and front seat passengers the highest level of protection as rated by the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration (NHTSA).  This year Ford increases the Mustang's ability to stay out of a wreck by offering all-speed traction control on the car for the first time.  Ford thoughtfully provided a traction control defeat switch for the kid in all of us.Mustang is one of the most recognizable nameplates on the road.

Each  of these trucks has bragging rights in one way or another, and they're all  competitive when it comes to maximum capabilities.  
Depending  on the configuration and drivetrain, the Chevy Silverado 3500HD can tow 36,000  pounds with a fifth-wheel/gooseneck-style trailer and can carry up to 7,442  pounds of payload. These numbers fall a little short relative to its rivals,  but the Silverado 3500HD's high-strength steel Durabed offers more capacity  than the competition at 89 cubic feet for the long cargo bed. The Silverado 3500HD  also excels with regard to value as it has the lowest base price of this  quartet of heavy-haulers.
Chevrolet  redesigned the Silverado 3500HD for the 2020 model year and has made few  changes since. That trend continues for the 2022 Silverado 3500HD. The handy  Multi-Flex tailgate is now available for all trim levels, and Chevy is offering  one new paint color and one new 20-inch wheel design. However, the truck's most  glaring flaw — the cheap interior — remains. It will likely  get a major upgrade next year, similar to the interior enhancements the  Silverado 1500 light-duty model received this year.
Ultimately,  your choice in a new heavy-duty truck comes down to personal preference and  your budget. If you like the Silverado 3500HD, chances are you'll find it  agreeable, even if it isn't at the top of its small competitive class. Though  the Silverado 3500HD is built for work, chances are you'll want it to have more  than just the basics. That's why we recommend the LT trim, which is available with all three cab styles. The  Silverado 3500HD LT has a more upscale interior than the more affordable Work  Truck and serves as your ticket to a wider range of optional features that help  you better configure the truck to personal preferences.",V8 cylinder ,195," 464 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 6-speed shiftable automatic

Some cars make you feel like a champion. This one makes you feel like a hero. With its ultra-low-drag styling, aluminum body structure and innovative Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) powertrain, the two-passenger Insight can travel as far as 70 miles on a gallon of gas (theoretically, with a 10.6-gallon fuel tank, you can drive from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City and still have a gallon of gas in reserve).The heart of the system is a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine coupled with an electric motor that assists the gasoline engine under acceleration. The package features an idle-stop feature, which shuts off the engine when the driver places the shift lever in neutral and releases the clutch pedal. Unlike GM's all-electric EV1, the Insight requires no external power supply to recharge the 144-volt nickel metal hydride batteries. Regenerative braking via the ABS-assisted disc/drum brakes provides juice to the system. With a full charge and the electric motor providing full assist, the Insight accelerates swiftly, but passing power is lacking.The five-speed manual transmission has relatively short first, second and third gears for good city driving performance, with tall overdrive gearing in fourth and fifth to maximize fuel economy.Like the Acura NSX's, the Insight's unitized body is made of aluminum (except for the front fenders, which are made from plastic) and boasts a drag coefficient of only 0.25. Thanks to its aerodynamic bodywork, flat underbody, low rolling resistance tires and extensive use of lightweight materials, the Insight requires 30 percent less power to operate at highway speeds than the previous-generation Honda Civic.But the effort to save weight pays a price in the handling department. The Insight is highly susceptible to crosswinds, and the narrow tires easily track any groove in the pavement, causing the driver to adjust the steering continually to compensate.The Insight's interior is just as futuristic as the exterior, with a sweeping dash and a high-tech LCD analog/digital instrument display. Divided into three sections, the cluster displays engine rpm, coolant temperature and the engine's idiot lights on the left bank; a large digital speedometer, odometer, lifetime fuel economy bar graph and instant fuel economy in the middle; and fuel level, battery level indicator and the electric motor charge and assist indicator on the right bank.Dual high-back bucket seats feature good lateral and lumbar support. Controls for power windows, mirrors, AM/FM cassette stereo, ventilation and available climate controls are all within easy reach, but two large adults might find themselves knocking elbows in the tight cockpit. Built fully equipped (the only option is an automatic air conditioning system) with power windows, door locks, exterior mirrors, an AM/FM cassette stereo, dual airbags, rear window defroster and a whole lot more, the Insight is an incredible value -- for a hybrid vehicle.Despite the handling shortcomings and quick-to-drain batteries, Honda has brought forth a realistic ultra-low-emission daily driver with electric assist that can be taken anywhere without the worry of having to find an electrical outlet for battery-charging. Despite the arrival of the four-passenger Toyota Prius on the market, we bet Honda will sell every Insight it can produce.",Inline 3 cylinder ,150," 91 lb-ft @ 2,000 ",, 5-speed manual 
Chevrolet,chevrolet tahoe,2001,chevrolet tahoe 2001,"['Strong engines, roomy interior, truck-like durability.']","['Spotty build quality, dated interior design.']",4.7,"Two new exterior colors and OnStar availability are the only changes for 2001. A refined and fully capable SUV for the 21st century. Chevrolet is calling their new Tahoe a ""real"" sport utility, implying that sport-utes are more about getting things done than doing them in style. With nearly every automaker offering an SUV these days, it takes a lot of effort to be unique. However, despite differing opinions of what does and what does not constitute a good SUV (i.e., BMW's X5), the 2001 Tahoe has a whole lot going for it. Built on the same platform as GM's full-size trucks, the Tahoe inherits the strength and durability of its workhorse brethren.  A full redesign last year gave the Tahoe new sheetmetal with enhanced corrosion protection and stronger dent-resistant steel.  GM engineers further enhanced Tahoe's sturdiness with redesigned door hinges that last four times as long, while a unique front-end crush cap allows easy replacement in the event of a slow speed crash. Under the hood, the 2001 Tahoe comes with Chevy's powerful Vortec V8 engines, offering 275 horsepower from the 4.8-liter motor on the base model and 285 horsepower from the 5.3-liter motor on the LS and LT models. All that power runs through an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Even with class-leading levels of power, these engines lead their competition in fuel economy and are compliant with low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards, making them safer for driving in Mother Nature's backyard.The powertrain underwent extensive improvements last year with the addition of a more durable rear axle, a strengthened differential case, and stiffer axle shafts. But Chevy didn't bump up its off-road durability at the expense of the highway drive. With a 400 percent increase in body-mount structure stiffness and a five-link rear suspension, the redesign provides a smoother, quieter and more stable ride on virtually all road surfaces.Inside is an innovative 50/50 split third-row seat that provides superior cargo flexibility and the possibility to boost passenger capacity to nine. Those eight other people will be better protected because this Tahoe has a host of advanced safety features, including four-wheel, ventilated disc antilock brakes, front-seat side-impact airbags, seat-mounted safety belts in the first- and third-row outboard positions, and an energy-absorbing foam on the interior surfaces, reducing the chances that your less-than-bright friends will hurt their heads while exiting. Hardcore off-road enthusiasts can order the Z71 off-road package, which gives the sturdy Tahoe an even greater assortment of protective equipment.  A specially tuned suspension with larger shocks and jounce bumpers are added along with underbody skid plates to shield vital components.  A locking rear differential and aggressively treaded tires aid in the traction department while a roof rack and special ""Z71"" appearance badges give it a distinctive look.  All Z71 Tahoes also come standard with the OnStar vehicle assistance system just in case you venture a little too far from civilization. This Tahoe is one tough truck that can still handle itself well about town.  With a roomy and comfortable interior, it makes for a great weekend-getaway machine. If you want a sport utility that can handle passengers and cargo as well as it does a backcountry road, the 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe should be on your short list.",V8 cylinder ,142," 290 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 4-speed automatic

A new 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine is now the base engine for the SE, available with an optional three-speed automatic.  New colors include Chili Pepper Red, Emerald Green and Deep Amethyst. Some things never change much, and the Jeep Cherokee is one of those mainstays. Unlike its posh--and bigger--Grand Cherokee brother, which keeps adding comforts and graceful touches, the ever-practical, affordable Cherokee simply keeps on rolling, looking little different now than when it was first introduced in 1984. This year, however, the Cherokee benefits from some overdue updates, including a new three-speed automatic transmission, optional with the 2.5-liter SE model.Utilitarian and upright it is, but with a compelling personality that even the Grand Cherokee lacks. The Cherokee Country has been replaced by two new trim levels: Classic and Limited. Four adults fit inside the Cherokee in reasonable comfort, with adequate headroom. Rear legroom is lacking, in a very short seat, and entry to the rear is constricted by a narrow door. Worth noting is the fact that the rear bench folds but doesn't offer a split, meaning you can't haul a toddler and a treadmill simultaneously.Relatively refined on the road, the compact Cherokee is capable of strutting its stuff when the going gets rough. Acceleration is brisk with the 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine, courtesy of 190 horsepower, and we highly recommend this upgrade if you select the SE model. The Cherokee's 4.0-liter engine puts the ""sport"" into sport utility.SE and Sport models can have two or four doors, while the step-up Classic and Limited editions are four-door only. All are available with either two- or four-wheel drive. Command-Trac part-time four-wheel drive allows shift-on-the-fly operation. Selec-Trac is Jeep's full-time four-wheel drive system. Standard gear includes power steering, tinted glass and power front disc brakes. Four-wheel antilock braking is optional (six-cylinder only), as are power windows and door locks, keyless entry system, cruise control, air conditioning and leather seats.Despite its age, the original compact Jeep sport-utility remains a sensible choice in its field, more capable than most SUVs of heading into the woods at a moment's notice.

A larger battery gives more electric-only range than the outgoing Prius Plug-in, while its fuel efficiency in hybrid mode edges higher than that of the base Prius. Compared to the base Prius, the Prius Prime packs a  larger battery that supports approximately 25 miles of electric-only range and,  crucially, can be recharged by plugging into an electrical port. Replenishing  the battery via a regular wall 120-volt socket takes about 5.5 hours, while a  Level 2 (240-volt) charger shortens this time to a little more than two hours.  Of course, you could also choose to never plug it in and simply refuel with  gasoline, and it will operate simply as a more efficient Prius.  Accommodating the larger lithium-ion battery meant  turning the Prius Prime it into a four-seater (the regular Prius seats five)  and raising the loading height of its cargo area. To recoup some of the lost  cargo space, the Prime is 6.5 inches longer than the base Prius; most of that  extra length extends aft of the rear wheels. The bigger battery adds weight,  too, a change that the suspension struggles to deal with at times. Among plug-in hybrids, the 2017 Toyota Prius Prime stands out for its fuel economy and accessible price. Its electric-only range has grown substantially, though it comes at the cost of a few passenger and cargo space compromises. The suspension struggles to manage the extra weight of the Prime's larger battery pack. One result is exaggerated motions over rises and crests. Though the range-topping Advanced trim level is packed with a long list of tech features, it commands a large premium over the others. Going with the mid-grade Premium trim level is the approach we recommend because the Premium better aligns with the Prius Prime's value proposition. It's also the cheapest way to get the significantly larger (11.6-inch) central touchscreen, which is a big improvement over the base 7-inch screen. In the bargain, the Premium adds upgraded cabin materials and a power driver seat, plus keyless entry/start and wireless smartphone charging.  The Plus trim level isn’t quite bare-bones,  but you know you’re in the base model. It has a 7-inch multimedia screen, cloth  seats with manual adjustments, Bluetooth, a USB port and keyless entry for the  driver only.  Stepping  up one rung to the Premium trim  level puts you into the Prius Prime’s sweet spot. It includes a power driver  seat, an 11.6-inch central touchscreen and upgraded multimedia system, premium  synthetic leather (SofTex) seats, automatic headlights, keyless entry on three  doors, satellite radio and wireless smartphone charging. The Advanced trim level adds a raft of  technology features: premium audio, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic  alert, a heated steering wheel, an auto-dimming mirror, a head-up display, a  smartphone app with a charge management system and remote climate control  operation, rain-sensing wipers and a semi-automated parking function.",Inline 4 cylinder ,170,,, Continuously variable-speed automatic

Air conditioning is now standard on all trim levels along with extendable sunshade visors and redesigned exterior badging. GMC makes a pretty good pick-'em-up, if powerful engines are your thing. But it has a ways to go to match the Ford F-250 Super Duty when it comes to the quality of the materials and rugged good looks. Debuting last year with an all-new design, the Sierra 2500HD is one tough truck built to handle the most severe on-the-job duties. Although it does share some engine and drivetrain components with the standard 2500, this heavy-duty model features additional hardware that allows it to boast some of the highest tow ratings of any truck on the market.GMC prides itself on being called ""Professional Grade,"" so stout drivetrains are a must. The base engine on the 2500HD is a 6.0-liter Vortec V8 rated at 300 horsepower and 360 pound-feet of torque, easily out-muscling Ford's 5.4-liter Triton V8 (260, 350 lb-ft) and Dodge's 5.9-liter V8 (245, 345 lb-ft). If that's not enough grunt under the hood, the Sierra offers two even more powerful options: an 8.1-liter Vortec V8 or the 6.6-liter Duramax turbodiesel. The Vortec 8100 boasts an impressive 340  and 455 lb-ft of torque, higher numbers than even its competitor's V10s can muster. The Duramax diesel also generates impressive power with 300  and 520 lb-ft of torque. All that power won't do much unless there's a sturdy transmission behind it to put it to the ground. All 6.0-liter-equipped 2500s come with the New Venture 4500 five-speed manual as standard equipment, while the 4L80-E four-speed automatic is optional. All Sierras equipped with either the Vortec 8100 or Duramax turbodiesel come standard with a ZF six-speed manual featuring fully synchronized gears, synthetic gear oil and an ultra-low first gear for smooth slow-speed maneuvering. Optional on the big engines is an Allison 1000 five-speed overdrive automatic. This transmission is electronically controlled for precisely timed shifts and will automatically downshift on grades to provide engine braking. It's also the first automatic transmission to feature Power Take-Off (PTO) capability, delivering up to 250 lb-ft of continuous torque to worksite equipment. Supporting all this heavy-duty hardware is a fully independent torsion bar suspension in front and a semi-floating solid axle in the rear with two-stage leaf springs. Four-wheel disc brakes with ABS and GM's Hydro-Boost brake proportioning system are standard on all models. Standard tires are E-load range 245/75R16s mounted on eight-lug steel wheels. Maximum towing capacity for 6.0-liter-equipped Sierras is 10,500 pounds while Vortec 8100 and Duramax diesel-equipped models can tow up to 12,000 pounds on a standard trailer. All Sierras are available in three different trim levels: SL, SLE and SLT. SL trim trucks come standard with a 40/20/40 split bench seat, air conditioning, a tilt steering wheel, 17 function driver message center and deep tinted glass. Mid-grade SLE models add power windows and door locks, remote keyless entry, an AM/FM/CD stereo, cruise control and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Top-of-the-line SLTs come with power heated leather seats, the OnStar communications system, a self-dimming rearview mirror with a built-in compass and power heated exterior mirrors. With big, comfortable seats and a solid ergonomic design, all Sierras sport roomy cabins with plenty of head, leg and hip room. Extended cab models have a surprising amount of space for rear-seat passengers and clamshell rear doors on both sides for easy access. While we don't think the evolutionary styling of GM's heavy-duty pickups connotes the brute appeal of a Ford Super Duty or the big-nosed 3500-series Dodge, we do know that they will beat them when it comes to good ol' pullin' and haulin.'

But if wagons are still your jam, check out the 2021 Audi A6 Allroad.  Introduced just last year, this wagon version of the midsize A6 luxury sedan  has received Audi's Allroad treatment. What's that? It's mostly cosmetic stuff  to make this wagon look more rugged and SUV-like, but an extra inch or so of  ground clearance does give it a modicum of off-road capability. The  A6 Allroad does have more room for junk in the trunk. The cargo area more than  doubles, from 13.7 cubic feet of trunk space in the A6 sedan to an even 30  cubes in the Allroad. Overall, we find the A6 Allroad to be a decent pick in  the luxury wagon class, but its ho-hum driving experience and high price put it  at a disadvantage compared to the Mercedes-Benz E-Class All-Terrain and Volvo  V90 Cross Country. Check out our Expert Rating below for all of the details. There's  really nothing wrong with choosing the base Premium Plus trim. But, for a  modest price bump, the Prestige comes  with the Premium Plus' desirable Executive package and other goodies. It also  opens the door to the Luxury package, should you decide to upgrade even  further. How does the A6 allroad drive? The A6 Allroad is only available with one engine — Audi's 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 — and it's the party piece of this big wagon. At our test track, the A6 Allroad zipped from 0 to 60 mph in just 5.3 seconds, a very quick time for the class. Its seven-speed automatic transmission shifts quickly and smoothly. Unfortunately, it falls behind in other areas of the driving experience.     The Allroad's brakes feel spongy in daily driving, the steering is vague, and handling is compromised by the higher-than-average ride height and off-road-oriented tires. Off-road capability is better than average for the segment, with an adjustable suspension that gives the Allroad more ground clearance, but the long front and rear overhangs limit capability overall. How comfortable is the A6 allroad? An ultra-quiet interior, comfortable seats and smooth highway ride make for an excellent combination in the Allroad. The optional Contour Seating package provides supportive and well-padded front seats, while the rear seats are just as well suited to long drives. The standard air suspension and big tire sidewalls combine to absorb almost all bumps, big and small.     Thanks to the optional dual-pane acoustic glass, the Allroad's interior is whisper quiet. The climate control cools things down quickly inside the large cabin, but there is a pretty steep learning curve for the touchscreen controls. Heated and ventilated seats work well too, so achieving the perfect temperature inside is easy. How’s the interior? The Allroad's cabin is spacious, with plenty of room for adults in all four main seating positions. There's lots of headroom, legroom and shoulder room — it's at the head of the class in this regard. The driving position gives you a commanding view of the road thanks to the Allroad's higher-than-standard ride height. That higher ride height also makes it easier to get in and out of.     Outward visibility is good, though the large front pillars impede the view somewhat. But the side and rearview windows are large, and the Allroad comes standard with an excellent 360-degree camera for fitting into tight spaces. It take a bit of time, but after a few days in the A6, all the controls feel relatively intuitive to use and are easily within reach. How’s the tech? The dual-screen infotainment and climate system can seem daunting, but tech-savvy users willing to adjust to the lack of physical buttons will get the hang of it after a few days and it becomes very easy to use. Driver aids such as adaptive cruise control and blind-spot monitoring work well too.     The Virtual Cockpit configurable instrument cluster is genuinely useful in putting maps as well as vehicle and engine speed data right where they're needed. It's augmented by an extremely crisp full-color head-up display and a powerful standard audio system. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard and connect quickly, but if you don't want to connect, the A6's native voice command system is easy to use and it understands natural language. How’s the storage? Compared to a standard A6, the Allroad wagon has impressive trunk space and 1.4 inches of additional rear headroom. But compared to other luxury wagon rivals, the Allroad is merely average. Its trunk offers 30 cubic feet of storage space, but wagons from Mercedes and Volvo offer more space.     Small-item storage is average too, with a few cupholders, an adequate-size center console and slender door pockets. The rear seat has enough space to fit most child seats, with easy-to-locate anchor and tether points in the outboard seating positions. How’s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates that the A6 Allroad will return 22 mpg combined (20 city/26 highway). That's a little bit below average for luxury wagons with upgraded powertrains, but during our test, the A6 was relatively efficient. On our 115-mile mixed-driving evaluation route, it achieved 25.8 mpg. Is the A6 allroad a good value? The A6 Allroad, like its sedan brother, offers an extremely well-built cabin with attractive materials that are pleasant to see and to touch. Even against rivals from BMW and Mercedes, the Audi feels top-notch. Fuel economy estimates are average for the segment, as is the Audi's four-year/50,000-mile warranty.     Our test vehicle was the top trim, Prestige. It comes with several desirable safety features, as well as a long list of creature comforts. However, Audi's asking price is a lot more than what you'd have to pay to get a similar Volvo V90 Cross Country. You might have fun tossing the Allroad around on a dirt trail, but when it comes to truly difficult off-road terrain, you'll want something with a bit more ground clearance. And because of all the off-road oriented equipment, the Allroad is significantly less fun to drive on a curvy back road than the standard A6. Powerful turbocharged V6 acceleration is always there to make it exciting on the highway, and its understated, classy looks always make it feel upscale, but the A6 Allroad isn't as exciting or as practical as we'd like.",V6 cylinder ,200," 369 lb-ft @ 1,370 ",, 7-speed automated manual

A new instrument panel, center console with cupholders, interior trim and upgraded stereo has been added, and a tilt steering column is now standard on all Durangos. The 5.2-liter V8 engine is dropped, leaving the more efficient 4.7-liter V8 as standard equipment in both 4x2 and 4x4 Durangos. A variable-delay intermittent rear wiper is offered, and auto-dimming, heated outside power mirrors can be had on in SLT trim. A new appearance option group for the SLT includes 16-inch aluminum wheels, along with special body side moldings, running boards and lower panels. New 15-inch Sparkle Silver aluminum wheels are standard across the Durango lineup. A serious SUV, down to its stout towing ability, generous cargo room, unyielding ride and abysmal fuel economy. The Durango is Dodge's fierce competitor in the sport-utility market. Eighty percent of its parts are shared with the Dakota, including the platform, but the Durango's frame is actually three times stiffer than the pickup's. Unfortunately, the rough ride doesn't let you forget its truck origins. It's somewhat bouncy, and you'll be aware of the added stiffness, yet it's not miserable enough to hamper the Durango's cushy-cruiser status. The Durango may be compact on the outside, but once inside you'll be shocked by the roominess. With a 7,600-pound towing capacity and 88 cubic feet of maximum cargo space, it's an SUV that can be stuffed to the gills with family and friends, and still have the ability to haul your watercraft or other form of weekend fun. However, you'll have to make a choice - eight people, or useable interior cargo space, because you can't have the best of both worlds when there's a full house. Thankfully, a standard roof rack further expands your cargo carrying options. If you are taking advantage of the third row, you'll appreciate the ease of the fold-and-tumble forward second-row seating and the improved-for-2001 climate control system with separate second and third-row air conditioning outlets. Legroom is notable throughout, but larger folk may want to avoid the third row for anything other than short jaunts. Headroom shouldn't be an issue, thanks to the raised roofline. The interior underwent a major revamp for 2001. A new instrument panel, a Homelink transmitter (available in Overhead Convenience Group), a redesigned floor console and new seat patterns give the Durango's cabin a thoroughly modern look. Also new this year are power lumbar supports, a power passenger seat, heated leather seats with two-level temperature control, and three new colors -- Sandstone, Dark Slate Grey, and Taupe. The improved climate control system offers dual-zone front temperature controls and has a greater heating/cooling capacity.Durangos come in either 4x2 or 4x4 configurations. Both versions come standard with the modern 4.7-liter Magnum V8, a sprightly engine, requiring less-frequent fill-ups than with the optional 5.9-liter eight-pot, though the best choice for towing is the optional V8. Performance aficionados will want to consider the Durango R/T with its 5.9-liter engine, shorter rear axle ratio, 17-inch wheels, sport-tuned exhaust, and stiffer suspension as an alternative to mundane minivans.Off-road, Durango is a capable, if somewhat oversized, wilderness runner, able to tackle a wide range of obstacles. The Durango also shines as a grocery-getter and soccer-team hauler. Steering is commendably responsive and overall build quality is up to par for this vehicle segment, though we'd like to see higher-grade interior materials used in certain areas. Emphasis for this vehicle is on utility and style. The Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ford Explorer are rivals, but none of them have bolted in a third row of seats, yet (Explorer gets them in 2002), so the Durango still has the advantage in terms of passenger capacity. Also, a fully equipped SLT Plus comes in under $34,000 (and remember, that's for a V8, four-wheel drive, and leather seats), making it a budget-conscious splurge. If Dodge could address the Durango's poor gas mileage and mediocre crash test scores, this would be the clear choice for those seeking maximum utility in a user-friendly size.",V8 cylinder ,200," 295 lb-ft @ 3,200 ",, 4-speed automatic 
Bmw,bmw 3-series,2011,,,"['Limited interior storage space, compromised rear headroom, options can inflate price quickly.']",4.2,"The 3 Series coupe and convertible have been slightly restyled for 2011, and have been given an additional model in the form of the more sport-oriented 335is. All 335i models receive a new, more fuel-efficient turbocharged engine. The upgraded stereo is also once again branded as a Harman Kardon. Even entering the sixth year of its present generation, the 2011 BMW 3 Series remains the best entry-level luxury sedan you can buy. They say that variety is the spice of life. If that's true,  the 2011 BMW 3 Series can make things hotter than a habanero. You can get a  sedan, a wagon, a coupe and a convertible; there are two turbocharged six-cylinders,  a wickedly torquey diesel engine and a regular six-cylinder that's hardly a  slouch. Then there are more add-ons to be had than ornaments for a Christmas  tree. Yep, there's really something for everyone, which partly explains why the  3 Series has been so popular for so long. Oh, and the fact that it's one of the  finest automobiles on the globe may have something to do with it, too.
Now in its sixth year since the last full redesign, the BMW 3  Series soldiers on with key changes for 2011. The coupe and convertible get a  mild styling refresh that only the keen eyes of Bimmerphiles will notice. More  important, though, is an all-new engine for the 335i models. Its output remains  the same, but the switch to a single twin-scroll turbocharger in place of the  old engine's dual single-scroll turbochargers combines with direct injection to  improve fuel economy. Not only is the new 335i thriftier than the old one, it  sips slightly less fuel than the 328i.
The old twin-turbo inline-6 lives on, however, in the new  335is coupe and convertible. This sport-tuned version produces 320 horsepower and  332 pound-feet of torque, with an overboost function that can briefly bump torque  up to 370 lb-ft. We're guessing that the 335is will hit 60 mph in just a hair  under 5 seconds. In many ways bridging the gap between 335i and M3, the 335is  also features a sport-tuned suspension and exhaust, an aerodynamic body kit,  sport seats and a chunkier steering wheel.
Otherwise, the 3 Series remains one of the most desirable  vehicles on the road. Quite simply, no other entry-level luxury model can match  the Bimmer's exquisite combination of athletic handling and premium ride  comfort. Even the base suspension setup is more capable than most, while the  Sport package gives it sports-car-grade cornering capabilities without the  slightest hint of impact harshness. This sophisticated dual nature has often  been imitated, but never duplicated.
Automotive journalists like us often wax poetic about the 3  Series, but there's a reason for that: It's just that good. With the updates  made this year, we see no reason why the 2011 BMW 3 Series should fall from its  perch. Of course, there are worthy rivals and the 3 Series certainly doesn't  provide the most equipment for your buck. The 2011 Audi A4 (and the 2011 Audi S5), 2011 Cadillac CTS, Infiniti  G37 and 2011 Mercedes-Benz  C-Class certainly deserve test-drives. But if you just make a single trip to  the BMW store, we can't say we blame you. The 2011 BMW 3 Series comes standard with rear-wheel drive, but all models but the convertible, 335d and 335is can be equipped with xDrive all-wheel drive.The 328i features a 3.0-liter inline-6 that produces 230  and 200 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed manual is standard and a six-speed automatic is optional. In performance testing, we clocked a 328i sedan with the manual from zero to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds, while the heavier convertible is a few tenths of a second slower. According to the EPA, fuel economy is an estimated 18 mpg city/28 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined. The wagon and/or all-wheel-drive models are a smidge worse.The 335i features a 3.0-liter turbocharged inline-6 that produces 300  and 300 lb-ft of torque. It gets the same transmission choices as the 328i. Although this engine is new, its power numbers are the same as before, so we doubt its 0-60 times would be much different than the approximate 5-plus-second times we recorded in the past. Fuel economy is now actually slightly better than the less powerful 328i, at 19 mpg city/28 mpg highway and 22 mpg combined.The 335is features a more powerful version of the 335i's previous twin-turbocharged inline-6, and produces 320  and 332 lb-ft of torque. There is a temporary overboost function, however, which bumps torque up to 370 lb-ft. A six-speed manual is standard, and a seven-speed automated dual-clutch manual known as DCT is optional. The 335is should be even quicker than the 335i. BMW's estimated fuel economy is 18/26/21 with the manual and 17/24/19 with DCT.The 335d has a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged diesel inline-6 that produces 265  and a massive 425 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic is standard. In performance testing, we clocked the 335d from zero to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds. Its EPA-estimated fuel economy is 23/36/27. Standard safety equipment on the 2011 BMW 3 Series includes antilock disc brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. The convertible lacks the side curtains, but the regular front side airbags extend up to head level and there are also pop-up rollover hoops. The stability control system integrates several features designed to improve braking performance, such as periodically wiping the brake rotors dry when the windshield wipers are in use and automatically snugging the pads to the rotors when the driver abruptly lifts off the throttle. BMW Assist Emergency telematics are optional.In government crash tests, the sedan and wagon received four out of five stars for frontal collision protection and five stars for side protection. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the 3 Series the top rating of ""Good"" in its frontal-offset crash test. The 3 Series also scored a ""Good"" for side crash protection except for the convertible, which received the second-lowest ""Marginal"" score. Driving is what the 2011 BMW 3 Series does best. The 328i's naturally aspirated inline-6 is otherworldly in its smoothness from idle to redline, and it has enough power to suit most tastes. Those in search of something more will be well served by the 335i, which maintains the 328i's refinement while adding a huge wallop of turbo torque that's always on tap. This year's new 335is doesn't feel much different from the regular 335i until you floor the throttle, at which point the overboost function provides a noticeable uptick in acceleration. For maximum mpg, the 335d is the car to get, and it serves up face-flattening torque off the line, too.The 3 Series' sublime suspension, steering and brakes will provide endless, easily accessible entertainment. Sport package-equipped models can even keep pace with many genuine sports cars. At the same time, the 3 Series is a wonderful long-distance cruiser, boasting both a supple ride and a hushed cabin. The 3 Series' long-running double act is truly extraordinary: It speaks the language of driving enthusiasts, yet its upscale image and comfortable interior give it unrivaled mass appeal. The 2011 BMW 3 Series interiors will be familiar to anyone who has spent time in a BMW product. Classic analog gauges, sensible ergonomics and a restrained overall aesthetic combine to create a pleasant driving environment, though there's less visual pizzazz here than in some rivals.The base seats are comfortable and supportive, while the Sport package's purpose-built seats are even more so. Materials and build quality are exceptional; even the standard leatherette (vinyl) upholstery looks and feels better than one would expect. The convertible's available heat-reflective leather does a wonderful job of keeping occupants' posteriors cool. The recently improved iDrive electronics interface that comes with the optional navigation system is intuitive and one of the best interfaces of its kind.The rear seats are adequately roomy for adults on shorter trips, but taller passengers will complain that their heads are crammed into the roof. Trunk space is average in sedans and coupes, while the wagon offers a maximum cargo capacity of 61 cubic feet. The convertible offers a reasonable cargo hold when the hardtop is up, but predictably shrinks considerably when the top is lowered. Standard equipment on the 328i models includes 16-inch wheels, heated side mirrors, rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights, foglamps, ""leatherette"" premium vinyl upholstery, automatic climate control and a 10-speaker sound system with CD player, HD radio and an auxiliary audio jack. The coupe comes with a sport-tuned suspension, while the convertible gets a power-retractable hardtop, an upgraded stereo and power front seats with driver memory. Both two-door 328i's get 17-inch wheels and adaptive xenon headlights.In addition to their different engines, the 335i and 335d add 17-inch wheels, adaptive xenon headlights (sedan and wagon), a sunroof (not convertible) and power front seats with driver memory. The 335is coupe and convertible get a more powerful engine, a sport-tuned suspension, 18-inch wheels, a special body kit, sport seats and a sport steering wheel.The Premium package adds leather upholstery (heat-reflective in the convertible), auto-dimming mirrors, Bluetooth connectivity, BMW Assist telematics and, on 328i models, a sunroof and power seats with driver memory. The Sport package (all but 335is) specifies the sport-tuned suspension for convertibles, sedans and wagons (the coupe already has this as standard) and all get larger wheels, the sport seats and steering wheel, and special ""Shadowline"" exterior trim. The M Sport package adds many of the 335is features.The Cold Weather package adds heated front seats, retractable headlight washers and fold-down rear seats (though the latter are unavailable in the convertible). The Convenience package adds adaptive xenon headlights (328i), front and rear parking sensors, power rear sunshade (not convertible or wagon), keyless ignition/entry and manual side window shades (sedan and wagon).Most of the upper trim and package add-ons are also available as à la carte options. Other items include a hard-drive-based navigation system with the iDrive controller, active cruise control, an active steering system (335i and 335is only), a heated steering wheel, paddle shifters for the optional automatic transmission, satellite radio, an iPod adapter and a Harman Kardon surround-sound audio system.",,52," 200 lb-ft @ 2,750 ",, 6-speed manual 
Honda,honda civic,2000,honda civic 2000,"['Roomier than many cars in this class, agreeable levels of comfort in any trim level, powerful Si engine.']","[""Antilock brakes should be available on more than one trim level, styling won't set you apart from the crowd.""]",4.7,"No styling, content or trim changes for the 2000 Honda Civic. The performance-oriented Si continues for 2000, and there have been paint comings and goings: Taffeta White has been added to the CX and DX Hatchback, and Dark Amethyst has been dropped; Titanium Metallic comes to the DX, LX and EX Sedan, and Vogue Silver is gone. Vintage Plum is now available to the LX and EX Sedan, and Inza Red has been eliminated. Though a redesigned Civic comes out next year, excellent value has made the 2000 Honda Civic one of the most popular economy cars in America. More than two decades ago, Honda introduced the Civic. It was a small, anonymous, unassuming car, competing in a market saturated by mammoth sedans sporting ornate chrome, garish styling treatments and acres of sheet metal. The producers of these defunct dinosaurs didn't bat an eye at Honda's fuel-sipping entry, despite the fuel crisis of 1973. Big mistake. Since then, Americans have seen six generations of the Civic come and go, each much improved over the previous model, and each becoming immensely popular with consumers. 1996 brought us a new generation; certainly improved but not so much so that we'd consider it revolutionary. Available in hatchback, sedan and coupe body styles, Honda heeded customers who claimed the 1992-1995 Civic was too sporty-looking. A grille was tacked on up front, sheet metal contours provide a squarish profile, and larger rear taillamps give the Civic a more conservative look.Dual airbags are part of the package, with antilock brakes standard on EX Sedan and Coupe models equipped with an automatic transmission. HX Coupes remain the only model to have available the continuously variable transmission, making it the most technologically interesting Civic offered. Three different versions of a 1.6-liter, SOHC four-cylinder aluminum engine are available on the Civic. The most common variety has an output of 106 horsepower at 6,200 rpm. EX models get 127 VTEC-inspired horsepower at 6,600 rpm, and the HX Coupe uses an economical VTEC-E engine with 115 horsepower at 6,300 rpm. The Si Coupe sports a DOHC four-cylinder that makes 160 horsepower at 7,000 rpm.The Civic has few shortcomings, aside from its anonymous personality. Hondas tend to be on the expensive end of the scale when new, but over time, they are a far better value than most of their contemporaries. The Civic is no exception to the rule. It is a car for people who don't enjoy repair-shop waiting rooms. It is a car that holds its resale value better than most of the cars it competes with. It is a car that easily endears itself to its owner. The Civic is a solid buy. For those who like a bit of fun in their commute, try the Si version of the coupe. Want a fuel miser? The HX Coupe is your car, getting up to 44 mpg. Strict budgets demand a look at the CX, while sedans are aimed more at the creature-comfort side of the scale. Style-conscious buyers will go for the svelte coupe, or the suave EX Sedan. Whatever your needs, Honda offers a Civic that will meet them -- unless your needs include towing trailers or carrying a family of five.",Inline 4 cylinder ,290," 103 lb-ft @ 4,600 ",, 5-speed manual

That's certainly the case with the Audi e-tron Sportback, which  boasts a smooth ride, impeccable cabin materials and plenty of premium features  among its positive attributes. This Sportback is the sporty-looking version of  the regular all-electric e-tron SUV. Its sloping rear roofline adds style, but  you sacrifice a little cargo space and rear headroom in the process. 
Audi  is further enhancing the e-tron Sportback's appeal for 2022 with a new  performance-oriented e-tron S Sportback. The e-tron S has an additional motor,  bringing the total to three for this all-wheel-drive SUV. Combined output is  429 horsepower, which can be temporarily increased to 496 . Audi estimates  that the e-tron S Sportback can sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds using  launch control. (The standard 355- model does 0-60 mph in as little as 5.5  seconds.) 
If  you're tired of being smoked by Teslas at a freeway on-ramp, the e-tron S  Sportback might justify its considerable price increase over the regular  e-tron. But there's still the issue of the e-tron's range, which falls short of  expectations with just 212 miles on a full charge, according to the EPA. And  that's with the stock 20-inch wheels. Get the bigger 22-inch wheels and range  drops to 185 miles. We like the e-tron S Sportback, but we also suggest  checking out the new BMW iX, which is similarly powerful and luxurious but has  considerably more range.  A  case can be made for any e-tron trim, but the Premium Plus is the sensible choice if you're getting an S. You get  a few extra features with the Prestige, but we don't think it's worth spending  more to get them.",,208,,, 1-speed direct drive 
Jeep,jeep wrangler,2001,jeep wrangler 2001,"['Cheap, fun to drive, classic styling, go-anywhere capability.']","['Soft top can be tricky to operate, difficult entry/egress, slow steering, limited storage space.']",4.5,"The 2001 Jeep Wrangler gets a number of improvements. All models benefit from a new four-ply soft top that reduces wind and road noise at speed. Deep tint windows are now standard on the Sahara hardtop and optional on Sport and SE models with the solid-shell roof. Two new center console designs are available on all models, as is a premium subwoofer. The add-a-trunk feature and removable side steps have been redesigned to improve functionality, and a new instrument cluster, low-pivot steering column, rearview mirror, airbag cutoff switch, child seat-tether anchors, and multifunction headlight/wiper stalk are standard across the entire model line. The ABS system is upgraded; intermittent windshield wipers are now standard, and the 4.0-liter inline six now meets LEV requirements in all 50 states. Sienna Pearl Coat, Amber Fire and Steel Blue exterior colors have been added, while Medium Fern Green and Desert Sand have been dropped. It has a stiff ride, offers about the same noise isolation as a motorcycle and has a soft top that's a nail-buster to operate. That said, the 2001 Jeep Wrangler also offers a visceral motoring experience like no other and the off-road ability of a mountain goat. The Wrangler continues to be the quintessential off-road icon. This Jeep began as a vehicle for military use and has retained its Spartan utility while slowly evolving into a practical and popular means of transportation. The Wrangler has never lost its drive-me-hard-through-the-slop origins, despite improvements for enjoyable daily commuting. And it's one of the cheapest convertibles around. Available in SE, Sport and Sahara trim levels, the Wrangler fits into several budgets. Our favorite model is the Sport, with a gutsy 4.0-liter inline-six engine that makes 190 horsepower and 235 maximum foot-pounds of torque. It can be hooked to either the standard five-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission and comes equipped with an AM/FM/cassette stereo and a carpeted cargo area. The SE is for people who don't mind a lack of power (a 2.5-liter inline four with only 120 horsepower is all she wrote at this level) and no ABS. The Sahara is the priciest of the bunch, and while it gets you the same 4.0-liter engine as the Sport, the Sahara?s air conditioning, leather-wrapped steering wheel, front and rear tow hooks, fog lamps, AM/FM/CD stereo, Convenience Group (with lockable storage, and dual cupholders), and Heavy-Duty Electrical Group are among its official features. Nobody, however, will mistake the Wrangler for a smooth-running family sedan; it's very much a truck, thanks to its high step-in height, slow steering ratio and abundant wind and road noise (though the new-for-2001 four-ply soft top helps reduce aural irritants). On the street, its petite size and tight turning radius make it a blast to maneuver, but it can get a little scary to drive and control at freeway speeds in severely high winds. Its performance off-road is unparalleled. The Wrangler's Quadra-Coil suspension allows for incredible amounts of wheel articulation, resulting in steep approach and departure angles. And the abundance of aftermarket parts to modify the Wrangler makes it enormously popular with the rock-crawling crowd. The Wrangler does have its quirks -- rear visibility can be a challenge, and taking off and putting on the soft top requires superhuman levels of patience. Once the top is on, be prepared for obtrusive flapping. Ordering the Sahara with the Dual Top Group option gets you a hardtop with tinted glass and a folding/removable soft top for a multitude of configurations -- though transitioning from one to another can be a daunting task. Despite the top's packaging flaws and Wrangler's raw-edged nature, this Jeep is fun to drive, cheap, and a terrific multipurpose tool.",Inline 4 cylinder ,168," 140 lb-ft @ 3,500 ",, 5-speed manual

Chevrolet,chevrolet tahoe,2011,chevrolet tahoe 2011,"['Comfortable ride', 'smooth powertrains', 'good fit and finish', 'can seat as many as nine', 'stout towing capability.']",,4.5,"The 2011 Chevrolet Tahoe gains an integrated trailer-brake controller with the optional Trailering package. The 2011 Chevy Tahoe is a leading choice for a traditional large SUV thanks to its comfortable cabin and ability to haul and tow. But for pure passenger use, a large crossover SUV might work out better. The 2011 Chevrolet Tahoe continues much as before, and that,  no doubt, is just fine with a sizable number of folks who've grown to appreciate  its mix of truck toughness and surprisingly refined practicality.
Like the Chevrolet Suburban to which it's related, the  Tahoe is a do-anything, go-anywhere sport-utility vehicle. Its truck-based architecture  and strong V8 engine allow it to tow heavy loads, and the available four-wheel-drive  system can take you off-road or through the snow. These aren't necessarily activities  that are undertaken every day, but only a vehicle with big-truck capability can  deliver when the time comes. And yet when it comes to everyday use, the Tahoe's  relatively comfortable ride and its well-executed cabin with three rows of  seats make it a practical choice. In the era of the crossover, few vehicles  offer such a combination.
Within its segment, the Chevy Tahoe compares well to the 2011 Ford Expedition and 2011 Toyota Sequoia.  The Expedition offers a third-row seat that conveniently folds away to expand  cargo capacity, yet the Ford isn't as powerful as the Tahoe. The Sequoia is the  Tahoe's most serious competitor; it offers a similar mix of performance and  utility. We'll also point out that if pure passenger use is more important than  toting and towing, a large crossover SUV is a better pick. The 2011 Chevrolet Traverse and its GM siblings as well as the 2011 Ford Flex and 2011 Lincoln MKT offer  better on-road handling, superior fuel economy and more flexible interior  arrangements. Every 2011 Chevrolet Tahoe is equipped with a 5.3-liter V8 generating 320 horsepower and 335 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission transmits power through the rear wheels on 2WD models or all four wheels on 4WD models. The 4WD Tahoe is offered with a choice of either a traditional two-speed transfer case or a single-speed unit without low-range gearing. 
The Tahoe's acceleration is strong for a full-size SUV, as the 4WD Tahoe hit 60 mph in about 8.5 seconds in Edmunds testing. EPA-estimated fuel economy is respectable, with 15 mpg city/21 mpg highway and 17 mpg combined. A properly equipped Tahoe can tow up to 8,500 pounds. The 2011 Chevy Tahoe comes standard with antilock brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and OnStar emergency telematics. Rear parking sensors and a rearview camera are available on every Tahoe, while the Tahoe LTZ can be had with a blind-spot warning system.
In Edmunds brake testing, a Tahoe came to a stop from 60 mph in 134 feet, an average distance for a vehicle in this class. In government crash testing, the Tahoe received the top five-star rating for both frontal and side-impact protection. Considering the 2011 Chevrolet Tahoe weighs more than 3 tons when a few average-size passengers are aboard, its acceleration is downright energetic. It gets kudos for its towing ability, too. If you need an SUV to pull a large boat or trailer, the Tahoe will serve you well up to its rated capacity.
It's also adept as a highway cruiser, swallowing up the miles with a compliant and cushioned ride. There's a penalty to be paid, however: lackadaisical steering response and somewhat disconnected handling dynamics as speeds increase. The Tahoe's tight 39-foot turning circle does make it reasonably maneuverable in town.  The Chevrolet Tahoe's cabin is one of its strengths, with an attractive design and high-quality fit and finish. The layout of its controls is straightforward, and their operation intuitive. The front seats are comfortable, though the lack of a telescoping steering wheel might be a drawback for some drivers.
One of the Tahoe's advantages over its competition is the ability to accommodate nine occupants with the LS's available front split bench seat. However, the Tahoe lacks a convenient flat-foldaway third-row seat; the rear seats are heavy, awkward to remove and must be stored elsewhere. Once the seats are out, there are 109 cubic feet of cargo capacity. 
The base Tahoe LS comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, tri-zone manual climate control, eight-passenger seating with front power-adjustable bucket seats and center floor console, a 60/40-split second-row seat and 50/50-split removable third-row seat. Also standard are Bluetooth, OnStar and a six-speaker audio system with CD and rear audio controls, satellite radio, an auxiliary input jack and an iPod/USB interface. An optional Convenience package includes power-adjustable pedals, remote engine start, rear parking assist and a rearview camera system with mirror display. A front split bench seat may be substituted to enable nine-passenger seating. 4WD models include a single-speed transfer case.
LT models include most available LS equipment plus front foglamps, a locking rear differential, tri-zone automatic climate control, eight-passenger leather-trimmed seating and nine-speaker Bose audio. Among options not available on the LS are second-row captain's chairs (for seven-passenger seating) and a Luxury package with heated front and second-row seats (with power release), power-folding mirrors and a power rear liftgate. An optional Z71 Off-Road package adds specially tuned springs and shocks, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-terrain tires, skid plates and unique front and rear fascias.

Honda,honda civic,1996,honda civic 1996,,,4.6,"Honda engineers have created a more powerful and more contemporary car with the 1996 Honda Civic. More than two decades ago, Honda introduced the Civic,  It was an small, anonymous, unassuming car, competing in a market saturated by mammoth sedans sporting ornate chrome, garish styling treatments, and acres of sheetmetal.  The producers of these defunct dinosaurs didn't bat an eye at Honda's fuel sipping entry, despite the fuel crisis of 1973.  Big mistake.Since then, Americans have seen four generations of the Civic come and go, each much improved over the previous model, and each becoming immensely popular with consumers.  1996 brings a new generation; certainly improved by not so much so that we'd consider it revolutionary.  The 1996 Civic isn't much smaller than an Accord.  Available in hatchback, sedan and coupe body styles, Honda has heeded customers who claimed the 1992-1995 Civic was too sporty looking.  A grille has been tacked on up front, sheetmetal contours provide a squarish profile, and larger rear taillamps give the Civic a more conservative look.  Sedans, coupes and hatchbacks have been given more individualistic styling themes, with the hatchback retaining honors as most odd among the trio.Dual airbags are part of the package, with antilock brakes standard on EX models and available on LX  sedans.  Our press kit says the Civic is equipped with ""variable diameter tubular door reinforcing beams.""  We take this to mean that the Civic passes next year's tough side impact standards.  HX coupes are available with a new continuously variable transmission.  Hatchbacks ditch the two-piece clamshell hatch from last year in favor of a more conventional one-piece arrangement.The Civic has few shortcomings, aside from its anonymous personality.  Hondas tend to be on the expensive end of the scale when new, but over time, they are a far better value than most of their contemporaries.  The Civic is no exception to the rule.  It is a car for people who don't enjoy repair garage waiting rooms.  It is a car that holds its resale value better than most of the cars it competes with.  It is a car that easily endears itself to its owner.We think the Civic is a solid buy.  For those who like a bit of spice in their commute, try the EX version of the coupe.  Want a fuel miser?  The HX coupe is your car.  Strict budgets demand a look at the CX, while sedans are aimed more at the creature comfort side of the scale.  Style-conscious buyers will go for the svelte coupe, or the suave EX sedan.  Whatever your needs, Honda offers a Civic that will meet them.",Inline 4 cylinder ,300," 103 lb-ft @ 4,600 ",, 5-speed manual 
Honda,honda passport,1998,honda passport 1998,['Silky V-6 engine. Stylish interior. Rugged exterior. Roomy rear seat.'],['The Isuzu Rodeo looks better'],4,"Like its Isuzu Rodeo counterpart, the Passport has been completely revised from top to bottom.  The Passport gets modernized styling, a user-friendly interior, more powerful  V6 and added room for passengers and cargo. Choices in the sub-$30,000 sport-utility class are numerous. Figuring out which truck best meets your needs almost always requires a compromise of some sort or another. The closest thing to perfect has been the Ford Explorer, and spectacular sales of this popular SUV prove that buyers find its combination of room, style and power the best in the segment.The Explorer is a fine sport-ute, but there's a new face in this neighborhood that deserves consideration. Meet the all-new Honda Passport, which has been completely re-designed.  The new look is familiar yet contemporary and the 1998 Passport is one of the more ruggedly handsome SUVs available today.Inside, a new interior provides cupholders, excellent ergonomics, the industry's most perfectly designed steering wheel, comfortable seats front and rear and plastic trim that looks anything but.  Clamber aboard and head for the hills; it's easy with push-button 4WD and standard antilock brakes to thwart nature's attempts to impede your progress.Buyers get a unique hatchgate, which employs flip-up glass and tailgate that swings from right to left. The full-size spare tire can be stored under the vehicle or on the hatchgate. LX and EX trim levels are available. The basic Passport has two-wheel drive and a powerful 3.2-liter six-cylinder engine, with 205 horsepower to whisk you along with verve. EX models are loaded with standard equipment.Problems with the new design are minimal. The location of the push-button 4WD switch is absurd, located directly next to the cruise control button where it could be activated accidentally. Off-road, the new Passport feels somewhat undersprung, but takes bumps and dips easily if speeds are kept down. Finally, there are no rear cupholders for the kiddies.The new Passport is an excellent blend of old-fashioned truck toughness and modern day car-like convenience. If you're looking for a new $30,000 SUV, this one should be near the top of your shopping list.",V6 cylinder ,116," 214 lb-ft @ 3,000 ",, 5-speed manual 
Chevrolet,chevrolet tahoe,1997,chevrolet tahoe 1997,"['Near perfect size, powerful V8 engine, standard ABS, dual airbags']","['Price, fuel economy']",4.2,"A passenger-side airbag is added, and the automatic transmission is improved.  Variable steering debuts, and cargo areas have a power door lock switch.  A new center console comes with high-back bucket seats, and two new paint colors are available. Compact sport-utility vehicles get most of the attention nowadays, but for folks with big families--or scads of goods to lug around--they're just not spacious enough inside.  Chevrolet offers a solution to this problem with the Tahoe, based on the full-size C/K pickup platform but garageable in either two- or four-door body styles.At a glance, the four-door Tahoe and larger Suburban look nearly identical, but a Tahoe measures 20 inches shorter.  Beneath the hood sits a Vortec 5700 V8, rated 255 horsepower.  Two-door Tahoes with LS or LT trim can be equipped with a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 instead of the Vortec 5700.From the driver's seat forward, Tahoes are virtually identical to Chevy's full-size pickups.  Space is massive up front.  Capable of towing as much as 7,000 pounds, four-door Tahoes seat either five or six, and an underbody-mounted spare tire helps boost cargo space.On the Interstate, the Tahoe rides nicely, but the wide body takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to compacts.  Turning onto smaller roads, it suddenly feels more like a truck.  Easy to control either way, this sizable machine is reasonably maneuverable, if driven with discretion.  The V8 is strong, and the four-speed automatic transmission shifts neatly.Think about the ""entry assist"" running boards if your regular riders aren't so nimble.  They help.  So do the robust grab bars that ease entry into the rear seats.  Rear cargo doors are standard, but a lift glass version is available.New for 1997 is a passenger-side airbag, allowing the Tahoe to match Ford's Expedition in safety features.  A new Electronic Variable Orifice steering unit reduces effort in low-speed maneuvering.  The automatic transmission is refined for 1997, featuring smoother shifts and increased efficiency.  Want to lock the Tahoe after unloading cargo?  Now it's easy, with the addition of a power door lock switch in the cargo area.  Order high-back bucket seats, and you'll get a new center console that includes a pivoting writing surface, cassette storage, removable coin holder, dual cupholders for rear passengers, and a latched rear storage drawer.  Rounding out the improvements for 1997 are two new exterior colors:  Medium Opal Blue Metallic and Medium Beige Mystique Metallic.Because Chevrolet targets customers with an income of $85,000 a year, luxury conveniences are part of upscale Tahoe packages.  The typical prospect is an upscale 40-year-old man who currently drives a Chevy Blazer and is attracted to a vehicle's size and power.  Those attributes, the Tahoe has in abundance, as does its little-different GMC Yukon counterpart.With the introduction of the Ford Expedition, Chevrolet loses its dominance of the full-size SUV market.  Further complicating matters, the Tahoe is based on a decade-old platform, while the slightly larger, slightly less expensive Expedition is derived from all-new F-Series underpinnings.  We recommend investigating the Expedition, unless you're a dyed-in-the-wool Chevy fan.",V8 cylinder ,140," 330 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",, 4-speed automatic

Models ordered with the Quick Order package now have gray-painted bumpers and overfenders, and Toyota has added color-keyed bumpers and overfenders to the ""L"" package. There are also three new L package colors: Rainforest Pearl, Spectra Blue Mica and Pearl White (Natural White and Vintage Gold have been discontinued). A solid and pleasing package, if a tad bit small. Back in 1996, the term ""cute-ute"" was coined when Toyota released the RAV4, an acronym for Recreational Activity Vehicle with 4WD. While Suzuki had been plying these waters for years with the Sidekick (and its Chevy Tracker twin), it wasn't until the car-based RAV hit the market that small SUVs became popular.The latest RAV4 was redesigned just last year. Available as a five-door wagon only, it has a refined new look thanks to sharply upswept headlights and crisp lines that stretch the length of the vehicle. Squint hard enough, and Toyota's new mini-ute could even pass for a poor man's BMW X5, sans the neck-snapping V8, of course.Powering the RAV4 is a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 148 horsepower at 6,000 and 142 pound-feet of torque at 4,000 rpm, a significant improvement over its predecessor, but still far below the 200 horsepower offered in the Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute. Buyers can choose between a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission driving the front or all wheels.Standard equipment is sparse, with most of the good stuff like antilock brakes, aluminum wheels, air conditioning, remote keyless entry and a power sunroof optional. An option package bundles power windows, doors and locks with air conditioning, cruise control and a six-speaker sound system with both cassette and CD players. Upgrade to the ""L"" package and you get these goodies plus heated exterior mirrors, floor mats, dark tinted glass, foglights and special exterior trim. The ""L"" package is also your ticket to leather upholstery. A limited-slip differential is a stand-alone option on 4WD versions.Even with 4WD, the RAV4 isn't meant for serious off-road excursions. Where the RAV4 really shines is on the pavement, where its taut suspension, quick steering, and tight turning radius come together to produce one of the best-handling SUVs we've ever driven. Minimal body lean and sticky street tires combined with the traction of 4WD provide reassuring handling in almost all situations.The passenger cabin is another area where the redesigned RAV scores points. Simple and straightforward climate controls are a snap to use, and the radio is placed nice and high for quick access. Other thoughtful design elements include adjustable cupholders and well-placed storage bins. There's plenty of room for four passengers, but throw in a fifth and things get a little tight.Toyota rarely skimps when it comes to safety features, and the RAV4 is no exception. Dual front airbags are standard along with ALR/ELR seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force-limiters. Side airbags aren't available, but the RAV4 has faired well in government crash tests. One item of note is the RAV4's lack of a rear bumper. Low-speed crashes that damage the rear of the vehicle can lead to extremely high repair costs.Overall, we find Toyota's latest RAV4 to be a fun-to-drive sport-utility that makes a terrific urban runabout. The smooth-revving engine can be noisy, but it returns high fuel mileage, and the precise suspension tuning transmits a confident feeling of control at all times. If these are traits that appeal to you, by all means, give the RAV4 serious consideration.",Inline 4 cylinder ,382," 142 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",, 5-speed manual 
Toyota,toyota avalon,1997,toyota avalon 1997,"['Toyota reliability, powerful V-6 engine, fit and finish']","['Snoozeville, but still more enticing than, say, a Buick LeSabre']",4.7,"More power, more torque and added standard features make the Avalon one of the most appealing full-size sedans With the Avalon, Toyota takes on a traditionally Detroit-dominated section of the marketplace: the full-size sedan.  The last assault Toyota made on a domestic market was in 1993, when the T100 pickup was introduced as an alternative to big trucks from Ford, GM and Dodge.  The 1994 Dodge Ram and the lack of a V8 in the Toyota conspired to keep sales to a minimum.  We think the company has learned something from its experience with the T100.For instance, the Avalon's V6 is a powerful motor, allowing the Avalon to keep up with GM front-drivers like the LeSabre and Bonneville in acceleration, and besting the V8-powered Crown Victoria in the race to 60 mph.  Handling is on par with the Bonneville SSE, and braking is outstanding.  But see, this wasn't enough for Toyota, so this year they bumped power and torque output and gave the XL standard antilock brakes.  How 'bout working some of this type of magic on other Toyotas like the Tercel, Corolla, and Celica, huh guys?Other news for 1997 includes a radio antenna embedded in the rear window and freshly styled alloy wheels.  Exterior mirrors are now heated, glass is of the high solar energy absorbing type, and when you punch the remote keyless entry fob, the Avalon ""visually confirms"" that it received the message, according to Toyota press materials.Inside, the Avalon is noticeably more narrow than the domestic competition, but six will fit in a pinch when equipped with the optional bench seat.  The rear seat is exceptionally comfortable, offering more leg and foot room than bigger sedans, with good support and a high seating position.Front seats are comfy as well, and face an ergonomically designed dashboard that places everything right where you expect to find it.  This car reeks of quality construction and materials inside and out.  The styling is generic, with oversize headlights and a narrow grille imparting an out-of-balance appearance to the front end.Overall, the Avalon impresses us as an excellent alternative to aging, and aesthetically impaired, offerings from GM and Ford.

The CR-V is available with antilock brakes. For years, Honda has been selling a sport-utility vehicle that many consider a fraud.  Forget that the Honda Passport is based on the very rugged and capable Isuzu Rodeo, to Honda aficionados it is not a real Honda.  (Think of how the Porsche 914 fares in the eyes of diehard Porsche fanatics.)  Thus, to many people, the CR-V is the first Honda sport-utility vehicle.Built on the Civic platform, the CR-V successfully integrates familiar Honda components into an all-new design.  Honda's famous four-wheel double-wishbone suspension makes an appearance on the CR-V, the first ever application of four-wheel double-wishbone technology on a sport-ute, as does the very familiar four-speed automatic transmission.  The 2.0-liter DOHC inline four-cylinder engine makes 126-horsepower and 133 ft-lbs. of torque.  The CR-V's real time four-wheel drive system is a derivative of the unit that Honda initially offered on their Civic wagon.  The result of using all of these car components is that the CR-V looks and feels rather like, um, a car.The CR-V's interior is instantly recognizable to anyone who has spent any time in Honda's passenger cars.  Functionality takes precedence over style in the CR-V's cabin, and the result is easy-to-read gauges, well-placed controls, and high-quality, if somewhat boring, interior materials.  Fit and finish is equal to the highly-acclaimed Accord.  The CR-V offers comfortable chairs for its occupants, each of which has excellent visibility and the ability to recline when the trip grows long.  The CR-V's cargo capacity is an outstanding 67.2 cubic feet when the rear seats are folded. Available in only one trim-level, the CR-V is surprisingly well-equipped.  Air conditioning with a micron filtration system is standard, as are power windows, power door locks, rear window wiper and defogger, AM/FM stereo, and a folding picnic table that doubles as a cargo area cover.  Options include antilock brakes and alloy wheels.The CR-V is not meant to replace hard-core recreational vehicles like the Jeep Wrangler or Toyota 4Runner.  Instead, it is meant for the person who wants the functionality of a sport utility without having to pay an exorbitant sticker price and huge gas bills.  The CR-V will get people to work and back in all but the worst weather, and to their favorite picnic area, assuming it's not on the Rubicon Trail.

A continuously variable transmission (CVT) is available on front-wheel-drive models with this engine. Other mechanical changes this year include stronger brakes, an improved stability control system and BrakeAssist. OnStar telematics makes its way onto the options list, and you'll be pleased to find a standard six-disc changer in the dashboard. Styling in and around the car, such as the head and taillamps, is slightly modified and new interior and exterior colors expand your choices. The A6 is a worthy competitor in the luxury sedan class, particularly if you're more into a comfortable, luxurious ride than a sporty one. Several flavors of the A6 are available for 2002. A new standard 3.0-liter V6, found in the base sedan and Avant, brews up 220 horsepower and is mated to a standard Tiptronic automatic, a continuously variable transmission (CVT) for non-quattro models or an optional five-speed manual transmission. Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system is optional on the 3.0 and standard on all of the remaining models. This system constantly monitors the grip at all four tires. When one of them starts to lose traction, the quattro system automatically applies power to the tires with the most adhesion to the road surface. As extra precaution, Audi's Electronic Stability Program (ESP), standard on the sedans and optional on the 3.0 Avant, applies brakes to the misbehaving wheel and gently points you back on your course. The A6 2.7T Sedan has a twin-turbo 2.7-liter V6 that produces 250 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. Audi has used two small turbos rather than one large one to make the engine more responsive. In a nice tip of the hat to enthusiasts, the 2.7T comes with a six-speed manual transmission as standard equipment. A five-speed Tiptronic-controlled automatic transmission is a no-cost option.The Audi A6 4.2 Sedan features the V8 normally found in the larger A8 Sedan. Obviously, this is Audi's challenge to the V8-powered BMW 540i and Mercedes-Benz E430. The 4.2-liter engine produces 300 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, channeled through a five-speed Tiptronic-controlled automatic transmission. Beyond the engine, the 4.2 also comes with more aggressive styling, bigger wheels and tires and more standard equipment. All A6 models feature a sublime interior that is one of the best in its class. Audi greets drivers with a generous amount of supple materials and features. As a bonus, A6 buyers can choose from three different types of interiors. The atmospheres -- Ambition, Ambiente and Advance -- differ in their use of texture and appearance of the seat upholstery, and the color and type of genuine wood and aluminum trim. New for 2002 is a standard in-dash six-disc changer.The A6's styling is unmistakably Audi, with a swept greenhouse and muscular fenders. The Avant station wagon is a good fit for this silhouette, and offers 36.4 cubic feet of cargo space; 73.2 cubic feet are available with the seats down. So why did you need that SUV?The A6 is an enticing choice in the hotly contested luxury sedan class. If you're looking for a wagon, the A6 Avant should serve nicely. Our personal favorite is the A6 2.7T. This version offers better acceleration than the 3.0 and nearly equals the 4.2.

A theft-deterrent system is standard, and three new colors debut. For the first time in 25 years, Chevy dealers received a brand new, completely re-designed, full-size van to sell in 1996.  The Chevy Van (the cargo hauler) and the Express Van (the people hauler) come equipped with powerful optional engines, lots of cargo space, dual airbags and four-wheel anti-lock brakes.  With this modern new design, Chevrolet is stealing some of Ford's thunder in the full-size van market.Converters prefer rugged full-frame construction, because it allows for improved stability, ride and handling.  Since most full-size vans are bought for conversion into rolling motel rooms, the new van employs this type of platform.  Regular-length models carry 267 cubic feet of cargo, and extended-length vans can haul 317 cubic feet of stuff.  Trick rear doors open 180 degrees to make loading and unloading the  van easier.  Up to 15 passengers can ride in the extended-length Express, making it perfect for use as an airport shuttle.  Other seating options include five-, eight- and twelve-passenger arrangements.  G3500s can tow up to 10,000 pounds when properly equipped.For convenience, the full-size spare is stored underneath the cargo floor.  A 31-gallon fuel tank keeps this thirsty vehicle from frequent fill-ups, but topping off an empty tank will quickly empty your wallet.  Engine choices are sourced from the Chevrolet family of Vortec gasoline motors, and a turbocharged  diesel can be installed in under the hood.  Available are the Vortec 4300 V6, the 5000, 5700, and 7400 V8s, and a 6.5-liter Turbo-diesel V8.  Standard side cargo doors are a 60/40 panel arrangement, but a traditional slider is a no-cost option on 135-inch wheelbase vans.Child safety locks are standard on the rear and side doors of the Express.  Assist handles help passengers into and out of the van.  Front and rear air conditioning is optional.  For 1998, all vans have a standard theft deterrent system, and Express models get new seat belt comfort guides.  Airbags switch to a new mini-module design.Exterior styling is an interesting mix of corporate Chevrolet and Astro Van, with cues lifted from the defunct Lumina Minivan.  The high, pillar-mounted taillights are odd, but functional.  They can easily be seen if the van is operated with the rear doors open.  Low-mounted bumpers and moldings make the Express look taller than it is.  An attractively sculpted body side gives the van's smooth, slab-sided flanks a dose of character.  Three new colors arrive for 1998, in shades of gray, blue and copper.Overall, Chevrolet's thoughtful rendition of the traditional full-size van appears to be right on target, giving Ford's Econoline/Club Wagon the first real competition it has faced in years.",V6 cylinder ,322," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Midsize sport-utility vehicles get most of the attention nowadays, but for folks with big families (or scads of goods to lug around) they're just not spacious enough inside. GMC offers a solution in the form of the Yukon, a full-size four-door sport-utility with enough room to handle just about anything a family could need.Offered in either standard SLE guise or new top-of-the-line Denali trim, the Yukon can be equipped with two- or four-wheel drive. Standard models come well stocked with power everything, a premium audio system, full instrumentation, remote keyless entry, cruise control, power-adjustable front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and numerous storage bins spread throughout the spacious cabin. Luxury-oriented Denali models add full leather upholstery, wood trim, Bose audio, chrome wheels, heated front seats, rear audio controls and the OnStar communications system just to name a few. All Yukons are powered by a 5.7-liter Vortec V8 rated at 255 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque, while a four-speed automatic transmission handles the shifting. Standard SLE models with four-wheel drive use a dual-range push button transfer case while the Denali offers AutoTrac 4WD that engages only when needed. The truck-derived suspension uses torsion bars up front and leaf springs in back for maximum durability and towing stability. Two-wheel-drive Yukons can tow up to 7,000 pounds. On the interstate, the Yukon rides nicely, but the wide body takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to smaller midsize vehicles. The steering isn't a strong point as it's vague and unresponsive, but once you get used to the large turning radius it doesn't feel quite so overwhelming. Visibility is excellent as is passenger room, but if you need maximum cargo space better to upgrade to the slightly larger, but nearly identical Suburban. There's enough usable power from the V8 for towing average-size boats but don't expect sizzling acceleration.Whether you choose the standard SLE or the high-line Denali, either Yukon is a solid choice for families who want the added room of a full-size but don't want to give up the upscale amenities that many smaller SUVs provide.

Refinement is exchanged for low car payments.'],3.6,"The 1999 Malibu is identical to the 1998 model, except for the addition of Medium Bronzemist Metallic to the paint chart. Chevrolet is producing good cars and trucks.  Witness the excellent values to be found in the Blazer, Camaro, Cavalier and Lumina.  The Malibu is more of a good thing.  In fact, this is probably the best family car produced by any domestic automaker today.Consumer clinics determined much of the Malibu's design.  Engineers used a nearly identical methodology when concocting the recipe for the successful Lumina.  What consumers have demanded is a tight, solid, roomy, fun-to-drive mid-sized sedan.  Guess what?  Chevrolet delivers, and delivers big.  The Malibu is all of these things and more, wrapped in unobtrusive but attractive sheetmetal and sold at a price that undercuts similarly equipped imports and domestics, including stablemate Lumina.Two models are available.  The base Malibu features a 2.4-liter twin-cam four-cylinder engine, which is the same motor found under the hood of the Cavalier Z24.  Gears are shifted automatically, and standard equipment includes four-wheel antilock brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, battery rundown protection, theft deterrent system, tachometer, air conditioning, rear seat heat ducts, tilt steering wheel and remote trunk release.  Step up to LS trim, and you leave the showroom in a fully loaded car.  The LS includes a 3.1-liter V6 engine, aluminum wheels, fog lights, remote keyless entry, power driver's seat, power windows and door locks, cruise control, uplevel stereo and a trunk cargo net.This Chevy goes, slows and turns corners well enough to be entertaining.  Interior design elements include a handy left-handed cupholder, backlighting for major controls and switches throughout the interior and heating and air conditioning ducts located on the A-pillar to help direct air flow to rear seat passengers.  Also notable is the dash-mounted ignition switch because the driver doesn't have to crane his neck around to find the ignition slot.Safety concerns are covered by the Malibu.  Dual airbags, four-wheel antilock brakes and child safe rear door locks are standard.  According to Chevrolet, side-impact door beams exceed federal standards for protection, though federal side-impact crash tests indicate that occupants may actually be rather vulnerable in this car.  Maintaining the Malibu has been made easy with platinum-tipped spark plugs that last 100,000 miles, engine coolant designed to last five years or 150,000 miles and transmission fluid that never has to be changed or checked.Our list of gripes is short.

Additional features are ladled onto the standard equipment list. The generously equipped Sonata could be just the car to save you from life in a stripped Accord or Camry. And it comes with a super warranty. The Sonata is a thoughtfully designed family sedan that makes for a viable alternative to the more expensive and popular Honda Accord and Toyota Camry. Under the hood of base models is a standard 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine making 150 horsepower and 156 foot-pounds of torque. Buyers can upgrade to a more powerful V6 or get it standard if they spring for GLS trim. This V6 is an aluminum 2.5-liter DOHC motor making 170 horsepower at 6,000 and 167 foot-pounds of torque that peak at 4,000, which means power off the line can be a bit lacking. Sonatas can be ordered with automatic or manual transmissions mated to either engine. Higher in the rev range, the V6 can get clamorous, and the Sonata's automatic transmission can be easily befuddled, causing occasionally hard shifts. The Sonata offers decent steering feedback, and body roll is kept to a minimum. Road and wind noise are adequately muffled, and the brakes stop the car with confidence. Riding on a front double-wishbone suspension and a rear five-link setup, the Sonata's ride and handling can be characterized as stable, smooth and responsive. Inside the monochromatic cabin are plush seats, an adequate driving position and a nice-looking dashboard. Drivers will also find well laid-out radio and climate controls, a nifty penholder and a leather shift knob on the GLS model. The trunk is spacious with an extremely low lift-in height for ease of use, and rear seats on the GLS fold down conveniently in a 60/40 configuration to expand the cargo area.Standard safety features such as side airbags, seatbelt pre-tensioners and a passenger-presence airbag detection system all contribute to a safer environment in the Sonata. Optional ABS is offered.Hyundai has one big advantage over most other manufacturers peddling bread-and-butter sedans these days. Aptly called the Hyundai Advantage, the company's warranty program is a great incentive to buy a Hyundai over one of the many other choices on the market. With the purchase of any Hyundai vehicle, consumers will receive an awesome 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty, 5-year/100,000-mile corrosion coverage and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty for 5 years or 60,000 miles. Roadside assistance is part of the deal, too, for 5 years and unlimited mileage. Incorporating dependability and cutting-edge style in affordable packaging, Hyundai has come a long way lately, and the Sonata is proof of it. Desirable, safe and well equipped, Sonata is perfect for hauling the family around town. If you're still not convinced that the Sonata could lure you away from that bare-bones Camry, Accord or Passat you've been salivating over, go drive one.

Horsepower jumps from 120 to 125. The Corolla also achieves low emission vehicle status this year. Reliable but bland, the 2000 Toyota Corolla is a conservative pick in the economy sedan class. The Toyota Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it one of the best-selling vehicles in the history of automobiles.Now while that's neat and all, we're sure that what's really important to you and your wallet is whether the modern Corolla still has what it takes to stomp out its competitors. The current Corolla platform was introduced in 1998. In those two short years, the Dodge Neon, Ford Focus, Mazda Protege, and Volkswagen Golf have all been substantially redesigned or newly introduced.To fend them off, the Corolla comes equipped with a 1.8-liter, all-aluminum, DOHC four-cylinder engine that cranks out 125 horsepower. This is five more than last year, thanks to a variable valve timing and lift system that Toyota calls VVT-i. VVT-i employs continuously variable intake valve timing to provide greater engine performance, better fuel economy and reduced pollution over a wide range of rpm.With the exception of minimal legroom for both the driver and passengers, the Corolla's interior ergonomics are flawless. Toyota also managed to pack a multitude of interior storage compartments into the Corolla, including a small pullout drawer in the dash and a large bin under the HVAC controls. There is very little road noise and the Corolla handles quite well for a compact sedan.The Corolla is one of the best compact sedans on the market. Few competitors (with the exception of Honda) can match Toyota's run-forever reputation and high levels of build quality. But the Corolla will certainly have its work cut out for it in 2000. Equipped with options most customers are expecting these days (such as ABS, CD player, and cruise control), the price of a Corolla can quickly jump to more than $18,000.

It began with the original 1986 M3 that BMW  built to satisfy the production-car homologation rules of a German race car  series. Enthusiast buyers loved it, and have ever since. Flash-forward some 35  years and we've arrived at the redesigned 2021 BMW M3. Based on the latest 3  Series sedan that came out for 2019, this new M3 fits the more recent M3 theme:  It's a practical daily driver with plenty of performance capability to support  recreational track use. 
Powering  the standard M3 is a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder. This new  engine is similar to the previous M3's engine but has been given a thorough  overhaul. It produces 473 horsepower, which is a bump of 48  over the  previous model. Stepping up to the M3 Competition increases output to 503 .  BMW puts the 0-60 mph time for the standard M3 at 4.1 seconds —  likely a few ticks slower if you opt for the manual — and 0-60 mph in  3.8 seconds for the Competition. 
Put your foot in it and the M3 becomes  ridiculously rapid. Big speeds just ambush you. Any significant right-ankle  extension has you riding ahead on a colossal wave of torque. There's heroic grip when going  around turns too. Unfortunately, the steering doesn't provide as much feel for  the road as we'd expect from a performance car like this. 
And  yet this new M3 is a major upgrade over the old one. It's outrageously fast,  yet it also inspires confidence when approaching its limits and gives you  plenty of sedan-based practicality. But competition is tight in this class. The  Audi RS 5 Sportback and Mercedes-AMG C 63 are similarly capable, and Cadillac  is back in the small performance sedan business with its CT4-V Blackwing. The  M3 easily holds its own here, but you should also take a few test drives to see  which high-performance four-door suits you best.  If  you still prefer your cars with manual transmissions, the base M3 is the only  way to go. For everyone else, we suggest opting for the M3 Competition. It's only available with an automatic transmission,  but it gets a bump in power and a wider array of options than the standard car  for a relatively small jump in price. Either way, we suggest opting for the  M3's Executive package.",Inline 6 cylinder ,605," 406 lb-ft @ 2,650 ",rear wheel drive , 6-speed manual 
Acura,acura tlx,2015,acura tlx 2015,"['Quiet interior', 'good fuel economy ratings', 'sporty handling, particularly with all-wheel drive', 'plenty of features for the money.']","['Touchscreen has so-so graphics and a distracting interface', 'underwhelming acceleration', 'subpar braking performance.']",3.7,"The 2015 Acura TLX is an all-new model. The 2015 Acura TLX faces the unenviable task of replacing not one, but two, of Acura's most popular sedans. But with a more appealing middle-ground size and upticks in performance and luxury, the TLX is now a closer match to its competition. If the TLX name sounds vaguely familiar, that's because it  is. Acura has removed the compact TSX and  the midsize TL sedans from its lineup and combined them into one all-new  vehicle, the 2015 Acura TLX. Size-wise, the TLX is longer than the TSX but  shorter than the TL and, as such, is better suited to appeal to entry-level  luxury sedan shoppers. 
Thankfully, the TLX has inherited many of the attributes  from its forebears. Acura gives you a choice of two updated engines -- either the  TSX's four-cylinder or the TL's V6 -- and both offer enhanced fuel economy  thanks in part to new eight- and nine-speed automatic transmissions. As was the  case with the TL, all-wheel drive is available with the V6 and it's again  utilized to provide both enhanced traction in inclement weather and sportier  handling.
The TLX also gives you a nice mix of luxury and sport. The roomy  and impressively quiet cabin is a comfortable place to spend your commuting  hours, and it comes with plenty of high-tech equipment as standard. Away from  the highway, the TLX is enjoyable to drive. It feels nimble around turns, and  all TLXs come with shift paddles to give you direct control of those new  transmissions.
Of course, combine two cars and there's bound to be a little  collateral damage. The four-cylinder engine, while certainly capable enough,  can't match the stronger punch provided by turbocharged four-cylinders found in  many competing models. The TL also features Acura's latest dual-screen  electronics interface, but we've found its functionality leaves a little to be  desired. And while the TLX is impressively well rounded, it can come off as a  little bland compared to the more lavish or customizable designs of some  rivals.
This might be the case should you check out the all-stars of  the segment, the 2015 BMW 3  Series and 2015  Mercedes-Benz C-Class. The 3 Series continues to offer an excellent mix of  sporting performance and luxury, while the redesigned C-Class sets new levels  for interior opulence. Other great picks to think about include the 2015 Audi A4, 2015 Lexus IS and 2015 Volvo S60. Yet  if you do some research you'll no doubt discover that these cars often end up  costing thousands more when comparably equipped to the TLX. So if you factor in  that value along with its sporty driving demeanor and everyday comfort, the Edmunds.com  ""B"" rated 2015 Acura TLX is definitely an entry-level luxury  sedan you'll want to check out. The 2015 Acura TLX gives you a choice of two engines: a  2.4-liter four-cylinder and a 3.5-liter V6. The 2.4-liter engine generates 206  horsepower and 182 pound-feet of torque. It's offered only with front-wheel  drive and is paired with a specialized eight-speed automated manual  transmission. (It's an automated dual-clutch manual, much like's VW's DSG or  Porsche's PDK, but Acura has also fitted a conventional automatic's torque  converter to it for claimed smoother operation at slow speeds.) 
During Edmunds testing, a TLX 2.4 accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.4  seconds, which is on the slow side for this segment. EPA  estimated fuel economy with the 2.4-liter engine is 28 mpg combined (24 city/35 highway), which is very good for this class of car. On our  mixed-driving evaluation route, however, we observed 23.6 mpg, which is lower  than what we've obtained from some turbocharged competitors.
As for the 3.5-liter V6, it's rated at 290  and 267 lb-ft  of torque with a nine-speed automatic transmission. The V6 is offered with  either front-wheel or all-wheel drive.
At the test track, a TLX 3.5 with all-wheel drive sprinted to 60 mph in 6.4  seconds. That's generally fairly brisk, if still nearly a second off the  segment speedsters. Fuel economy is an EPA estimated 25 mpg combined (21/34) with front-wheel drive. Interestingly, going with all-wheel drive still  gets you 25 mpg  combined (21/31). Our observed fuel economy was again disappointing,  though, checking in at 21.2 on our evaluation route. Standard safety features on the 2015 Acura TLX include  antilock disc brakes, stability control and traction control, a rearview  camera, front seat side airbags, side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag and  active front head restraints.
During testing of both a TLX 2.4 and TLX 3.5, we recorded identical  stopping distances from 60 mph of 129 feet, which is about 7 feet longer than  average for this segment.
Optional safety equipment includes front and rear parking  sensors, a blind-spot warning system, lane-departure warning, lane-keeping  assist, forward collision warning and automatic braking for frontal collision mitigation.
During Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests,  the 2015 Acura TLX was given the highest possible rating of  ""Good"" for moderate-overlap frontal-offset collisions, side  impacts, roof strength and seatbelt and head restraint design for whiplash  protection in rear impacts. In the small-overlap frontal-offset collision test,  the TLX received the second highest rating of ""Acceptable"" from the  IIHS.  For the 2015 Acura TLX, one of your first decisions will be  which powertrain configuration to get. The four-cylinder delivers excellent  fuel economy, and its power is certainly adequate for everyday use. Selecting  the transmission's ""Sport +"" mode notably perks up performance, as  downshifts come swiftly and lower gears are held longer, thus keeping the  engine in the sweet spot of its power band. Still, almost all other rival base  engines in this class are turbocharged, making the TLX's performance seem a  little underwhelming if you drive them back to back. If you've got the need for  speed, the V6 is certainly the way to go.
The TLX is lighter than the TL it replaces and you can feel  that weight difference in the way it drives. There's an enjoyable combination  of everyday comfort and sporty back-roads prowess here that should meet your  desires for a luxury sport sedan. The steering doesn't have a lot of feel, but the  TLX still goes around turns with an unexpected level of nimbleness. This is  true of both the front-drive models (thanks to their rear-wheel steering  feature) and all-wheel-drive TLXs that can apply engine torque to individual  wheels to help the car quickly power out of turns. 
However, regardless of which TLX you drive, the chassis'  athletic abilities are let down during more spirited driving by their tires'  relatively meager levels of outright grip. In terms of ride quality, over  rutted city streets the TLX's suspension can seem a little stiff (though far  from objectionable), but on the highway it's controlled and smooth-riding. The TLX's interior is a step up compared to the TSX and TL. The  front seats in the TLX have thick yet soft padding and decent lateral support to  provide high levels of comfort. The rear seat is quite plush, too, with a  comfortable seatback angle. Rear-seat headroom will be a bit tight for tall  adults, though legroom is generous for this segment. Acura says it employed  extensive noise-cancelling measures in the TLX. The latter seem to have worked,  as very little wind and road noise makes its way into the cabin, which makes  for easy conversation.
The interior's overall look is clean and similar to Acura's  flagship RLX sedan and MDX crossover. The gauges are easy to read and the stacked  display screen combo is used to show and control most of the car's functions. The  learning curve for this interface is pretty painless but some of the  touchscreen controls are tedious to use and the overall graphic resolution is  underwhelming. And while overall interior quality is certainly nice, a few of  the trim pieces aren't quite as rich-looking or -feeling as what you'll find in  an A4 or C-Class, for instance.
Trunk space, at 13.2 cubic feet, is average for this class. 
For standard equipment, the base TLX gets 17-inch alloy  wheels, all-wheel steering, LED headlights and brake lights, a sunroof, heated  side mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic climate control,  vinyl (leatherette) upholstery, heated front seats, an eight-way power driver  seat (with power lumbar), a four-way power front passenger seat (eight-way on  V6), 60/40-split-folding rear seatbacks, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel  and an auto-dimming rearview mirror.

Audi's A4 is sleek, sophisticated, speedy and has won praise from the worldwide automotive media. Small and safe, the A4 has scored well in government crash testing. For U.S. buyers, this translates into a competent alternative to the BMW 3 Series, the Acura TL and the Volvo S40/V40, among others. For 2000, four versions are available: the A4 1.8T Sedan and 1.8T Avant Wagon, and the A4 2.8 Sedan and 2.8 Avant Wagon. The numerical designations refer to engine size. 1.8T models get a 1.8-liter turbocharged engine that produces 150 horsepower and 155 foot-pounds of torque. Vehicles with a 2.8 designation have a 2.8-liter V6 filling their engine bays. The six-cylinder makes 190 horsepower and 207 foot-pounds of torque. Both engines can be ordered with a five-speed manual or a five-speed Tiptronic automanual transmission. Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard on Avant wagons and optional on the sedans. Besides engine selection, the 1.8T vehicles differ from the 2.8 vehicles in only minor trim. The 2.8 Sedan and Avant have bigger wheels and tires, 10-way power seats, aluminum trim on the window frames, and wood interior decor. All cars feature goodies like automatic climate control, remote keyless entry, heated outside mirrors and windshield-wiper nozzles, an eight-speaker CD audio system, and 60/40 split folding rear seats. Avant wagons have 31.3 cubic feet of cargo room with the rear seat up and 63.7 cubic feet of cargo room with the seat folded down. They also come with a retractable rear luggage cover, a luggage net, and a three-point center seatbelt. Tether anchors for a child seat are now standard. Audi buyers can also personalize their cars by choosing from three different interior themes: Ambition, Ambiente and Advance.

Optional features include a Bose premium sound system, a six-disc CD changer, a navigation system sport seats and, new for 2000, xenon HID headlights. Dual front airbags, side-impact airbags for front passengers and antilock brakes come standard. Head curtain airbags for front and rear passengers are optional for 2000. All A4s enjoy free scheduled maintenance for three years, as well as three-year/50,000-mile basic warranty coverage.

Of course, BMW enthusiasts will argue that we are missing the boat, but we really have no idea who is supposed to buy this vehicle.  The distinguishing feature of the BMW 8-Series is a noticeable lack of intent, a definite aberration in the standard order of BMW vehicle design.  Initially developed as a luxury sports coupe, the 8-Series is now wallowing in a schizophrenic never-never land.  Is the car sporty?

Roomy, quick and loaded with features for a low price, it's tough to go wrong with the too-often overlooked Malibu. Chevrolet is trying to claw its way back from mediocrity. Witness the excellent values to be found in the Blazer, Camaro and Cavalier. The Malibu is more of a good thing. In fact, this is one of the best family cars produced by any domestic automaker today. Consumer clinics determined much of the Malibu's design. What consumers have demanded is a tight, solid, roomy, fun-to-drive midsize sedan. Guess what? Chevrolet delivers, and delivers big with this car. The Malibu is all of these things and more, wrapped in unobtrusive yet attractive sheetmetal and sold at a price that undercuts similarly equipped imports and domestics. Two models are available. Both Malibus feature the torquey 3100, 3.1-liter V6 engine, making 170 horsepower and 190 foot-pounds of torque, while meeting low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards. Gears are shifted automatically, and standard equipment includes four-wheel antilock brakes, four-wheel independent suspension, battery rundown protection, theft deterrent system, tachometer, air-conditioning, rear-seat heat ducts, tilt steering wheel and remote trunk release. Step up to LS trim and you leave the showroom in a fully loaded car. The LS includes aluminum wheels, fog lights, remote keyless entry, power driver's seat, power windows and door locks, cruise control, uplevel stereo, and a trunk cargo net. This Chevy goes, slows and turns corners well enough to be entertaining, particularly with last year's boost in power. Interior design elements include a handy, left-handed cupholder (which is really too shallow for drinks and should be relegated to use as a change holder), backlighting for major controls and switches throughout the interior, and heating and air conditioning ducts located on the A-pillar to help direct air flow to rear-seat passengers. Also notable is the retro-style, dash-mounted ignition switch, because the driver doesn't have to crane his neck around to find the key slot. Malibu has safety concerns covered, too. Dual airbags, four-wheel antilock brakes and child-safe rear door locks are standard. According to Chevrolet, side-impact door beams exceed federal standards for protection, though federal side-impact crash tests indicate that occupants may actually be rather vulnerable in this car. Maintaining the Malibu has been made easy with platinum-tipped spark plugs that last up to 100,000 miles, engine coolant designed to last five years or 150,000 miles, and transmission fluid that never has to be changed or checked. Our list of gripes is short. The fake wood in the LS is unnecessary. We also want to find an integrated child safety seat on the options list in the future. And why can buyers get traction control on the Cavalier but not the Malibu? The list of improvements for 2001 doesn't address our concerns, though automatic on/off headlamps have been added and new cloth seats and door panels grace the interiors.

Choices when it comes to full-size vans are easy to make. Do you want a Dodge, a Ford or one of the Chevy/GMC twins? If the Express offers the package you need in a full-size van, then buy it. Chevy's brawny Express van comes equipped with a cavernous interior and a variety of powerful engines, like most full-size vans. But with the Express' modern design and body-on-frame construction, Chevrolet is stealing some of Ford's thunder in this narrow but lucrative market.Because many full-size vans are bought for conversion into rolling motel rooms, engineers put the Chevy Express on a full-frame platform for improved stability. Regular-length models carry 267 cubic feet of cargo, and extended-length vans can haul 317 cubic feet of stuff. Trick rear doors open 180 degrees to make loading and unloading easier. Standard side cargo doors are a 60/40 panel arrangement, but a traditional slider is a no-cost option on 135-inch wheelbase vans. Up to 15 passengers can ride in the extended-length version, making it perfect for use as an airport shuttle. Other seating options include five-, eight- and 12-passenger arrangements. G3500s can tow up to 10,000 pounds when properly equipped.A 31-gallon fuel tank keeps this thirsty vehicle from frequent fill-ups, but topping off an empty tank will quickly empty your wallet. An 8.1-liter V8 is the most powerful gasoline engine available providing a class-leading 340 horsepower and 455 pound-feet of torque. Other powerplants include the 4300 V6, 5000 and 5700 gasoline V8s, and a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8. All G1500 and G2500 models get GM's 4L60-E four-speed transmission, while heavier-duty G3500s use a stronger 4L80-E shifter. ABS brakes are standard equipment on all Express vans.  The upscale LT trim level gives Express buyers a luxury-level option that includes leather seating, an optional Bose sound system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer with dual flip-down monitors connected to a VCR and game system. Base and LS models still offer standard safety features like child safety locks on the rear and side doors and handy assist handles to help folks climb in and out. Base Express vans include front air conditioning (front and rear air conditioning is optional), vinyl seats, AM/FM stereo, antilock brakes and daytime running lights. The LS adds cloth upholstery, power windows and locks, cruise control and tilt wheel.Exterior styling is an interesting mix of corporate Chevrolet, Astro Van and old Lumina minivan. We'll admit the high rear pillar-mounted taillights are odd looking, but at least they're functional. They can be seen easily even if the van is operated with the rear doors open. Low-mounted bumpers and moldings make the Chevy Express look much taller than it is. An attractively sculpted body side gives the van's smooth, slab-sided flanks a dose of character, as does the quad-lamp grille arrangement.

Hyundai,hyundai accent,2006,hyundai accent 2006,"['Ample acceleration, smooth ride, stable handling, attractive interior, comfortable seats front and rear, standard front side and side curtain airbags, generous warranty.']","[""Cruise control isn't available, a few plastics look cheap.""]",4.8,"The Hyundai Accent sedan has been completely redesigned for 2006. It's now roomier and more refined and comes with a features list topped by a spunky 110- engine and standard ABS and side curtain airbags. No longer a downmarket penalty box, the 2006 Hyundai Accent is pleasant to drive, comfortable and loaded with features -- at a bargain price. Introduced in 1995, the Hyundai Accent surprised people with its solid construction and decent equipment list for a vehicle positioned at the bottom end of the economy car segment. Between its unrefined road manners and lack of amenities, however, it was basic transportation and nothing else. Hyundai redesigned the Accent for the 2000 model year, and our experience showed that this car, too, was a decent buy for those seeking basic transportation.A restyle in 2003 resulted in a more modern-looking exterior, but with fierce competition looming, namely Scion's xA and the upcoming Toyota Yaris, Hyundai knew a major redo was necessary. Although the 2006 Accent may not have the Scion's fashion sense, it's pleasant to drive, loaded with features and comfortable to boot. Of significant note, all Accents now come standard with four-wheel antilock disc brakes, side-impact airbags for front passengers and full-length side curtain airbags, items that you typically have to pay extra for, even on larger, more expensive sedans. The new Accent is also larger by a few inches all around. The result is 104.6 cubic feet of interior room, the most for a sedan in its class.Quickness is not within a lower-end economy car's grasp, but energized by a new 110-, 1.6-liter inline four with variable intake valve timing, the Hyundai Accent gets around as easily as any of its peers. As before, suspension consists of a simple arrangement of struts in front and a semi-independent torsion bar with coil springs in back, but Hyundai engineers took more care when tuning it, because it's fully capable of managing body movement and road irregularities. Handling around corners is sure and steady, and the highway ride is smooth and quiet. Of the entry-level economy cars on the market today, the 2006 Hyundai Accent is one of the most likable and offers excellent value. Powered by a new 1.6-liter inline four with variable intake valve timing, the new Accent gets around as easily as any of its peers. Horsepower comes in a 110, while torque rates 106 lb-ft. A five-speed manual transmission is standard, while a four-speed automatic is optional. All major safety features come standard on the 2006 Hyundai Accent, including four-wheel antilock disc brakes, side-impact airbags for front occupants and full-length side curtain airbags. You'll find adjustable head restraints and three-point seatbelts, and the front seatbelts feature pre-tensioners and load limiters as well. The 1.6-liter engine provides decent low-end pull, and a strong midrange allows the Accent to merge into highway traffic with ease, although the engine gets noisy at higher rpm. Shifting the manual gearbox is enjoyable, thanks to the distinct gates and forgiving clutch. Acceleration is just as good with the automatic, which serves up smooth upshifts and on-time downshifts. The Accent's ride is smooth and stable, as the suspension does a fine job of soaking up road irregularities. Pushed through corners, the Hyundai Accent responds with predictable body roll and nicely weighted steering. The Accent's two-tone cockpit has an airy, optimistic feel so often lacking in this price bracket. Interior materials quality is above average, but a few of the plastics aren't up to the Scion xA's level. The cloth upholstery is attractive and breathes well in warm weather, and the control layout is as straightforward as they come. The headliner is extra thick, which gives this budget sedan a surprisingly quiet ride. Seat comfort is excellent, as the well-shaped front chairs offer a generous range of seat-track travel. In back, headroom and legroom should be ample for all but the tallest adults, and the tall bench provides good thigh support and easy installation for car seats. The Hyundai Accent is available as a four-door sedan in one trim level, GLS. Standard equipment includes 14-inch wheels; cloth interior; a CD player; manual windows, locks and mirrors; a tilt steering wheel, an eight-way adjustable driver seat; and a 60/40 split-folding rear seat. The optional Premium Sport Package provides air conditioning, power windows and door locks, keyless entry with alarm, heated power-adjustable exterior mirrors and 15-inch alloy wheels.

LED headlights are standard this year. Inside, there are minor style and control revisions and a larger display screen for the optional navigation system. The IS 300's formerly optional package of advanced driver aids (Lexus Safety System+) is also now standard. The 2017 Lexus IS 300 is one of the more  aggressively styled luxury compacts, even if performance isn't a primary focus.  But considering its all-wheel drive, well-honed ride, ample features and low  noise levels, it's got enough going for it to be a convincing choice.   The IS 300 is the midgrade model introduced just  last year, slotting in between the turbocharged IS 200t and range-topping IS  350. The IS 300 gets a slightly detuned version of the 350 model's 3.5-liter V6  engine and comes solely with all-wheel drive and a six-speed automatic  transmission. There are some drawbacks, such as lackluster performance and a  lack of storage and rear legroom. But overall we think the IS 300 will appeal to many shoppers looking for  a small luxury sedan.  The 2017 Lexus IS 300 is one of the more aggressively styled small luxury sedans, even if performance isn't a primary focus. But considering its all-wheel drive, comfortable ride, ample features and quiet interior, it's got enough going for it to be a convincing choice. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions,  although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2016 Lexus IS 200t with the F Sport package (turbo 2.0L inline-4 | 8-speed automatic | RWD). The 2017 Lexus IS 300 produces slightly more power and is  all-wheel-drive, but our finds remain broadly applicable. This IS is generally not as quick as the class equivalents. Lexus says to expect a 0-60 mph time of 6.1 seconds for the IS 300. That's decent, but many rival sedans with six-cylinder upgrade engines are quicker still. The brake pedal travel is surprisingly short and stiff for a Lexus and lacks a sense of stopping power. In our emergency panic-braking test, an IS 200t with the F Sport package stopped from 60 mph in 117 feet, which is below average for a car on summer-rated tires. The electric steering builds effort that provides a natural and direct response, but it lacks road feel, which is important if your front tires ever lose grip. The IS fails to provide confidence in this area, which is critical for spirited driving or low-grip situations. Even with the stickier optional 18-inch summer tires and sport suspension from the F Sport package, the IS has a tendency to push over the limits of front tire grip. Quick directional changes are more to its liking than long, sustained corners, so choose your back roads accordingly. There's adequate lateral seat support, and the optional ventilation and heating work well. The amount of lumbar support is adjustable, but the position is fixed and sits too high to provide long-distance comfort for an average-size driver. The IS delivers combines solid body control with smooth compliance at all the right times. Bumps and impacts are absorbed without issue, yet there's no hint of a marshmallowy ride or overly soft suspension tune. Very good. Great attention went into the IS 300's cabin soundproofing. Road and wind noise is sufficiently silenced, and you don't hear much of the engine. Quiet cabins are more comfortable and can promote calmer reactions in emergencies. Lexus managed to make the climate controls easy to use while adding cool touch sliders for the temperature adjustment that function flawlessly. The system had no problems maintaining a comfortable cabin temperature, and the optional heated and ventilated seats are stellar. Lexus' haptic joystick interface for the infotainment system is still cumbersome to use and manages to snag USB phone cords with ease. We'd stick to the base system if possible. Even with the easy-entry retracting steering wheel, it's not difficult to graze a knee against the column climbing into the driver seat. The rear door openings are on the smaller side and could prove difficult for less flexible passengers. The cabin space is not abundant in the IS 300. For an average-sized driver, the center tunnel console is needlessly wide and the armrests can feel intrusive. The rear seats have less legroom than in some competitors, and the center seat has marginal headroom. Forward visibility is great, and the rear headrests don't impede the view directly rearward. But huge rear roof pillars and a high body slope create blind spots when reversing. Parking sensors and a rearview camera are optional and recommended. Other than the steering-wheel leather that looks and feels like wrinkled skin by the thumb holds, this interior is done well. The seats have quality stitching, and all contact surfaces are soft with tight panel fit and solid door seals. Storage up front is limited to the armrest bin, the door pockets and the glovebox. At 10.8 cubic feet, cargo space is on the small side for the class. The rear seatbacks fold forward, but hardly flat. The unevenness limits what you can carry with the seats down. There is  only one engine for the IS 300, and  it's the only IS variant that comes standard with all-wheel drive. You might  also want to check out the more powerful IS 350, which can be had with  all-wheel drive, too. As for the IS 300, it's all about the packages. We'd get  the Luxury package, which bundles a  lot of great features, though you can also get many of these features a la  carte. We aren't fans of Lexus' Remote Touch infotainment interface, so we'd  pass on the Navigation package. For music fans, unfortunately, there is no way  to upgrade to the Mark Levinson premium audio system without the navigation  system.  Standard  equipment highlights for the IS 300 includes 17-inch wheels, LED headlights, a  sunroof, keyless entry and ignition, dual-zone automatic climate control,  power-adjustable front seats, premium vinyl upholstery, 60/40-split folding  rear seatbacks, Bluetooth, an 8-inch color display, voice commands and an  eight-speaker sound system. Lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control and  a forward collision warning system with automatic braking are also standard  this year. A number  of packages are available for the IS 300. The smaller ones are the Premium and  Premium Plus packages. The former includes heated and ventilated front seats  and a rearview camera, and the latter adds automatic wipers, a power-adjustable  steering wheel and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. The  Luxury package, which is one we recommend for this IS model, includes all of  the above items plus auto-dimming exterior mirrors, front and rear parking  sensors, leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel rim and driver-seat memory  functions. The  Navigation package replaces the standard infotainment control dial with Lexus'  Remote Touch mouse-type controller and adds a navigation system with a larger  10.3-inch display. A 15-speaker Mark Levinson audio system can be specified,  but it must include the Navigation package. Finally,  there's the F Sport package for those who want to up the sporting factor of  their car. It includes a full-mesh front grille, a revised front bumper,  twin-projector LED headlights, staggered-width 18-inch wheels (with either  summer or all-season tires), a sport-tuned suspension, upgraded brake pads, an  intake sound generator that amplifies engine noise during acceleration, heated  and ventilated front sport seats with enhanced bolstering, perforated leather  trim and a special sport-oriented gauge cluster. Because the IS 300's primary  focus isn't performance, the F Sport package seems a little misplaced here.  A few  other stand-alone options, in addition to some of the above items, include a  power rear sunshade, and remote vehicle control function (door locking and  unlocking, cabin ventilation, vehicle finder, etc.) via a smartphone app  through the Lexus Enform system.",V6 cylinder ,160," 236 lb-ft @ 2,000 ",all wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

The DX trim gets a rear wiper and washer, a cargo cover and a low-fuel warning light. A hot-rod Si model is introduced midyear with a 160- VTEC engine. More than two decades ago, Honda introduced the Civic.  It was a small, anonymous, unassuming car, competing in a market saturated by mammoth sedans sporting ornate chrome, garish styling treatments, and acres of sheetmetal.  The producers of these defunct dinosaurs didn't bat an eye at Honda's fuel sipping entry, despite the fuel crisis of 1973.  Big mistake.Since then, Americans have seen four generations of the Civic come and go, each much improved over the  previous model, and each becoming immensely popular with consumers.  1996 brought us a new generation; certainly improved but not so much so that we'd consider it revolutionary.  Available in hatchback, sedan and coupe body styles, Honda has heeded customers who claimed the 1992-1995 Civic was too sporty looking. A grille was tacked on up front, sheetmetal contours provide a squarish profile, and larger rear taillamps give the Civic a more conservative look.  Sedans, coupes and hatchbacks have been given more individualistic styling themes, with the hatchback retaining honors as most odd among the trio.Dual airbags are part of the package, with antilock brakes standard on EX sedan and coupe models equipped with an automatic transmission.  HX coupes carry through with an available continuously variable transmission, making it the most interesting Civic offered, unless you count the new Si.  Available in coupe format only, the Si is powered by a high-strung 160-horsepower VTEC motor that can sling the Civic to 60-mph in just seven seconds.Four different versions of the 1.6-liter SOHC four-cylinder aluminum engine are available on the Civic.   The most common variety has an output of 106 horsepower at 6,200 rpm.  EX models get 127 VTEC-inspired horsepower at 6,600 rpm, and the HX Coupe uses an economical VTEC-E engine with 115 horsepower at 6,300 rpm.  Si coupes make 160 horsepower at a lofty  7600 rpm.The Civic has few shortcomings, aside from its anonymous personality.  Hondas tend to be on the expensive end of the scale when new, but over time, they are a far better value than most of their contemporaries.  The Civic is no exception to the rule.  It is a car for people who don't enjoy repair shop  waiting rooms.  It is a car that holds its resale value better than most of the cars it competes with.  It  is a car that easily endears itself to its owner.The Civic is a solid buy.  For those who like a bit of spice in their commute, try the EX version of the coupe.  Want a fuel miser?  The HX coupe is your car, getting up to 44 mpg.  Strict budgets demand a look at the CX, while sedans are aimed more at the creature comfort side of the scale.  Style-conscious buyers will go for the svelte coupe, or the suave EX sedan.

A 15-year-old exotic that offers competitive performance. Overpriced for what you get, though. Buy a used one and get virtually the same car with less depreciation. It's hard to believe, but the NSX has been around for 15 years now. Well, that alone isn't hard to believe -- after all, Porsche's 911 has been around for more than four decades. But when you consider that the NSX has made it through those 15 years without a major update or redesign, and that the Civic has been redone three times in the same period, it is a bit of an eye-opener. Except for a horsepower increase and upgrading from a five-speed to a six-speed transmission in 1997, and some styling changes in 2002, the 2005 Acura NSX is essentially the same as the one offered to exotic-car buyers back when the first Bush was president. As such, newer rivals outclass it in horsepower (a Dodge Viper makes 210  more), and it lacks typical luxury features like a stability control system or a navigation system. Even the cabin has a dated '80s look. So, is this a bad thing? Er, well, yes. But this is still an exotic that turns heads everywhere it goes. All-aluminum unibody construction and lightweight aluminum suspension components give the car a nimble feel, despite its large dimensions, and the electrically assisted power steering provides sublime feedback. In terms of handling, the 2005 Acura NSX can run with just about anything. And don't forget that the NSX is part of the Acura (Honda) family, which means it will spend most of its time in your garage instead of the dealer's repair bay. But overall, we don't see much of a reason to purchase a new NSX. For the same money, there are simply better choices, from the Chevrolet Corvette to the Porsche 911. And really, if you desire an NSX, buying a '97-up car will satisfy just as much and save you thousands in the process. The 3.2-liter V6 engine makes 290 horsepower and 224 pound-feet of torque. It's coupled to a close-ratio six-speed manual transmission. A four-speed automatic is also available, but equipping the car as such mandates a smaller 3.0-liter V6 and drops the horsepower rating down to 252. With the six-speed, the NSX can accelerate to 60 mph in about 5 seconds and has a top speed of 175 mph. The NSX lacks some of the more current safety features, such as side airbags or a stability control system. It does have traction control and antilock brakes. Crash testing has not been performed by the NHTSA or the IIHS. Around turns, the 2005 Acura NSX still has the goods to hang with just about any other car sold today. Well-balanced, perfectly poised, easy to drive, powerful, graceful -- the NSX is a precision instrument that is forgiving enough to make drivers of varying skill feel like pros. The midengine design provides excellent weight distribution, keeping the wheels securely planted around turns. Braking and steering are also NSX strong points. There could definitely be more horsepower, though. Spending nearly $90,000 to get 290  doesn't seem quite right. The NSX's cabin is comfortable and refined, and one might even call its styling '80s retro, though we don't think that has anything to do with Acura trying to be hip. All controls are logically placed, the seating position is nothing short of perfect, the targa top is easily stored and visibility is certainly acceptable for a midengine sports car. Optional high-impact interior colors like Vivid Blue and Targa Silver are available to capture the flavor of many aftermarket kits. The two-door 2005 Acura NSX sports car is Acura's most expensive model, but a lack of updates leaves it without the kind of modern amenities you would expect for a car in this price range.

Bmw,bmw 3-series,,bmw 3-series 2023,"['Polished handling', 'Tastefully modern interior with plenty of room', 'Powerful and fuel-efficient engines']",,,"The  seventh-generation BMW 3 Series has been on sale for a few years, which means  it was time for BMW to give it a feature  refresh to keep it competitive against the recently redesigned Mercedes-Benz  C-Class. We knew a styling update would be in the picture for the 2023 BMW 3  Series and feared the beaver-toothed grille from the 4 Series and M3/M4 would  transition to the mild-mannered luxury sedan, too. Thankfully, BMW hasn't  fussed with the exterior too much — the grille is slightly wider than  before, the headlight cluster no longer has the little notch in the middle, and  the front and rear bumpers feature sharper angles, giving it a more modern  look. 
There  are significant changes to the interior, however. For starters, the 12.3-inch  digital instrument panel and central touchscreen now share a singular curved  housing running BMW's latest iDrive 8 software. The new software makes the BMW  Intelligent Personal Assistant smarter, with improved natural language voice  recognition and additional features, including the ability to open and close  the windows or the sunroof through verbal commands. Finally, the central screen  is upgraded to measure 14.9 inches — nearly double the size of the  previously standard 8.8-inch screen — and once again offers touch  functionality. 
BMW  has also streamlined the center stack control layout. There are almost zero  dedicated physical controls for the climate system. Instead, these functions  are moved to the touchscreen in a climate menu, though the driver and passenger  temperatures are always displayed. We're not huge fans of making  attention-sapping touchscreens even more convoluted, but at least you can use  the car's voice recognition system to change the temperature. The useful set of  eight preset buttons, which can be configured for anything from radio stations  to navigation destinations and specific menus, also disappears. Lastly, the  shift lever has been replaced by a toggle switch. 
All  these changes make for a compelling entrant into the compact luxury sedan  segment, but the 3 Series will face stiff competition from the redesigned  Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the stylish Audi A4 and the up-and-coming Genesis G70.  Read on for our thoughts on how the updated 3 Series fares. If  you have a spot to plug it in, the BMW 330e is our recommendation. It's price isn't much higher than the base 3 Series, yet  it comes equipped with a plug-in hybrid powertrain supplying an estimated 23  miles of pure electric driving before switching to gas-electric hybrid  operation. And models manufactured in North America may qualify for a federal tax credit and potentially other incentives  (for new-car buyers); these incentives could actually make it the least  expensive 3 Series.",Inline 6 cylinder ,270," 368 lb-ft @ 1,800 ",all wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

Of the vaunted trio, the 2021 Audi A4 is our favorite. It offers an opulent  interior just like the C-Class and the driving dynamics promised —  but not quite fulfilled — by the latest 3 Series. Even better, it  does this while typically costing thousands of dollars less.  Last  year, Audi updated the A4 with its latest MMI interface that includes a larger  infotainment screen and new touchscreen capability. Audi has included even more  goodies on the 2021 model. The four-cylinder engine has an additional 13  horsepower and includes a 12-volt mild hybrid system. The 12-volt component  should make the engine stop-start system a bit smoother in operation and also  slightly reduces fuel consumption. Audi's Quattro all-wheel-drive powertrain is  now standard equipment, as are lane departure warning and wireless Apple  CarPlay.We  certainly recommend checking out the A4 if you're in the market for a small  luxury sedan. Its numerous strengths, few faults and affordable price tag  — along with Audi's preference for continuous updates — add  up to an appealing package that must be driven to be appreciated. Selecting  a powertrain is easy: The 45 TFSI adds  a lot more power for a reasonable price, so we say start there. As for trim  levels, stick with the base Premium trim  and add the optional Convenience package for the best value.

All grades feature a standard AM/FM/cassette audio system. XLE models add a CD deck and offer an optional in-dash six-disc changer. No more exciting than a toaster, but comes close to being the perfect minivan appliance. Now in its third model year, the Toyota Sienna is one of the top competitors in the minivan market. With the Sienna, Toyota has placed an emphasis on safety, quality, and performance.There are three models: the base CE, the midlevel LE, and the top-level XLE. The CE can be ordered with four or five doors. The LE and XLE come standard with five doors. Under the hood are a standard 3.0-liter V6 and a four-speed automatic transmission. This same powertrain setup can also be found in the Toyota Camry, as the Sienna is built on a stretched and modified Camry platform. In the Sienna, the engine produces 194 horsepower and 209 foot-pounds of torque.This rigid and lightweight unitized body does exceptionally well in government crash testing. Front driver and passenger airbags are standard, though no side airbags are offered. Other safety features include ABS, front seatbelts with pre-tensioners and force limiters, front height-adjustable seatbelt anchors, and daytime running lights. A low tire-pressure warning system is also a standard feature. The ABS wheel-speed sensors measure each wheel's rotational speed relative to the other wheels, allowing the stem to detect low pneumatic pressure in the tires.The Sienna's driving experience is similar to the Camry's in that it's pleasantly non-confrontational. Steering is sure if not quite nimble. The suspension does a good job of soaking up road imperfections, and wind noise is kept to a minimum. Acceleration from the V6 is acceptable for almost all situations.Sienna was designed to offer optimum interior roominess in a compact, easy-to-maneuver package. The interior has a definite Camry feel to it. Removable modular seating allows for custom configurations to accommodate a variety of cargo requirements. Second-row bench seats or captain's chairs and third-row seats can be folded or removed to accommodate bulkier cargo items. Third-row seats also add a 50/50 split-folding and tumble feature for additional cargo space. A power-operated passenger-side sliding door is optional.Overall, Toyota does not make the biggest minivan, but it does make a convenient alternative to either Chrysler-designed family-haulers or the Honda Odyssey. Need to trade in your old Camry to make room for another member of the family? Toyota has a built-in answer to your dilemma.

For 2020, the Audi S7 follows it to market as the  higher-performing alternative. Unlike  the previous-generation S7, which had a burly V8 engine, the new 2020 model  comes with a turbocharged V6 engine. That might seem like a downgrade, but this  new V6 is plenty strong. It's rated at 444 horsepower, which is just 6  fewer  than what the old S7 had, and it makes more torque too. It's also got about 100  more horsepower than regular A7's V6, and it helps the S7 sprint from 0 to 60  mph in an impressively quick 4.5 seconds, according to Audi. Unfortunately,  the new S7 also comes with a new infotainment system that can be distracting to  use while driving. It's also held back for its limited rear-seat headroom, a  byproduct of that gracefully tapering rear roofline. If that's a major concern,  you might be better served by Audi S6, which is virtually identical save for  the roofline. Otherwise, the 2020 S7 provides a very appealing mix of  performance, luxury and style. Since  the 2020 Audi S7's primary mission is performance, we suggest sticking with the  base Premium Plus trim level and add  the optional S Sport package that includes all-wheel steering, a sport exhaust  and a sport rear differential. For convenience, we'd also add the Driver  Assistance package that comes with some useful features, such as  traffic-adaptive cruise control.",V6 cylinder ,265, 443 lb-ft ,all wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

A child safety-seat anchoring system is standard on both the coupe and convertible. New 16-inch wheels and tires are offered as an option on appearance package-equipped V6 Mustangs. The 2000 Mustang also features a tri-color bar emblem on the sides of the front fenders. The original pony car is still one of the best, and there's a good reason for this sport coupe's longevity. Now 36 years old, the Mustang is quickly approaching middle age. Fortunately, it received a facelift and a serious dose of testosterone in 1999. The facelift sharpened the Mustang's looks considerably (some people like it, some people don't). Changes in styling were applied to the doors, hood, decklid, quarter panels, taillights and headlights, rocker panel moldings, side scoops and C-pillar appliques. And even more importantly, both the V6 and V8 engines were modified to produce additional horsepower.Ford's Mustang has outsold the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird for the last five years. This is in spite of the fact that the Mustang has suffered a performance disadvantage since its redesign in 1994. Nevertheless, Ford executives seem to have gotten sick of automotive journalists and gearheads moping about the Mustang's power deficit, so the Blue Oval gang massaged both the 3.8-liter V6 and the 4.6-liter V8, improving power output to more respectable levels. The V6 now makes 190 horsepower at 5,250 and 220 lb-ft of torque at 3,000 rpm. The V8 that's found in the GT's engine bay makes 260 horsepower at 5,250 and 302 lb-ft of torque at 4,000 rpm. If that isn't enough for you, check out the Ford SVT Mustang Cobra. It generates 320 horsepower. We think that part of the Mustang's sales success can be attributed to the car's comfortable interior. Since 1994, the 'Stang has offered drivers and passengers supportive, upright front chairs, well-placed controls, clear views out the front and side windows, and nice dashboard and seat materials. Ford improved the interior as part of the 1999 update. New interior colors and materials were added, and the driver and front-passenger seats were given an additional inch of aft adjustment. For 2000, the Mustang receives two permanent child-safety-seat tether anchors in the backseat. Unfortunately, in neither 1999 nor 2000 did Ford think it necessary to improve the stereo controls. We have always found them to be too small and hard to operate.The Mustang driving experience is enhanced by steering improvements made in 1999. The steering has less kickback and gives the Mustang a tighter turning radius and increased road feel. The rear suspension has more travel than before, smoothing out the bumps that could easily upset the previous model. Ford has also made four-wheel antilock brakes standard on the GT.The Mustang has always been crashworthy, offering drivers and front-seat passengers a high level of protection as rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. All-speed traction control (introduced last year) increases the Mustang's ability to stay out of a wreck, though Ford thoughtfully provides a traction-control defeat switch for the hooligan in all of us.Mustang is one of the most recognizable nameplates on the road. The improved horsepower, updated exterior and revised interior mean that it will likely maintain its spot in the hearts of American buyers. Heck, if the rumors at GM are true about the cancellation of the F-body Camaro and Firebird, this may be the only pony car left for the new millennium.",V6 cylinder ,285," 220 lb-ft @ 2,750 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

The 740iL receives a larger V8 that substantially increases torque. BMW's killer 440-watt sound system is now standard on the 750iL and optional on the 740iL. A sophisticated interior-motion theft-deterrent system is now available. The big Bimmer is barely into its second year of production, and the geniuses at BMW are already finding ways to increase passenger comfort.  The regular wheelbase model has been dropped altogether, and interior comfort has been upped from last year's already impressive cornucopia of features.  The 7-Series successfully competes with the Mercedes S-Class, Jaguar XJ-Series, Lexus LS 400 and Infiniti Q45; offering an amazing degree of performance and opulence in the luxury-car segment.The 750iL enters 1996 with few changes.  Like last year, the only option is metallic paint because these cars come with everything.  Want a stereo that sounds better than symphony hall?  Check.  Want an anti-theft security system that can put Fort Knox to shame?  Check.  Want a heated steering wheel?  Check.  Want 41 inches of rear legroom?  Check.

At $30,000 less than its big brother, the 740iL is geared towards buyers who are merely wealthy instead of obscenely rich.  For 1996, the 740iL receives an increased displacement V8 that BMW claims will launch this 4200-pound vehicle to 60 mph in around seven seconds; thus, making it nearly as fast as a non-turbo Nissan 300ZX.  The 7-Series long list of standard and optional features includes an integrated cellular phone, all-season traction control, xenon headlights and extra-thick window glass.

Included in the update are OnStar, steering wheel-mounted audio controls and stability control. With room for up to nine passengers, gutsy V8 engines and numerous passenger amenities, the 2006 GMC Yukon is a full-featured family SUV that's tough to beat. GMC is no newcomer to the sport-ute game; it rolled out its version of a full-size SUV more than 30 years ago. Its current model, the Yukon, debuted in 1992. Formerly known as the Jimmy, the Yukon was built to be a rough-and-ready, go-anywhere sort of ride. Back when it first emerged, GMC described it as a ""rugged, multipurpose family vehicle that's at home on and off the road,"" and the manufacturer has always seen to it that the vehicle is sturdy enough to live up to this promise. The 2000 model year brought with it a complete redesign for the Yukon. Its decade-old platform was replaced with a new frame that was stronger and more rigid than previous designs; the Yukon also got two new V8 engines that provided it with more horsepower than ever before.In 2001, the upscale Denali model was moved to the new platform and in the process picked up a 6.0-liter V8 as well as numerous other luxury amenities. The Yukon continues to give drivers more of what has made the vehicle a favorite with those seeking transportation that efficiently handles both on-road and off-road adventures. With a roomy and comfortable interior, it makes a great weekend-getaway machine. If you want a full-size SUV that can handle passengers and cargo as well as it does a backcountry road, the 2006 GMC Yukon should be on your short list. The 4.8-liter V8, offering 285 horsepower and 295 pound-feet of torque, is standard on two-wheel-drive Yukons. A larger 5.3-liter V8 with 295  and 335 lb-ft of torque is optional and comes standard on four-wheel-drive Yukons. The Yukon Denali, which has a standard all-wheel-drive system, is the most powerful version thanks to a 6.0-liter V8 rated at 335  and 375 lb-ft of torque. All engines are connected to a standard four-speed automatic transmission. Properly equipped, the standard Yukon can tow up to 7,700 pounds, and the Yukon Denali can handle up to 8,100 pounds. The Yukon has a tire-pressure monitoring system, dual-stage front airbags (with a passenger sensing system), stability control and four-wheel antilock disc brakes. Side airbags are standard on the Yukon Denali and optional on other trims. In NHTSA government crash testing, the GMC Yukon rated four out of a possible five stars for driver and front-passenger protection in frontal impacts. Any one of the Yukon's V8 engines delivers ample power in most situations. Those who pull a trailer often would be wise to opt for the 5.3-liter engine, as it provides a substantial bump in torque despite only 10 additional horsepower compared to the 4.8-liter V8. For the ultimate in luxury and towing power, the Yukon Denali is the best of this bunch. The suspension delivers a stable, smooth ride, regardless of whether it travels on or off pavement, while the steering is light enough to maneuver the big sport-ute easily in tight situations. Inside, the 2006 GMC Yukon offers comfortable seating and simple controls, but the quality of interior materials could stand improvement. Second-row bucket seats are available when you order leather upholstery, as is a DVD-based entertainment system. An optional 50/50-split third-row seat gives the Yukon nine-passenger seating capacity. With the third-row seats removed and the second-row seats folded forward, the Yukon offers 104 cubic feet of cargo volume. The GMC Yukon comes in three trim levels -- SL, SLE and Denali. The base SL boasts standard features like tri-zone manual climate control, keyless entry, cruise control, a CD player and OnStar. The uplevel SLE model is similar but grants access to additional features like power front seats, leather upholstery, satellite radio and rear audio controls via an SLT option package. Top-of-the-line Denali models come standard with just about every feature available, although items like a DVD-based entertainment system, second-row captain's chairs and a sunroof are still optional.",V8 cylinder ,165," 295 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Few sedans  are more powerful than the 2018 Audi S8. With 605 horsepower courtesy of its  twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8 and an optional 190 mph top speed, the S8 falls  into an elite group. Combined with standard all-wheel drive, the resulting  acceleration can make some supercars envious.  As  preposterous as its abilities may seem, the S8 remains an understated machine.  It is a flagship luxury sedan, after all, and in this role comfort is as big of  a priority as performance. Like the A8 on which it's based, the S8's interior  boasts extensive leather upholstery and attractive materials throughout. From  its smooth-riding air suspension to its extensive number of standard features,  the S8 delivers on every front. Flagship luxury sedans are always powerful, but the 2018 Audi S8 is among the fastest. This A8-based sedan sports vastly higher performance from a 605-horsepower V8 and a sport-tuned suspension. If you're looking for autobahn-worthy capability, the S8 is your car. Although we've driven the related A8 sedan, Edmunds has not yet driven any version of this vehicle. The following is our first take on what's significant about it and what you can expect. Combining an absurd amount of power with the refinement one expects from an executive luxury sedan makes for a highly enjoyable, if unusual, driving experience. Whether you're cruising along on the freeway or facing a red light with an empty street ahead, the Audi S8 always delivers satisfaction. The adaptive air suspension deftly balances sporty handling with a smooth ride. We also like the heated front seats that offer 22-way adjustment and massage. Rear occupants will appreciate the additional adjustment provided by four-zone climate control. Though its design is a few years old, the S8's interior still displays an attention to detail and cohesion in design. If a surface isn't high-quality leather or an attractive trim piece, it's probably simulated suede. And it's all customizable. A power, hands-free trunk makes it easy to load and unload, though the S8's 14.2 cubic-foot trunk isn't particularly generous for this class of car. The interior boasts plenty of cubbies and pockets for smaller personal items. The S8's MMI infotainment system is reasonably easy to use, but it's dated compared to the latest version of MMI available on other Audi vehicles. The proprietary music interface isn't nearly as versatile as having a USB port to plug in your phone. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are not available. The 2018 Audi S8 is only available in the Plus trim. As such, picking an S8 just comes down to what options you want. The Executive Plus is an obvious choice since it adds extra safety features that you'll likely appreciate having, such as lane departure warning and forward collision warning. We'd take the Dynamic package, too. It's more for the bragging rights associated with owning a sedan with a 190 mph top speed rather than any particular benefit coming from the package's carbon-ceramic brakes. As Audi's  flagship sedan, the S8 comes well equipped with standard features, including  21-inch wheels, a sport-tuned adaptive air suspension, LED exterior lighting, a  top-down parking camera system, parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring, a  panoramic sunroof, a power trunklid and soft-close doors. Interior amenities  include keyless entry and ignition, a head-up display, diamond-stitched leather  seating, four-zone climate control, 22-way power-adjustable front seats (with  massage, heating, and ventilation), and power rear window sunshades. The  infotainment system is accessed through an 8-inch retractable center display,  and it's supported by a 14-speaker Bose surround-sound system. Satellite radio  is included, but the S8 continues to have Audi's proprietary music interface  instead of a regular USB port. Last  year's Cold Weather and Driver Assistance packages have been combined into the  Executive Plus package, which includes lane departure warning and intervention,  traffic-adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning and mitigation, a  heated steering wheel, heated rear seats and rear-seat pass-through. The  Dynamics package fits the S8 with carbon-ceramic brakes and increases the car's  top-speed limiter to 190 mph.Notable  stand-alone options include a night-vision camera system and a 19-speaker Bang  & Olufsen sound system. The rest of the S8's packages are related to  customizing the sedan's color and trim combinations. ",V8 cylinder ,260," 517 lb-ft @ 1,750 ",all wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

Its low-slung, sloping roofline  paved the way for an entire genre of coupe-like SUVs, and though some  competitors do the swoopy sport ute thing slightly better, they owe their  existence to the X6.  Based  on the midsize X5 SUV, the X6 essentially takes that design and carves out a  portion of the roof to form a fastback rear end. The design grants it a sleeker  profile but also cuts into rear  headroom  and cargo space. It also hurts visibility since the rear windows are smaller.  Still, there are buyers who love the look enough to sacrifice those things in  the name of fashion. Though  the BMW had a healthy head start on its coupe-like SUV competition, its rivals  are now catching up to the original and in some cases surpassing it.  Raked-roofline SUVs such as the Audi Q8, Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupe and Porsche  Cayenne Coupe give the X6 a run for its money, though the BMW is able to stay  in the fight thanks to a high-quality interior, comfortable ride and sporty  driving dynamics.  Of the X6's two trim  levels, we think the base xDrive40i is the one to get. Its six-cylinder engine produces plenty of power and it  comes with a solid list of standard features out of the box.

The  2018 GMC Sierra 2500HD is a highly capable heavy-duty truck with lots of  extras. It can tow over 14,000 pounds, seat six and it's wrapped up in an  attractive package. If you need more capability than the Sierra 1500 but don't  want the added expense or size of the 3500, the 2500 is the obvious choice.  For  2018, the Sierra 2500HD doesn't change much, and that's not necessarily a  negative. A previously optional 7-inch touchscreen (with Apple CarPlay and  Android Auto) is now standard but there are no updates to powertrains,  suspension or features availability. That means that the 2500HD is still  well-built and high-class and as utilitarian as it needs to be. It also means  you can still get tech items such as the user-friendly Intellilink infotainment  interface or the optional Driver Alert package, which adds parking sensors,  lane departure warning and forward collision warning.Of  course, you'll also want to check out its corporate sibling, the Chevrolet  Silverado 2500. It's mechanically the same, but it's priced lower and with less  luxury equipment. For buyers who can do without the luxury gear, the Silverado  is certainly worth a closer look. On its own merits, though, the 2018 GMC  Sierra 2500HD is certainly a desirable truck with a lot to offer, even to the  most demanding of truck owners.  The 2018 GMC Sierra 2500HD is a highly capable heavy-duty truck with lots of extras. It'll tow more than 14,000 pounds and seat six, and it's wrapped up in an attractive package. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are  fundamentally similar. The  ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2017 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD LTZ Crew Cab Long Bed (turbo 6.6L  V8 diesel | 6-speed automatic | 4WD | 8-foot-2-inch bed). The Silverado is  essentially the GMC Sierra's twin, so many of our observations will apply. The 6.6-liter diesel makes massive torque and more than sufficient power, giving it a surge of acceleration off the line. In our testing, it covered 0-60 mph in just 7.7 seconds. In-town acceleration is more reserved, but there's still plenty of power to get the Sierra 2500HD up to freeway speed. These brakes don't offer much confidence. Under hard braking, the pedal can go all the way to the floor. Braking distances are long, but in traffic they seem to work well enough if you leave some distance. You just don't feel very connected to the action. The steering is well-weighted and provides stability when cruising straight, but it's hard to judge what the tires are doing around turns. The low steering ratio adds stability when towing, but it results in busy hands when parking or making U-turns. The big surprise is how well this gargantuan vehicle takes turns. There's minimal body roll around corners unless you're going way too fast. In parking lots and tight spaces, it maneuvers well enough considering its size. If you live in a city, drivability will be low with any 2500 series pickup truck. Otherwise, the diesel's low-end torque and abundant features make for a pretty approachable truck. Our test vehicle had plenty of ground clearance and the Off-Road Z71 package, which is a great deal for the price. You won't be taking this truck on any tight trails, but it will conquer your average dirt road. You'll find big, well-bolstered and comfortable seats no matter which seating position you're in. The seats are wide with sufficient contours to hold you in place, and they provide great road-trip comfort. This truck bounces, shimmies, shakes and jumps over the slightest road imperfections. That's forgivable in the 3500 class, but this 2500 should be a bit better. Load it up with a heavy payload or a big trailer, though, and the ride quality significantly improves. While road noise is subdued, quite a bit of wind noise comes from the truck's square front end and big mirrors. The diesel engine rumbles a bit, but it isn't particularly grating or abrasive while cruising on the highway. The big knobs and easy-to-read layouts are a plus. The air conditioning blows cold. The split-operation for the heated seats is a neat feature — you can heat your sore back without cooking your behind as well. The vents are vertically mounted, which isn't ideal, but they're easy to direct. The 2500HD's controls are easy to use with large, readable buttons and quick response times from the touchscreen. A grab handle and side steps make it easier to get in and out of the Sierra 2500HD, but some climbing is still involved. Still, getting in or out isn't any harder than usual for the HD truck class. Adjustable pedals, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, and a generally good view over the hood combine for an excellent driving position. You've got a commanding view of the road however you position the seat. Call all your NBA player friends and have them stretch out. You can be tall, wide — or both — and fit with no problem in this truck. It's big on the outside; so, there's lots of space for five people on the inside. All of the Sierra's roof pillars are wide and thick and obstruct your view. The big towing mirrors and the rearview camera help the situation, but knowing where the corners of the truck are is tough. Body panels and interior pieces are well put-together. We didn't notice any rattling, shaking or malfunctioning during our test. The interior materials aren't the nicest in the class, but they certainly suffice for such a utility-focused vehicle. Massive pockets are everywhere. A giant center console, a split-open glovebox, multiple cupholders in each door, both front and back. If you're looking for more small-item storage, the only place you'll find it is in the Ram equivalent, which has small, in-floor cooler boxes in the rear seat. Mirroring its rivals, the Sierra 2500HD is available with a standard bed (6 feet 6 inches) and a long bed (8 feet 1 inch). Our test truck had the long bed, which allows for a massive amount of cargo space. The rear seats fold up for big interior storage as well. The 2500 can fit three car seats in the back without much fuss. There are two sets of easily accessible lower latch anchors and three shelf anchors that are a bit harder to reach. But this truck's sheer altitude makes it less than desirable unless lifting kids is your workout program. The 6.6-liter turbodiesel has massive torque and power, but the Sierra's towing capacities are a bit lower than key rivals. The max trailer weight behind the 2500HD is 14,500 pounds; it can tow 18,100 pounds with a fifth-wheel trailer. All full-size truck beds are a similar size. This one can be accessed by corner bed steps built into the rear bumper corners. Payload maxes out at 3,204 pounds — lower than the class leaders, but only by a few hundred pounds. Menu logic on the GMC system is easy to understand, but not the most elegant in the class. Touchscreen responses are slower than class leaders. We like the look of the optional 8-inch touchscreen, but it doesn't stand out much from rival systems. Our experience with smartphone devices was poor, with many dropped connections over the course of the test. When it worked, we generally like the interface, but even then it takes quite a bit of time to load music. Best to use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Several attempts to use the built-in voice controls fell short, with a success rate of about 50 percent. It was easier to use the physical knobs and touchscreen controls. That said, Siri and Google Voice can be accessed if you've paired your smartphone by holding the talk button longer. Yes, the maxed-out Denali trim  level of GMC Sierra 2500 is appealing, but not everyone buying a truck needs  all that luxury equipment. A sensible compromise is the SLT trim level with the optional 6.6-liter turbodiesel engine. The  SLT is still plenty upscale with features such as power-adjustable pedals, an  8-inch center touchscreen and leather upholstery, but it's a bit less  ostentatious. And, for the most part, you can equip the SLT with any individual  options you want, including towing packages, off-road suspension or high-tech  driver-assistance features. The  regular cab is available only with a long bed (8.2 feet), while the extended-  and crew-cab models can have a standard bed (6.5 feet) or a long bed. Unlike  its 3500HD big brother, the Sierra 2500HD is not available with a dual  rear-wheel (DRW, or dually) axle. The SLT trim is available only on the double  and crew cabs, and the Denali is available only as a crew cab.The base Sierra comes standard with a  6.0-liter V8 engine (360 hp and 380 lb-ft), a six-speed automatic transmission,  17-inch steel wheels, an automatic locking rear differential, xenon headlights,  LED daytime running lights, air conditioning, a choice of cloth or vinyl  upholstery, a 40/20/40-split front bench with a fold-down center armrest, a  60/40-split folding rear seat, rubber floor covering, a rearview camera, power  door locks, cruise control, a tilt-only steering wheel, a 7-inch IntelliLink  touchscreen infotainment system and a six-speaker sound system with two USB  ports, an auxiliary audio input jack, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto compatibility,  Bluetooth phone and audio, Pandora radio, and voice controls. Optional tech  equipment on the base Sierra 2500HD includes OnStar, 4G LTE Wi-Fi and satellite radio.From  the base Sierra on up, you have your choice of engine, too. A turbocharged  6.6-liter diesel V8 (445 hp and 910 lb-ft) is also available, and it is paired  to a different six-speed automatic. Buyers can also add a bi-fuel option to the  6.0-liter engine, allowing it to run on gasoline or compressed natural gas.If  the base truck isn't your flavor, then step up to the SLE. It gets most of the base trim's optional tech features plus an  upgraded 8-inch central touchscreen, 17-inch alloy wheels, tinted rear windows,  a remote locking EZ Lift & Lower tailgate, LED cargo box illumination,  remote keyless entry, carpeting, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, HD radio and  a CD player.With  a few more luxury items, the SLT trim level feels a bit better equipped than our standard work truck. It adds  18-inch chrome alloy wheels, additional chrome trim, foglights, power-folding  mirrors, dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, eight-way  power-adjustable and heated front seats (with power lumbar adjustment),  driver-seat memory settings, power-adjustable pedals, a tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, remote ignition and a 110-volt  household-style power outlet.For  a plush and upscale vibe, choose the Denali trim. It will get you even more chrome on the outside, 20-inch wheels, chrome  side steps, a spray-in bedliner, a power-sliding rear window with defogger,  front and rear parking sensors, a navigation system, wireless phone charging, a  Bose audio system, a configurable 8-inch driver information display, upgraded  interior trim, ventilated front seats and a heated steering wheel.Most  of the upper trims' extra standard features can be added to the lower trim  levels as options. Other option highlights, depending on trim level, include  different axle ratios, a bed storage box, various tonneau covers, trailering  mirrors, a sunroof, a gooseneck/fifth-wheel trailering prep package, and a  rear-seat entertainment system. There's also a Driver Alert package, which  includes front and rear parking sensors, lane departure warning, forward  collision warning and a safety-alert driver seat. The Z71 suspension package  adds hill descent control, skid plates, specially tuned shock absorbers and unique  styling tweaks. Also available (on SLT crew-cab models only) is the All Terrain  HD package, which includes off-road tires, the spray-in bedliner, a skid plate,  the Z71 suspension and a heated steering wheel.",V8 cylinder ,175," 380 lb-ft @ 4,200 ",rear wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic 
Chevrolet,chevrolet blazer,1997,chevrolet blazer 1997,"['Sporty styling, powerful V-6 engine, fun to drive, standard ABS']","[""Cheesy interior trimmings, no passenger's side airbag""]",3.7,"Those who prefer a liftgate over a tailgate have that option on 1997 four-door Blazers. A power sunroof is a new option for all Blazers, and models equipped with LT decor are equipped with a HomeLink transmitter that will open your garage, among other things. All-wheel-drive Blazers get four-wheel disc brakes, and automatic transmissions are revised for smoother shifting. Early-production 4WD two-door Blazers could be ordered with a ZR2 suspension package. Base Blazers get a chrome grille, while LT four-door models have body-color grilles in six exterior colors. Two new paint colors round out the changes. Back in 1982, Chevrolet rolled out the S-10 Blazer, the first modern compact sport-utility vehicle.  Fifteen years later, the Blazer remains a bestseller in one of the hottest automotive markets.  It's not hard to understand the Blazer's appeal.Powered by a strong 4.3-liter, 190-horsepower, V6 engine and offering several suspension choices, the Blazer can be tailored to specific needs; with either two-wheel or four-wheel drive, two doors or four.  The four-door is the most popular by far; the model of choice with families on the go.  There are accommodations for as many as six passengers, but four would most likely be more comfortable.  Lots of cargo space too, with the spare tire mounted underneath the cargo floor on four-door models.  Chevy claims that, with the rear seat folded, a washing machine box will fit into the cargo bay.  We tried it with a test vehicle, and they aren't fibbing.  Sadly, the Blazer's interior is marred by acres of chintzy plastic and little rear foot room in front of a somewhat low and mushy seat.  Adult rear seat riders will complain loudly.Off-road is not where the Blazer shines, though a heavy-duty ZR2 suspension package is optional this year.  Available only on two-door 4WD models, the ZR2 Blazer has a special chassis with four-inch wider track, huge 31-inch tires, specially-tuned Bilstein 46mm shocks, drivetrain refinements, an underbody shield package, and LS trim.  Regular Blazers are capable enough for two-track dirt, but serious off-road adventures would be better handled by something with more wheel travel.  However, most families don't spend much, if any, time off-road in their sport-utes, so this is not a large shortcoming.  As a road going hauler, the Blazer is quite capable.  An all-wheel drive option is available on four-door models with LT decor, making the Blazer even more sure-footed.  For 1997, Chevrolet offers an optional liftgate on the four-door Blazer.  Standard is a two-piece hatch and tailgate.  The new liftgate features separately opening glass and a rear washer/wiper system with rear defroster.  A power sunroof is new to the options list, and LT models have a new HomeLink transmitter that will operate up to three remote-controlled systems as you pull up to your estate.  Also new to the LT are body-color grilles in six exterior colors; base models drop their gray grille in favor of chrome.  Order all-wheel drive on your Blazer LT and you'll get four-wheel disc brakes in place of the standard front disc/rear drum setup.  Two new exterior colors debut for 1997: Fairway Green Metallic and Medium Beige Mystique Metallic.  Finally, transmission improvements result in smoother shifts.When the current Blazer debuted for the 1995 model year, it won the North American Truck of the Year award.  Smart styling, a powerful drivetrain, and reasonable pricing made it a hit with the public.  Lately, however, the competition has caught up with the Blazer.  A new V6 engine goes into the more refined Ford Explorer for 1997, and it is more powerful than the Blazer's motor.  Jeep updated the Cherokee this year, offering dual airbags and four-wheel drive for less than $20,000.  The Blazer isn't the value it used to be.  We certainly like this sport-ute, however, poor crash test scores prevent us from recommending it.",V6 cylinder ,188," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",four wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

It's a small, relatively  lightweight and highly entertaining two-door luxury car. Available as both a  coupe and convertible, the 2 Series feels like a bit of a throwback for BMW,  though that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's nimble and athletic in a way  that few cars today are. It's fun to drive thanks to a pair of turbocharged  engines and a suspension that's sporty but not uncomfortable. The fact that you  can still get it with a manual transmission is even more of a bonus. The  interior is handsome, even if the design is starting to feel a bit dated. This  car did make its debut back in 2014, though we expect a new model to roll out  soon.  
There  are few competitors in this class, and most rivals to the 2 Series are  four-door sedans. Those include the Audi A3, the Mercedes-Benz A-Class and CLA  as well as the four-door BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe (a wholly different vehicle  that's reviewed separately). The few coupes and convertibles at this price  point are more traditional sports cars such as the Ford Mustang and Chevrolet  Camaro. Those cars are larger and more powerful, but they're not nearly as well  appointed as the BMW. 
While  it may not share the same name, the 2 Series feels like a spiritual successor  to older, smaller BMW 3 Series models. And on-paper figures and stats don't  tell the whole story with this car. The current 2 Series coupe and convertible  might be nearing the end of their lives, but we still think they're charming  and entertaining machines.  While  we love the buttery smooth engine in the M240i, we think most people will be  more than satisfied with the base 230i trim.

Automatic NSXs continue with the 3.0-liter, 252-horse V6. Since its 1991 introduction, the Acura NSX has been heralded by much of the motoring press as the best sports car ever produced.  Certainly, with its 24-valve V6 engine, all-aluminum body, mid-engine layout and traditionally Honda-correct ergonomics, the NSX is a heckuva car.  But the best sports car ever made?  We're not too sure about that.First, there is the issue of the NSX's ability to keep up with the best sports cars in the world.  Sure, it handles well, but its acceleration figures barely matched that of American muscle cars like the Chevrolet Camaro Z28 and the Pontiac Trans Am.  To answer critics who claimed that the NSX lacks the gusto of a true supercar, Acura increased the NSX's displacement to 3.2-liters and added a six-speed manual transmission.  (Models equipped with an automaitc transmission make due with the previous 3.0-liter engine.)  The new engine cranks out 290-horsepower and moves the car to 60 mph in about five seconds.  The second issue has had to due with the Acura's prohibitive price.  Retailing for $84,000, the NSX is not a bargain, and is dangerously close in price to the Dodge Viper and the Porsche 911 Carerra.   Additionally, a redesigned Corvette, and new roadsters from BMW, Porsche, and Mercedes-Benz, are available for roughly half of the price of the NSX.While the future of the NSX is not certain, we think that it is a car worth considering.  Its revitalized powerplant makes it more appealing for those desiring a supercar, while its livable interior and excellent ergonomics make it practical enough to live with on a day-to-day basis.",V6 cylinder ,200," 224 lb-ft @ 5,300 ",rear wheel drive , 6-speed manual

A Quadra-coil suspension improves on- and off-road manners; while dual airbags and optional antilock brakes increase the Wrangler's ability to keep occupants safe. Round, retro-style headlights add a nostalgic touch to this venerable ground-pounder. Fortunately, none of these refinements soften the Wrangler's tough exterior. A restyled interior includes integrated air vents, a glovebox and carlike stereo controls and accessory switches. We were a little concerned when we heard that Jeep was giving its bad-boy mud-machine an overhaul.  Luckily, the Wrangler hasn't received the leather interior, cellular phone makeover that has recently emasculated so much of the sport-utility segment.  No, the Wrangler remains the drive-me-hard-through-the-slop beast of yesterday; with a few appreciated improvements.Jeep Wranglers have long been the standard for those valiant explorers who truly wish to go where no one has gone before.  If anything, the go-anywhere ability of the Wrangler has been improved by the Quadra-coil suspension which allows an additional seven inches of articulation over the old leaf spring set-up; thus resulting in increased approach and departure angles.  Jeep boasts that the Quadra-coil suspension, as well as improved shocks and tires, also greatly improves the Wrangler's on-road manners. The Wrangler receives minor adjustments to the engine.  Reduced engine noise and vibration, as well as improved responsiveness, were the goals of the minor driveline makeover.  Nobody, however, will mistake this vehicle for a smooth-running family sedan; the Wrangler is very much a truck.  A five-speed manual transmission remains standard and a three-speed automatic is available for those who find it too tedious to depress a clutch pedal.  The interior of the Wrangler is where most people will notice changes.  Gone is the flat, no-frills dashboard and instrument panel.  An ergonomically superior command center with integrated HVAC and stereo controls will ease driver anxiety when trying to adjust the temperature or volume while driving.  A lockable glovebox replaces what was once an open hole in the dash.  If all this sounds a little too citified, don't be alarmed.  There is a bounce-bar tacked onto the dash that reminds you of this Jeep's intended purpose.We feel that Jeep has done a great job improving the Wrangler.  Gone are some of the nagging complaints we had about safety, wind noise and engine roar; what remains is a solid truck with hard-core capabilities and rugged good looks.  This is obviously not the truck for everybody; but those willing to put up with a cloth interior and a little road noise will be rewarded with an amazingly fun vehicle.

The Explorer is no exception.'],4,"The 1999 Ford Explorer gets exterior revisions including new foglamps, rocker panel moldings, wheel moldings, running boards and wheels. Harvest Gold, Chestnut, Deep Wedgewood, Spruce Green and Tropic Green replace Light Prairie Tan, Desert Violet, Light Denim Blue, Pacific Green and Evergreen Frost on the color chart. New options include a reverse sensing system and rear load leveling. Side-impact airbags are also newly available. Since its introduction in 1991, the Ford Explorer has resided at the top of the sport utility sales heap.  With good reason, the Explorer combines style, comfort and room in a go-anywhere package.  The modern day Country Squire, some have called it, after the segment leading station wagon of the 1950s.We think that there's a good reason for this.  Simply stated, the Explorer is a more refined vehicle than the competition at Jeep and General Motors.  The interior instills a feeling of quality that is missing from the Blazer. Jeep's all-new Grand Cherokee has made up much of the distance between its interior and the Explorer's.  An organically sweeping dashboard houses radio controls that can actually be operated without a magnifying glass.  Materials in the Explorer look and feel rich.  Rear seat comfort surpasses Chevy, and entry/exit is easier than Jeep.  Explorers offer more cargo capacity than most rivals do, and five passengers can ride with ease.  Exterior styling is a subjective matter, but we think that the Explorer is an attractive SUV.The Explorer's standard 4.0-liter V6 is the puniest engine found in a domestic sport-ute.  Acceleration is fine from a standstill, but step on the gas at 50 mph and not much happens.  That's not good news when there's a need to pass or merge.  Ford also offers an OHV 5.0-liter V8 engine that used to power the previous generation Mustang GT.  While the acceleration with 5.0-liter motor is improved over the base V6, it gives up a lot in fuel consumption.  Fortunately, Ford introduced an optional SOHC V6 in 1997 that offers nearly as much power as the V8, for less money while offering greater fuel efficiency.  We recommend this engine over the other two engine choices due to its great power and affordable price.The Explorer gets exterior changes this year that include new quarter panel sheetmetal, body moldings, badging and running boards.  New options include a reverse sensing system, rear load leveling, automatic ride control and side impact air bags.Unlike the current Nissan Pathfinder, Explorers retain a distinctly truck-like character, which could be a bonus or a demerit.  They're tough and solid, and easy to maneuver, though steering is a little slow and ponderous, and the body leans through tight corners.  Braking is excellent, and the suspension has a compliant attitude, but Ford's Explorer can bounce around, making occupants regret the Denver omelet they had for breakfast.Ford has a philosophy of building vehicles that everyone can be happy with.  Sure, the Jeep Grand Cherokee feels sportier, and the Chevrolet Blazer looks cooler, but the Explorer has just the right amount of class and ruggedness to make it America's best-selling off-roader.  If you are thinking about buying an sport-ute, chances are you've already checked out the Explorer.

Toyota,toyota tacoma,1996,toyota tacoma 1996,,,4.6,"For the 1996 Toyota Tacoma, Regular Cab 4WD models can be equipped with a new Off-Road Package. Toyota's sixth-generation compact pickup debuted in April, as a 1995.5 model, with an actual model name: Tacoma.  It's supposed to suggest the rugged outdoors, as well as strength and adventure.  Any of three potent new engines goes under the hood, and the pickup rides an all-new chassis.  Toyota aimed at aggressive styling, inside and out, and Tacomas sport an excellent selection of interior fittings.  Regular and extended Xtracab bodies are available, with either two- or four-wheel drive.  A deep-sculpted grille/hood/fender structure imparts a sporty personality to the truck, to attract customers who select their 4x4s on non-utilitarian grounds. Two-wheel-drive Tacomas get a 2.4-liter four-cylinder base engine, rated 142 horsepower (26 more than the prior generation). Tacoma 4x4s earn a 150-horsepower, 2.7-liter four.  Toyota claims that its four-cylinder engines are comparable to V6s from competitors.  But if those won't suffice, consider the latest V6 option: a dual-overhead-cam, 24-valve unit that whips out 190 horses and 220 foot-pounds of torque.  With V6 power, borrowed from the bigger T100, this compact pickup can tow up to 5,000 pounds and soundly whip any factory sport truck in the stoplight dragrace.  In contrast, the V6 engine available in the prior-generation pickup delivered only 150 horsepower and 180 foot-pounds.All Tacomas have front coil springs instead of the former torsion bars, but 4x4s feature longer suspension travel than before, to improve ride/handling qualities, whether on- or off-road.  Track width has been increased, too, for a more stable ride.  Rack-and-pinion steering replaces the old recirculating-ball layout, for better feel and response.  Manual-shift trucks feature reverse-gear synchronization, to reduce gear noise when shifting into reverse.  Four-wheel antilock braking is an option, but all pickups contain an airbag for the driver.  In top-of-the-line SR5 Xtracab pickups, a One-Touch Hi-4 switch is available for easy, pushbutton engagement of four-wheel-drive.  By redesigning and lowering the floor by 1.6 inches, Toyota makes 4x4s easier to enter.Tacomas are produced at the NUMMI joint-venture facility in Fremont, California, having been designed in that state.  Options include cruise control, air conditioning, a sliding rear window, tilt steering wheel, and moonroof.  We like the Tacoma, but question the value it represents.

Excellent off-road capability.'],"[""Ford's engine choices are not as strong as the competition.""]",4.3,"The Standard trim level is replaced by the Work trim level.  XLT and Lariat models get standard four-wheel antilock brakes, and the XLT gets standard air conditioning.  All SuperCab models get a fourth door and horsepower is improved for engines across the board.  Option content is shuffled and simplified as Ford reduces the number of optional features. When Ford introduced the new family of F-Series trucks in 1996, as a 1997 model, there was uproar among old-school Blue Oval fans.  Gone were their beloved Twin-I-Beam suspensions, pushrod engines, and traditional styling.  The new model appeared with a short- and long-arm front suspension, overhead cam engines, and more swoops than a Dairy Queen sundae.Now that the vehicle has been out for a few years, naysayers have put their fears to rest.  The SLA suspension provides excellent on- and off-road articulation giving the most demanding drivers the best ride available in any truck.  Overhead cam engines provide capable acceleration and enough power to tow Rhode Island to the West Coast.  The swoopy exterior means that parking an F-Series truck in a crowded parking lot may be a bit of a challenge, but the outstanding visibility it gives when off-roading more than makes up for its somewhat sissified shape.The Ford F-Series' interior is also a breakthrough.  All of the Ford's hard edges have been softened, and the interior materials are not something that one would expect to see in a vehicle meant for a hard day's work.  When put to the test, however, the Ford's interior can stand up to the rigors thrown at it by the meanest of foreman and orneriest of ranch hands.  Until this vehicle came onto the scene, ergonomic and truck were not words that we were likely to use in the same sentence.  The positioning of the F-Series' controls, however, make this vehicle easier to drive than many mid-size sedans.Our main gripe about the new F-Series is its overly twitchy steering and the tall step-in height on the four-wheel drive model.  We've also not been to impressed with the F-Series engine choices, especially when compared to the GM pickup engine choices, but Ford has bumped output for both its six- and eight-cylinder engine choices this year, so maybe they can catch up a bit in the power department.The 1999 model year sees the addition of a standard fourth door to all SuperCab models and the simplification of the option selection process.  The Work trim level replaces the Standard trim level as the entry-level offering.  Ford also makes antilock brakes standard on the XLT and Lariat trims.  After driving several F-150s, it appears that Ford has taken a path designed to bring more personal use buyers into the Ford fold without alienating truck buyers who work their pickups hard.  Styling, always a subjective point, might turn potential buyers off with its free-flowing forms and smooth contours.  We, however, like its clean lines and lack of clutter, particularly around the grille. Ford should watch out, though, because the redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra are guaranteed to make a big splash on the sales chart this year.  Bigger, faster, and arguably better looking than the F-150, GM's new full-size trucks spell trouble for the Blue Oval.",V6 cylinder ,170," 250 lb-ft @ 3,000 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Smooth V6 engine.'],['Squat and dive when accelerating and braking is excessive.'],3.9,"An all-new Passat arrives wearing updated sheet metal over a stretched Audi A4 platform. Engine choices include a spunky turbocharged four or a silky V6. The Passat never sold well in the United States.  Weak original engine choices, ineffective early marketing efforts and a muddled brand identity that defeated sales across the board have all contributed to this car's seemingly invisible presence in the market.  Of course, the plain-vanilla styling of the original car didn't let the Passat stand out for much recognition other than the lack of a grille on the nose.Volkswagen has managed to increase brand awareness, quality and sales during the past few years.  As a result, the first-generation Passat received a good bit of attention from consumers during its final months of availability.  But it was getting stale quickly, so Volkswagen has released a brand new one this year for Americans to ponder.A runaway success in Europe, the new Passat deserves acclaim.  Based on a stretched Audi A4 platform and using plenty of Audi parts in its construction, the new Passat looks, feels, smells and drives like a more substantial car than its price tag would lead you to expect.Three models are available, available in sedan bodywork.  The base GLS, which costs little more than a  well-equipped Chevy Lumina, is powered by a zippy 1.8-liter turbocharged inline four-cylinder engine.  We drove a couple not long ago, and the car zoomed to 60 mph quickly when mated to a five-speed manual transmission.  Some turbo lag was evident at low rpm, but otherwise, the engine was perfectly capable of hauling around 3,100 pounds of Passat.  Equipped with a Tiptronic automanual transmission, however, the Passat GLS lacked verve around town.The GLS trim level is also available with a 2.8-liter V6 making 190 horsepower.  To get the V6, buyers will pay a stiff $2,500 tariff.  Opt for a full-boat GLX and you're buying the top-of-the-line Passat with all the trimmings, at about the same cost as a well-equipped Toyota Camry XLE V6.  Options on the GLX are limited to a five-speed automatic transmission with Tiptronic shifting technology and metallic paint.  Hard to go wrong here.Contemporary styling will wear well into the new century.  In fact, we find the Passat's design more pleasing than the similarly sized but more expensive and somewhat avant-garde Audi A6.  Our test Passats drove nicely, were solidly constructed and had great sound systems.  The suspension rolled too much in turns, but otherwise, the car was perfectly suited to both canyon running and grocery shopping with the kids.Volkswagen wants to double Passat sales in the United States with this new model.  After a week with the GLS five-speed, we doubt they'll have trouble.  In fact, a GLS wagon with a sunroof, the all-weather package and an attractive set of aftermarket alloy wheels would be our pick of the litter.  So equipped, it would cost about the same as a Ford Taurus SE wagon, but with better looks and that coveted German handling.They want drivers?

It cost less than its German rivals yet offered  more features and similar levels of comfort and quality. Sounds great, right?  Unfortunately, the IS 300 also suffered from a lack of driving refinement, a  distracting-to-use technology interface and a small cabin. 
Hoping  for a better result, Lexus is hitting a soft reset with the 2021 Lexus IS 300.  The exterior is only lightly refreshed, but there are substantial changes  underneath and inside that seek to solve the IS 300's most pressing problems.  Additional reinforcements and welds increase body rigidity, which Lexus says  improves handling and steering response among other benefits. Some suspension  components are lighter than before, which reduces unsprung mass and should  translate to a more comfortable ride. 
Inside,  Lexus has replaced the distracting-to-use mouse-like controller with a toucad  controller. This new system  eliminates the on-screen cursor that made the prior Lexus system difficult to  use. Touchscreen functionality and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are  also newly available too. The rest of the interior is pretty much unchanged.
Is  the 2021 IS 300 better than before? Most certainly. We don't expect the IS 300  will zoom up to the top of our small luxury sedan rankings, but it could be  worth a look if value is a priority. We  recommend sticking with the base IS 300  RWD unless you need the extra traction of all-wheel drive. The turbocharged  four-cylinder is more economical than the V6 and is nearly as powerful. None of  the options is prohibitively expensive, but if you only have a little wiggle  room in your budget, the Comfort package  is a must-have.

Ready to leave other cars in a thick cloud of white smoke? We love the 2017 Dodge Challenger's authentic muscle-car persona, whether you choose the capable V6 or one of the increasingly awesome V8s. We also appreciate the Challenger's available creature comforts and its surprising practicality.  Ready to leave other cars in a thick cloud of white smoke? The 2017 Dodge Challenger has an authentic muscle-car persona, whether you choose the capable V6 or one of the increasingly awesome V8s. We also appreciate the Challenger's available creature comforts and its surprising practicality. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of the 2015 Dodge Challenger SXT Plus Coupe (3.6L V6; 8-speed automatic). The 305-horsepower 3.6-liter V6 is smooth yet hard-revving. The 3,930-pound SXT accelerates from 0 to 60 mph in 6.4 seconds, which is a bit slower than rivals with base engines. Obviously, the Challenger's various V8s provide significantly quicker acceleration. The brake pedal feel is medium-firm and well-suited for everyday driving. During panic-stop testing, the portly Challenger needed just 104 feet to stop from 60 mph. This is a great result, but keep in mind it had the benefit of summer tires. Turn-in response is quick, though there is little in the way of feedback between the road and the driver. Some drivers could find the steering's hefty weighting to be a bit much for daily duties around town. There's no getting around it: For a sports coupe, the Challenger is big. And heavy. Even with our tester's Super Track Pak (which adds a sportier suspension and performance tires), body roll is pronounced when going around turns. Still, there's enough grip to have an enjoyable time. The Challenger's responsive steering helps maneuverability, but the car just feels big, especially on narrow roads and tight corners. The gas and brake pedal are responsive and easily modulated. The eight-speed automatic also shifts quickly and maintains gears well on grades. The front seats are comfortable, and we have no complaints after spending hours on the road. If one area could be improved, it is the front seat's insufficient lateral support. The door and center console armrests are nicely padded, though. Equipped with the Super Track Pak's firmer, sport-tuned suspension, the Challenger has a firm ride that's to be expected for the class. It does a great job absorbing small road imperfections but feels jarring over larger bumps and dips. You'll hardly notice the V6 at highway cruising speeds. The Challenger's sound deadening is quite good for the segment, although tire noise is evident over certain surfaces. Overall, it's a pretty quiet car. Controls consist of a combination of knobs and buttons that are large and easy to use. Some functions are tucked away in the touchscreen, but otherwise it's one of the most user-friendly interfaces in the industry. The doors are large and open fully, allowing the potential for easy entry and exit. That said, the Challenger's big doors are heavy, and their size is a hindrance in tight parking spaces. Rear seat access is a bit better than in rival muscle-car coupes. The Challenger has a lot of front legroom and shoulder room. Headroom is slightly compromised by the sunroof, though most 6-footers will still fit. The rear seat isn't quite made for all sizes, but it is far bigger than those of competitors and offers three seats versus two. Not good, but typical for the segment. There are significant blind spots over the shoulder. Forward sightlines are acceptable, but it can be difficult to judge the front corners. A large-display rearview camera is standard and helps considerably. The Challenger has decent small-item storage all around, and the moderately sized center console is useful for holding a variety of items. The trunk opening is large, and its capacity blows the class away with a midsize-sedan-like 16.2 cubic feet. The rear seatbacks fold in a 60/40-split configuration to expand the Challenger's space even further. We've had a lot of experience with older versions of Dodge's infotainment system, Uconnect, and we've even tested the newest Uconnect 8.4 system in other cars. We haven't tested it in the Challenger yet, but in those other cars, it offers crisp graphics, quick responses and simple, logical menus. At its core, the 2017 Dodge Challenger is a muscle car, so we'd have to start with one of the several robust V8s. The Challenger is available with many performance and luxury features that make it difficult to select just one variation. Given our fondness for the outrageously powerful (but expensive) SRT Hellcat, we'd try to select a similar version that's a little more budget-friendly. For that reason, we'd get the T/A Plus, which includes a 5.7-liter V8, Hellcat exterior styling and lots of interior upgrades.  First up is the SXT, powered by a 3.6-liter V6 engine (305 horsepower, 268 pound-feet of torque). Although the V6 Challenger isn't the fastest kid on the block, at least you'll be rolling with plenty of standard features. The SXT comes with 18-inch wheels, heated mirrors, keyless ignition and entry, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, dual-zone automatic climate control and a power driver seat. Tech features include Bluetooth, a 5-inch touchscreen and a six-speaker sound system with a USB port. Stepping up to the R/T adds a 5.7-liter V8 (372 , 400 lb-ft with the automatic and 375 , 410 lb-ft with the manual). Also included are 20-inch wheels, upgraded brakes, foglights and an active sport exhaust. The R/T Scat Pack is the next rung up the ladder. It's powered by an even larger V8, this one displacing 6.4 liters (485 , 475 lb-ft). In addition to the stronger engine, there's Brembo performance brakes (four-piston front and rear), a sport-tuned suspension, a black decklid spoiler, sport seats, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors and an Alpine audio system. Front and center in the cabin is an 8.4-inch touchscreen with the newest version of Uconnect, HD and satellite radio, two USB ports, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality.  The SRT 392 model builds upon the Scat Pack's offerings, adding xenon headlights, a special air intake, power-folding mirrors, beefier front Brembo brakes (six-piston front), adaptive suspension dampers, a power-adjustable and heated sport steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, leather upholstery, configurable driving modes, an 18-speaker audio system, navigation, and blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert.  The SRT Hellcat is all about raw speed, evidenced by its whomping supercharged 6.2-liter V8 (707 , 650 lb-ft). It's also equipped with unique exterior styling, a sportier suspension, quad exhaust tips, automatic high beams and automatic wipers.  Not too crazy, right? Most of the above trims pair a new set of features with an increasingly more powerful engine. The fun part is that many of the features and performance upgrades from the upper trims are available on the lower trims as part of subtrims and packages themselves. Buckle up. The R/T Shaker and 392 Hemi Scat Pack Shaker (a variant of the R/T and Scat Pack, respectively) add a Shaker hood with a large cold air-induction scoop extending through the hood as well as the Super Track Pak performance items (see below), black exterior trim elements and a sport steering wheel. Exclusive to the R/T version of this trim are the rearview camera, rear parking sensors, sport seats and satellite radio. The Scat Pack version gets the power-adjustable and heated steering wheel.  New for 2017 are the T/A and T/A 392 subtrims, which modify the R/T and Scat Pack, respectively. They include many upgrades from the Shaker variants, along with styling elements from the Hellcat, including the unique air intake that masquerades as a headlight.  Still with us? Going with the Plus versions of the SXT, R/T, R/T Shaker and T/A gets you a bunch of features. It ensures that all trims get 20-inch wheels, foglights, a rearview camera, rear parking sensors, the power-adjustable and heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated sport seats, leather upholstery, the 8.4-inch touchscreen and its entertainment features and the Alpine sound system. The SXT also gets the brakes from the R/T. The R/T Plus Shaker includes imitation-suede seat inserts. As we said, there are many features packages that add features to specific trims. We won't list them all, but here are a few notables: For those who like to turn the volume up to 11, the Sound Group I (SXT, R/T, R/T Shaker, T/A) adds the Alpine stereo system, while Sound Group II (all Plus models, both Scat Pack models, T/A 392) adds a nine-speaker system. The same models are eligible for the 18-speaker audio system with the Premium Audio package.  Looking for more luxury and safety features? Try the Cold Weather package (SXT, SXT Plus, R/T), which adds heated front seats and a heated steering wheel. The Driver Convenience package (all models except the SRT 392 and Hellcat) includes the xenon headlights, power-folding mirrors, rear parking sensors, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert,  and remote engine start. The Technology package (all models except the Hellcat) adds adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, automatic wipers and forward collision warning. The 2017 Challenger is all about performance, and there's no reason why the expensive trims should get all the fun. The Super Sport package for the SXT adds 20-inch wheels, a shorter rear-axle ratio, the performance brakes from the R/T, steering-wheel-mounted shift paddles and a rear spoiler. The Super Track Pak (all SXT and R/T models) includes the Super Sport's features, as well as the rearview camera, rear parking sensors, sport-tuned steering and suspension, and performance reporting functions in the trip computer (0-60 timer, g-force loads, etc.). Upgraded brakes are available on R/T and above trims with this package.  The Challenger also offers a variety of retro-look side- and hood-stripe options as well. The Blacktop package (SXT models, R/T, R/T Plus) adds black-colored exterior trim and a few other extra features from other packages. A sunroof and navigation system are optional on all Challenger trims.

It wasn't as spacious and couldn't match the towing capacity of  the Ford F-350 Super Duty or Ram 3500. But things have changed with the  overhauled 2020 Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD. Thanks to a redesigned cabin with  much more space than before, updated powertrains that deliver higher tow  ratings across the board, and more tech to help manage whatever you decide to  tow, haul or carry, the 3500HD is a far more compelling truck for 2020. 
Like  most everything in this class, the Silverado HD is available in a variety of  configurations and trims. There are three cab configurations, two bed lengths  and two engines to choose from. Additionally, you can select four-wheel drive  or dual rear wheels for even more capability. On top of all that, there are a  variety of trims, from a bare-bones Work Truck to a fully loaded High Country.  If it sounds a bit convoluted, that's because it is, but it also means there's  a Silverado 3500HD for just about every heavy-duty need.
All of this means the heavy-duty truck  segment is more competitive than ever. We will say that you might prefer the  Ram if you want a truck with a more luxurious-looking cabin. The 2020 F-350  gets a lot of updates too. But no one truck has a dramatic lead over another,  so your final decision could simply come down to brand loyalty or personal  preference.  For  most shoppers, we recommend the midlevel LT trim. It includes a few useful upgrades compared to the Work Truck (such as  additional USB ports), but the big benefit is a much larger pool of options and  packages. Going with the LT helps keep the overall cost manageable, too.

The Excel is long dead, and it's time to stop thinking of Hyundai as a second-rate automobile manufacturer.  Last year, the Accent and Sonata provided a strong hint that this South Korean automaker was finally learning how to build a good car.  This Elantra provides the proof.  Larger and more powerful than the first-generation Elantra, this car offers quite a bit of bang-for-your-buck in either sedan or wagon bodystyles.Under the hood is a 130-horsepower 1.8-liter Hyundai-designed ""Beta"" engine, which produces 90 percent of its torque at 2,300 rpm, resulting in snappy around-town performance.  Riding on a four-wheel independent suspension, the Elantra features a longer wheelbase and wider track than the original model, which contributes to smoother, more stable handling.  A speed-sensitive rack and pinion steering system communicates improved road feel to the driver.  GLS models can be ordered with four-channel antilock brakes, which read each wheel separately.Dual airbags are standard on the Elantra, housed in a two-piece dashboard designed to reduce the development of squeaks and rattles.  Adjustable headrests and seatbelt anchors are standard, and all models come with driver's side lumbar support and seat height adjustments.  GLS models get a 60/40 split folding rear seat.  Extensive use of sound deadening materials helps quiet this compact car.Base price for a 5-speed sedan is $11,100.  This price includes five-mph bumpers, rear window defroster, dual remote control mirrors, rear seat heat ducts, remote fuel and trunk releases, tilt steering, and speed-sensitive steering.  Another $2,250 nets buyers a GLS model with an automatic transmission, cassette stereo, power door locks, power outside mirrors, six-way adjustable driver's seat, split fold rear seat, power windows, four-wheel disc brakes, and performance-oriented tires.  Option Packages can add air conditioning, cruise control, and anti-lock brakes for less than $1,600 more.Good value?  Let's take a look.

The Pontiac offers superior content, the Dodge superior performance, the Honda a better reputation, and the Kia better value.  If Hyundai had priced the Elantra a bit more down market, it would make a compelling choice.  We like this Hyundai, but as it stands, the Elantra is likely to be passed over by most consumers, simply because of the nomenclature affixed to the decklid.",Inline 4 cylinder ,165," 122 lb-ft @ 5,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

New this year is a 325-horse, all-wheel-drive performance version called the C3. If you want power, the Sierra's got it. But if high-quality materials and solid build quality are also a priority, you might want to check the offerings from Ford and Toyota, as well. After a much-improved Sierra bowed in 1999, GMC's full-size pickup continues along the refinement trail for 2001. The Sierra 1500 (half-ton) employs a unique, three-piece frame construction. While it shares a platform and componentry with Chevrolet's Silverado, the Sierra gets some styling and feature enhancements to position the GMC as a ""professional grade"" truck.Looks and special content aside, the biggest draw for GMC's half-ton pickup is a first-class engine lineup. The base 200-horse, Vortec 4.3-liter V6 has been upgraded again this year to improve durability, emissions and fuel economy. But more impressive are the two available V8s, all of which have seen further refinements to reduce NVH (noise, vibration and harshness) and increase service life. The Vortec 4.8-liter V8 (with 270 horses/285 foot-pounds of torque) is standard on half-ton extended cabs, and a 5.3-liter V8 (with 285/325) is optional on all 1500s. Both enjoy a flat torque curve for sustained hauling power.Each version is available with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. As usual, there is a variety of configurations to choose from, including the regular (two-door) or extended (four-door) cabs, short (6.5-foot) or long (8-foot) beds, Wideside or Sportside box designs, and rear- or four-wheel-drive versions. What's more, there are three trim levels (SL, SLE or SLT) and a dizzying array of options and packages to custom equip your truck exactly the way you want it.Do you go off-roading? Choose the Z71 Off-Road Suspension package. Prefer to pick your own suspension settings? Try the ZX3 Manual Select Damping package. Plan to do a lot of towing? Go for the Z82 Heavy Duty Trailering Equipment package. Got heavy loads to haul? Opt for the Z85 Increased Capacity package. Like performance? Order the new C3, a sporty, high-end AWD model that's available only as an extended cab and built as a more practical alternative to Ford's supercharged SVT F-150 Lightning. The Sierra 1500's roomy interior offers ample storage space, including a center armrest that is large enough for a laptop computer or a six-pack of soda, depending on your priorities. Reduced-force airbags (with passenger-side on/off switch) are standard, plus a full complement of safety and convenience features too numerous to list here. Overall, Sierra is very competitive with the top Ford and Dodge offerings. But because GMC is now defining itself as the ""professional grade"" division for more demanding truck buyers, watch for price creep to start forcing less-affluent young cowboy types to look elsewhere.",V8 cylinder ,354," 285 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Though still a decent SUV, the 2008 Chevrolet TrailBlazer's aging design puts it at a disadvantage against newer competitors. The Chevrolet TrailBlazer represents what one could consider to be the old guard of midsize SUVs. In the midst of a consumer shift to carlike crossover SUVs, the TrailBlazer maintains the traditional SUV trait of truck-based architecture. While this provides advantages in terms of off-road performance and towing capacity, it limits the vehicle's appeal to those mostly interested in responsive handling and a well-packaged and versatile interior.The TrailBlazer was last redesigned in 2002, and its age is showing. Though performance and ride quality remain strong points, the Chevy's cabin design is dated and its handling, always circumspect, doesn't inspire much confidence. And unlike most rivals with optional third-row seating, the 2008 TrailBlazer makes do with just two rows and a passenger capacity limited to five.The 2008 Chevrolet TrailBlazer could still be a fair choice for consumers wanting a vehicle for frequent towing or off-road use. Some might also find appeal in the high-performance TrailBlazer SS. But overall, we think there are plenty of better choices for a mainstream midsize SUV. Models like the Ford Explorer and Toyota 4Runner handily top it in terms of cabin refinement and handling composure while also offering the option of third-row seating. This is also true for new crossovers like the Toyota Highlander and Saturn Outlook. Even if you are set on a TrailBlazer, the vehicle's evergreen status means you could pick up a certified-used model for additional savings. Chevy's TrailBlazer comes standard with a 4.2-liter inline-6 that generates 285 horsepower and 276 pound-feet of torque. A 5.3-liter V8 is optional, featuring 300  and 321 lb-ft of torque. Both engines are backed by a four-speed automatic transmission and a choice of rear-wheel or four-wheel drivelines.The TrailBlazer SS boasts a 6.0-liter V8 cranking out 390  and 400 lb-ft of torque, mated to a heavy-duty four-speed automatic. For the SS, one may choose standard 2WD or an available full-time AWD system that maximizes street performance instead of off-road ability. Either way, the SS is seriously quick and can hit 60 mph in just 6.3 seconds. Maximum towing capacity varies from 5,900 pounds on six-cylinder models to 6,800 pounds with either of the two V8s. The 2008 Chevrolet TrailBlazer includes standard antilock disc brakes, stability control, OnStar communications and side curtain airbags. Government frontal impact testing garnered three stars out of five for the driver and four stars for the front passenger, while side-impact crash testing resulted in a perfect five stars for the protection of both front and rear occupants. In frontal offset crash testing by the IIHS, the TrailBlazer received a ""Marginal"" score (the second-lowest ranking on a four-point scale). The 2008 Chevy TrailBlazer's standard suspension has both good and bad qualities. With tuning on the soft side, it offers an exceptionally comfortable ride around town and on the highway but loses composure quickly when pressed hard through corners or over bumpy terrain. The SS is a different story, delivering a firmer but still comfortable ride at normal road speeds. When pushed through corners and twisty roads, however, its body motions are extremely well controlled, with much more precise steering feel and very little lean. The TrailBlazer's cabin is rather bland and constructed with some subpar materials, but the layout is straightforward and it's reasonably comfortable for up to five adults. For its higher price tag, there's nothing exceptional about the SS model's interior aside from a silver-faced tach, monogrammed ""sport"" seats and a few pieces of bright trim. Cargo capacity is generous, however, with nearly 44 cubic feet of luggage space that increases to 80 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. The basic high-performance TrailBlazer SS (1SS) package is equipped similarly to the 1LT in terms of comfort and convenience features, but also incorporates upgraded V8 power, a sport-tuned suspension with quicker steering, high-performance brakes, 20-inch wheels, a limited-slip differential and special interior and exterior trim.  The top-of-the-line 3SS package is even more fully equipped, much like the 3LT package.",Inline 6 cylinder ,240," 276 lb-ft @ 4,600 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

A thoroughly capable full-size SUV that beats Ford and General Motors at their own game. Toyota is going after a sizable chunk of the full-size SUV market with the snazzy 2001 Sequoia, which slots between the 4Runner and Land Cruiser in price but not size. Larger than a Tahoe or Yukon and about the same size as an Expedition, Sequoia's length, width, height, wheelbase and interior space all measure greater than the Chevrolet and GMC, while third seat room and cargo space is larger than all three competing models. Ground clearance, at a healthy 11 inches, is substantially greater than Chevy, GMC and Ford, but Toyota only offers eight-passenger capacity, compared to a maximum of nine occupants on the Tahoe, Yukon  and Expedition. Stylistically resembling the progeny of a Tundra and a 4Runner, Sequoia is powered by a smooth and silent 4.7-liter, i-Force V8 making 240 horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque using regular unleaded fuel. Sequoia's V8 makes it the first Toyota truck to be certified as an ULEV (ultra-low-emission vehicle). For comparison, Toyota claims the Sequoia spews 40 percent fewer non-methane organic gases (NMOG) than the Ford Expedition with an LEV engine. Sequoia tows up to 6,500 pounds in two-wheel-drive format; four-wheelers can lug 300 fewer. Other hardware includes an independent double-wishbone front suspension complemented by a five-link live rear axle. Four-wheel disc antilock brakes are standard, while Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) is optional. Also helping protect occupants are three-point seatbelts in each seating position and optional curtain-shield side airbags. Two trim levels are available: SR5 and loaded-up Limited. The latter buys you standard gear like leather seating, power retractable exterior mirrors, dual air conditioning, seat heaters, ten-speaker JBL sound system and aluminum wheels. Limited also includes third-row seating, privacy glass, a roof rack, and a tow hitch. A power sunroof, side airbags, and VSC are optional on both editions.Sequoia will be built alongside the Tundra pickup truck near Terre Haute, Indiana. If you want one, consider this: Toyota expects to build only 60,000 Sequoias annually. We predict a serious shortfall, resulting in demand that far outstrips supply.

It's roomier, safer, more comfortable and a more powerful ride. The Excursion may be bigger, but that doesn't mean it's better. Unless you absolutely need the extra space, the Suburban is still our choice for the best all around full-size sport-utility. In the war of the SUVs, Ford took the lead for largest competitor. But in war, bigger is not always better -- just ask Goliath. While the 2000 Chevrolet Suburban may have David aspirations in this vehicular tete-a-tete, being small isn't part of its character. More importantly, this Suburban is completely redesigned and the engineers took that opportunity to capitalize on their long history of truck building by changing as much as they could. This 2000 model offers more comfort from a new stiffer frame and upgraded interiors, more power with two new small-block V8 engines, and more safety from side-impact airbags and larger brake pads.All Excursions aside, this vehicle is big. Coming in at a length of 18.3 feet, the heavy-duty 2500 weighs in at an impressive 5760 pounds -- almost 3 tons of truck. The body shape hasn't changed considerably, staying close to the fairly nondescript image this SUV has had for years. Towering above 6 feet for the four-wheel-drive models, it poses no less a threat than Ford's monster, which is 7 inches taller. However, 7 inches can make a difference -- a Suburban will fit in a standard garage. The 2000 Suburban comes in two models, the 1500 and the 2500, both offering two- and four-wheel-drive configurations. The 1500s come with a 285-horsepower, 5.3-liter V8 engine, while the 2500s have a 300-horsepower 6.0-liter V8. Both come from the new Vortec family of small-block engines and have more horsepower than previous Suburban engines. Fronting a four-speed automatic transmission, either combination proves to be a great workhorse, but not much of a sprinter.Ride and handling have been improved, with body strength and stiffness increasing 400 percent over last year's model. The 1500s are equipped with a new five-link coil spring rear suspension, allowing the truck to track better on gravel or washboard roads and giving you more wheel control. If you do lose control and end up in a moderate speed front-end collision, the 1500s are fitted with a new front crush cap, allowing the repair shop to simply swap it out without having to replace the entire front frame. The suspension on the 2500s comes with the same rear leaf springs as their Silverado stablemates, giving them heavy-duty towing capacities to go with that stronger V8.The interior has been changed substantially, making it more comfortable and convenient. More efficient placement of air ducts and moving the spare from inside to underneath the cargo floor have increased useable space, allowing better movement throughout. All the seats have improved seatback angles and upgrades include second-row captain's chairs and a driver's seat with more options than some near-luxury cars provide.This Suburban has a lot to offer. There are more cupholders for the soccer team and increased headroom for the business associates. The engineers took the time to change and modify everything that needed improvement. It's not the most stylish, nor the biggest SUV on the market, but a lot of time and effort seems to have paid off.",V8 cylinder ,160," 325 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Larger wheels and brakes are part of the engine upgrade. Two-stage front airbags, reduced steering effort, a Cold Weather package and Dynamic Brake Control round out the major changes for 2001. The U.S. finally gets the M3 we've been hoping for. Its combination of speed, handling and razor-sharp good looks make the 2001 BMW M3 one of the world's most sought-after sports cars, rear seat and all. In typical BMW fashion, the 3 Series lineup is being introduced in stages. The first models to change were the sedans, followed by the coupes, the convertible, and the wagon. This allows BMW to maintain customer interest in their best-selling platform over the course of several years.Sedan buyers can choose from an upgraded 2.5-liter inline six (models with this powerplant will now use the numerical designation of 325) that now makes 184 horsepower, or a new-for-2001 3.0-liter inline six (330 models). The latter engine, which debuted in the X5 3.0i, replaces the 2.8-liter engine across BMW's entire product line. Bumping horsepower and torque from the former engine's 193 and 206, respectively, to 225 and 214 in the 3.0-liter adds some noticeable punch to the 3 Series and helps keep it ahead of rivals like the Audi A4 and new Lexus IS 300.Riding on the same platform, the 3 Series sedans, coupes and convertible receive a standard five-speed manual transmission, a sport-tuned suspension, and ventilated front and rear disc brakes. Two versions of the coupe are available: the 325Ci, with the aforementioned 2.5-liter inline six, and the 330Ci with the more powerful 3.0-liter engine, larger brakes and standard 17-inch wheels. The more powerful 330 coupe reaches 60 from zero in just 6.4 seconds and features a broad torque band. Both engines meet low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards. A five-speed Steptronic automanual transmission is available for those who don't want to shift their own gears.Another new option for 2001 is all-wheel drive. Derived from the all-wheel-drive system found in the X5, ""xi"" models split 38 percent of the engine's power to the front wheels and 62 percent to the rear. The AWD package also includes a 0.7-inch increase in ride height and is available on both 325 and 330 sedans as well as the 325 wagon.If you opt for the 325Ci convertible, you'll have to lower the top manually unless you pop the extra cash for the power top, but 330Ci consumers get this perk standard. All convertibles come with a glass rear window and rollover protection. Wagon buyers will appreciate the touring models standard roof rack and rear window wiper, but, as with the sedan, don't expect to carry full-sized adults in the backseat for long periods of time.Safety equipment on all 3 Series models includes All-Season Traction (AST) and Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), along with dual front airbags, door-mounted side airbags and BMW's patented Head Protection System (S). New for 2001 is Dynamic Brake Control, which reinforces the driver's effort during emergency braking. Rear side airbags and xenon headlights remain optional.With the arrival of all-wheel drive and more powerful inline six cylinders, only one 3 Series model still offers superior performance; the all-new M3.",Inline 6 cylinder ,288," 262 lb-ft @ 4,900 ",rear wheel drive , 6-speed manual

An integrated child safety seat is optional, and the Expedition model has been replaced by a Premium trim package for the Sport.   Since its introduction in 1991, the Ford Explorer has resided at the top of the sport-utility sales heap.  With good reason; the Explorer combined style, comfort and room is one go-anywhere package.  The modern day Country Squire, some have called it, after the segment leading station wagon of the 1950s.Last year, Ford gave its golden child a makeover, including a new suspension, revised four-wheel drive system and dual airbags in the restyle.  Four-wheel antilock brakes made the list of standard equipment in 1995 as well.  What didn't make the cut was a more powerful powerplant, to do battle with the V8 Jeep Grand Cherokee and 200-horsepower V6 found in the Chevy Blazer and GMC Jimmy.This year, Ford squeezes a 5.0-liter V8 into the engine bay of the Explorer, available in two-wheel or all-wheel drive models.  Putting out 210 horsepower, the engine option includes a limited-slip differential.  A long time in coming, the existence of the V8 will ensure the Explorer's position on the sales charts for years to come.Simply stated, the Explorer is a more refined vehicle than the competition at Jeep and General Motors.  The interior goes quite a ways in instilling a quality feel that is missing from the Grand Cherokee and the Blazer.  An organically sweeping dashboard houses radio controls that can actually be operated without a magnifying glass.  Materials feel and look rich.  Rear seat comfort surpasses Chevy, and entry/exit is easier than Jeep.  Explorers offer more cargo capacity than most rivals.  Exterior styling is a subjective matter; we think the fender skirts on the Eddie Bauer make the Explorer look pudgy.  Chrome wheels, standard on the Eddie Bauer, ought to be a treat to clean for drivers in the rust belt.The Explorer's standard 4.0-liter V6 is the puniest engine in a domestic sport-ute. Acceleration is fine from a standstill, but step on the gas at 50 mph and not much happens. That's not good news when there's a need to pass or merge.  We recommend the V8 unless your travels are limited to around-town taxi duty.Other changes for 1996 include a revised Eddie Bauer accent color, the deletion of the standard cargo net, and the addition to the options list of an integrated child safety seat.  The two-door Expedition model, which looked to us like the automotive equivalent of George Foreman after a bout with several McDonald's Big Macs, has been axed in favor of a Premium Sport Package.  Let's hope the meaty fender flares went away with the Expedition moniker.  Luxury-oriented Limited models get 15-inch alloy wheels and an exclusive paint color.Unlike the reworked Chevy Blazer, Explorers retain a distinctly truck-like character, which could be either a bonus or a demerit. They're tough and solid, and easy to maneuver--though steering is a little slow and ponderous, and the body leans through tight corners.  Braking is excellent, and the suspension has a compliant attitude, but Ford's sportster can bounce around, and even grow woozy over uneven surfaces.Jeep's Grand Cherokee is more sporting in flavor and feel, while the Chevy Blazer offers excellent value.  Ford's Explorer straddles the middle ground in between, providing most of what people want most of the time.  Guess that's what makes it so popular.",V6 cylinder ,92," 225 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

GT Limiteds receive a standard All-Weather Package that includes heated front seats, heated outside mirrors and a windshield wiper de-icer. GT models now have larger front brakes, a new ignition switch illumination ring, standard floor mats and wood grain-patterned door switch trim. Other upgrades for all Legacys include a dome light off-delay and an internal trunk release (sedans only). A capable all-weather sedan or wagon for an agreeable price. Do you live in a place where it is often cold and snowy? Do you have an entire drawer at home dedicated to ""long johns?"" Do you like the idea of owning a vehicle with all-wheel drive? Do you dislike the idea of owning a gas-guzzling SUV? If you've answered ""yes"" to any or all of these questions, Subaru has a car it'd like you to take a look at.Subaru's midsize Legacy comes in both sedan and wagon form. It's powered by a 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine that makes 165 horsepower and 166 pound-feet of torque. This engine can be equipped with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. All versions of the Legacy are all-wheel drive. While the drivetrain provides more power than most other four-cylinder midsize cars, it comes up short compared to the V6s found in competitors. If you want a bigger engine, check out the Outback; it comes with a 212- six-cylinder.There are three different trim levels: L, GT and GT Limited (sedan only). Subaru outfits these cars with a high level of standard equipment. L models receive items like air conditioning, antilock brakes, cruise control, power windows and locks, and a tilt steering wheel. Going with a GT earns larger 16-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, special body add-ons, a power moonroof, a power driver seat and keyless entry. For the GT Limited sedan, Subaru takes a GT sedan and adds leather seating, an upgraded audio system and side airbags.The best reason to take a look at the Legacy is its all-wheel drive. With all four wheels receiving power, the Legacy is more stable than a two-wheel-drive car when it comes to driving on wet, snowy and icy roads. Even on dry roads, the Legacy is an entertaining car to pilot thanks to its compliant suspension and tight steering. For maximum fun, get the GT model with the five-speed manual transmission.Inside, the Legacy offers supportive seats and a roomy cabin. With the rear seats folded down, the wagon can hold 68.6 cubic feet of cargo. Interior design is straightforward, but it lacks the upscale look and feel found in the car's European competitors. In terms of protecting occupants, the Legacy has earned a four-star rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for driver and front passenger safety. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety has given the car a ""good"" rating for offset crash protection.Cars like the Audi A4 and Volkswagen Passat have more prestige associated with them, and their base prices are similar to the Legacy's. But load them up with equal amenities, and their stickers go skyward.

The 2010 BMW X3 xDrive30i is an excellent, if rather pricey, choice for driving enthusiasts who want a compact crossover SUV that feels and moves like a sport sedan. As the junior member of the company's SUV family, the 2010 BMW X3 has some big tire tracks to fill. As a Bimmer, it is expected to offer vigorous performance, athletic handling and a rewarding drive. But as a luxury crossover, it's also expected to offer versatility, a long list of modern conveniences and top-notch cabin materials. Happily, the X3 does the family proud.The X3 debuted six years ago as a trailblazer in this segment. It hasn't been fully redesigned since, though, and competitors from just about every mainstream luxury automaker have recently joined the party. As a result, the X3 has gotten a little lost in all the hype and hubbub. But there's still a lot to like, including sharp handling, a free-revving inline-6 engine, ample seating space and a generous cargo hold.However, the X3 is not without a few faults. The price to pay for the superb handling is a firm ride that may be too stiff for some folks. Also, the X3 is pricey compared to rivals such as the Acura RDX, Infiniti EX35 and Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class. In addition to these models, there's worthy competition in the form of the Audi Q5 and Volvo XC60 T6. All of the above are newer designs with plenty of standout attributes. Overall, however, the 2010 BMW X3 remains a respectable choice, and it's certainly a top pick for anyone wanting more driving pleasure from an SUV. Powering the all-wheel-drive BMW X3 xDrive30i is a 3.0-liter inline-6 engine that produces 260 horsepower and 225 pound-feet of torque. Power is routed through either a class-exclusive six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission with manual shift control. Notably, the automatic is a no-cost option.In our testing, a manual-transmission X3 scooted to 60 mph in 7.4 seconds. EPA estimated fuel ratings for the automatic transmission are 17 mpg city/24 mpg highway and 20 mpg in combined driving. The manual transmission merits the same except for combined, where it comes in at 19 mpg. Standard safety equipment includes antilock disc brakes, automatic brake drying, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags, active front-seat head restraints, stability control and hill descent control. Rear-seat side airbags are available as an option.In crash testing conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the 2010 BMW X3 was awarded the highest rating of ""Good"" for protection in both frontal-offset and side impacts. Among small luxury crossover SUVs, the 2010 BMW X3 xDrive30i has no equal on curvy roads, thanks to superior steering feel, sharp suspension tuning and smooth, eager performance from the inline-6 with either transmission. However, if you're looking for a comfortable family vehicle, the X3's relatively stiff ride -- especially with the optional sport suspension -- likely won't impress. High-speed stability is excellent, though, and the X3 generally imparts a sense of confidence and control. Aside from the ride quality, this BMW's driving dynamics are beyond reproach. The X3's interior is attractive and fitted with high-quality materials. The standard front seats are comfortable and firm, with sufficient support for sporty driving; there are also optional sport seats and sublimely comfortable 16-way power seats. The rear seats are quite agreeable as well, with plenty of head- and legroom for average adults.One annoyance is that the controls for the ventilation, audio and optional navigation system can be fussy to operate. You might also be surprised that a rear entertainment system isn't available as a factory option. Rear storage is generous, measuring 30 cubic feet of space with the rear seats in use. With the 60/40-split rear seatbacks lowered, cargo capacity is upped to an impressive 71 cubes. Options are largely grouped into packages. The Sport Activity package includes 18-inch wheels, running boards, a sport steering wheel and rear privacy glass. The Premium package includes a panoramic sunroof, leather upholstery, auto-dimming mirrors, ambient lighting and Bluetooth. Opting for the Sport package nets a stiffer sport suspension, sport front seats and steering wheel and body styling accents.Other options include 19-inch alloy wheels with higher-performance tires, speed sensitive steering, a premium audio system, 16-way power front seats, a navigation system, heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel, adaptive xenon headlights and front and rear parking sensors.",Inline 6 cylinder ,235," 225 lb-ft @ 2,750 ",all wheel drive , 6-speed manual

This full-size truck is purpose-built for moving the heaviest stuff  possible from a truck you can still park in your (very wide) driveway. 
Central  to these feats of strength is the F-450's turbodiesel V8 engine. With 1,050  lb-ft of torque, there's not much in the realm of weekend recreation that it  can't pull. It also makes the F-450 an ideal pickup for the lighter hauling  jobs of the heaviest commercial and construction work.
For  2021, the F-450 carries over with only a few minor feature changes, and its  fundamental strength remains the same: This truck can handle some weight. Sure,  it boasts a massive 37,000-pound maximum tow rating, but the F-450 is more than  just a hearty mule. Wildly checking off the options list can produce a truck  with sophisticated features and luxuries, such as massaging seats and a  leather-wrapped dashboard. The F-450 also comes with an impressive list of tech  features, including driver assistance features such as trailering blind-spot  warning and semi-automated steering that eases the stress of backing up a  trailer.
You'll  likely end up paying more for the F-450 than other heavy-duty trucks such as  the F-350 and Chevrolet Silverado 3500HD and Ram 3500HD. But it will be worth  it if you need all of that maximum capability that the F-450 provides. If  you need to tow things that move earth or make office buildings, you can  probably get by with the F-450's XL and XLT workhorse trims. But if long trips  with big boats, horse trailers or fifth-wheels are more your style, consider  the extra luxuries of the Lariat and Platinum trims. We think the XLT hits the sweet spot. It's available  with either a regular or crew cab, offers maximum towing and hauling  capabilities, and covers the essentials with Sync 3 infotainment, Co-Pilot360  safety systems, and a handful of options such as heated seats and step bars.",V8 cylinder ,302," 1,050 lb-ft @ 1,600 ",rear wheel drive , 10-speed shiftable automatic

Honda enjoys the distinction of landing luxury cars in the United States before any other Japanese automaker had even considered the idea.  The Legend sedan, marketed under the Acura nameplate, was an interesting choice over domestic luxury sedans, and was an inexpensive and reliable alternative to European luxury marques.  However, Honda couldn't expect to sell enough Legends to keep its new Acura franchise afloat, so engineers spruced up the Honda Civic platform and introduced the nimble Integra to compliment the bigger sedan in showrooms.Since 1986, when the Integra debuted, it has garnered praise from a variety of automotive and consumer groups.  Integras have always been sporty, practical, fun-to-drive, and reliable.  Needless to say, they are popular cars with a wide demographic group.  The current iteration, which is the third generation of the Integra, is no exception to this rule.These sport coupes and sedans are quick and comfortable, with excellent build quality.  Since 1994, they've sported swoopy, modern styling, featuring quad, circular headlamps.  Unfortunately, the front fascia design is marred by a thick, black rubber molding between the edge of the hood and the fascia, and this cutline is painfully obvious on lighter-colored cars.The Type R was added to Integra's stable late in the summer, and it could be the standard by which all Japanese sport coupes are measured.  One-hundred and ninety-five horsepower at 8000 rpm, hand-polished intake and exhaust ports, and a high-flow exhaust system all make for a fire-breathing engine. Did we mention the 8500-redline?  Type ""R"" is for rrrrrev. Combined with that engine is a car that loses 93 pounds of weight, so stand by for takeoff. With Acura's legendary reliability, we recommend the Integra, particularly for those on a budget or in need of a set of sporty wheels.

Two new ""Protection""  trim levels are also available that provide light armor, bullet-resistant glass and run-flat tires. If money was no object and we needed a spacious, impressive set of wheels, the 7 Series would be our first choice. BMW's 7-Series seals power and luxury tightly together and throws a heap of style right on top.  All this, added to the vehicle's reputation for sophistication and snob appeal, make the 7-Series the pinnacle of prestige for those who desire the absolute snazziest ultra-luxury sedans.The stellar 7-Series lineup consists of the 740i, 740iL and 750iL.  Also available are two new trim levels: the 740iL Protection and 750iL Protection.  Powered by incredibly smooth V8 and V12 engines, these 7-Series super-luxury sedans are quite possibly the finest of their kind, providing exceptional comfort, rich appointments and rewarding performance.  Those who must have it all will want to check out the amazingly appointed V12 750iL.  Want a stereo that sounds better than a symphony hall?  Check.  Want an anti-theft security system that can put Fort Knox to shame?  Check.  Want a heated steering wheel?  Check.  Want 41 inches of rear legroom?  Check.  Shelling out nearly 100 grand for the supreme BMW will get you a fully outfitted luxury car with only two available options: side-impact rear airbags and break-resistant security glass.Those on a budget (ha, ha), should take a look at the 740i.  Tens of thousands of dollars less than its big brother, the 740i is geared towards buyers who are merely wealthy instead of obscenely rich.  This car has almost everything one could desire, but there are a few items on the option sheet that buyers may want to check out. Nestled snugly between the 750iL and the 740i is the 740iL-a vehicle that offers amazing relaxation with its 16-way front Comfort Seats.  The 740iL provides all of the space of the 750iL, but leaves enough money in the checking account to send your pride and joy to Stanford for one year. For those who may be living dangerously, two new Protection trim levels debut this year, providing light armor that protects against handguns, bullet-resistant glass and run-flat tires.The 2000 7-Series' long list of standard and optional features includes an integrated cellular phone, all-season traction control, Dynamic Stability Control, Dynamic Brake Control, rain-sensing windshield wipers, rear side airbags and extra-thick window glass.  The optional Cold Weather Package now includes heated rear seats; 740 shoppers also will be able to take advantage of the optional Adaptive Ride Package that provides Electronic Damping Control (EDC) and a Self-Leveling Suspension.  Personal safety features include double locked doors, coded drive-away protection, two-step unlocking, and front, side and head airbags.  The 740i and 740iL receive the Premium Package standard this year, and it consists of the navigation system, Xenon headlights, premium audio system with digital sound processing and a six-disc CD changer.  Also new for 2000 are the Active Comfort Seats-standard on the 750iL and optional on the other models.  Eighteen-inch alloy wheels are optional as well.  Despite these upgrades, 7-Series prices remain the same as last year.It is always difficult to choose the ""best"" in a class of outstanding competitors and, with super-luxury entries from Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Lexus and Infiniti, it seems flippant to say that one of these vehicles is superior to the others.

The RS trim level returns, and chrome-aluminum wheels are optional. ""From the country that invented rock n' roll,"" claim the advertisements for this Quebec, Canada-built sport coupe.  A small technicality, we suppose, but there are no technicalities when it comes to the Camaro's performance abilities, particularly in Z28 guise.  The Z is blazingly quick, holds the road tenaciously, costs less than the average price of a new car in this country, and gets decent gas mileage when it's not being hammered along a twisty two-lane road.For 1996, Camaro buyers will note few visual changes to their favorite pony car.  Cayenne Red Metallic paint is new this year, and chrome aluminum wheels are available to the gold chain set.  A new RS trim level is available, sporting lower front and rear fascia extensions, rocker panel moldings and a three-part spoiler.Engine enhancements are the big news this year.  The base engine is the 3800 Series II V6, which makes 200 horsepower.  That's 40 horsepower more than last year's base engine, and 45 more ponies than Ford's Mustang can produce.  Phased in during the 1995 model year, the new V6 can be mated to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission.  With a manual, the Series II V6 gets the Camaro to 60 mph nearly as quickly as a Ford Mustang GT.  In fact, the existence of this powerplant makes a strong argument for avoiding the higher insurance rates and prices of the Z28.  An optional Performance Handling Package puts bigger tires, alloy wheels, tighter steering, four-wheel disc brakes and a limited slip differential on the V6 Camaro.From a bang-for-the-buck standpoint, the Z28 is unbeatable.  A Corvette-derived 5.7-liter V8 gets 285 horsepower to the pavement through the rear wheels, 10 more horses than last year.  Also new is an SS version of the Z28, and it makes 300 horsepower, thanks to a big air scoop on the hood that forces cool air into the engine.  SLP Engineering, known for working magic with GM's F-bodies since the late 80s, does the conversion work on the Z28 SS.  See your dealer for details.  The interior of the Camaro is functional, if not slightly garish.  New trim cloth graces the cabin, and you can order your Camaro with a new interior color called Neutral.   The Camaro holds a respectable amount of gear in the cargo hold, and airbags and antilock brakes are standard.

Safety scores have been exceptional, even among European competitors such as Volvo, Mercedes, BMW, and Saab.  Of course, it's unlikely that you will ever need the A6's safety equipment because of the wonderful accident avoiding features Audi has thoughtfully included.  Optional Quattro all-wheel drive and an improved antilock braking system make the A6 a difficult car to send spinning out of control, or get stuck in a rut.  Audi claims that the Quattro will be able to move as long as one wheel is able to grip.  Even without the Quattro option, the A6 has improved low speed traction as a result of its Electronic Differential Locking (EDL).All of this in a car loaded with standard equipment such as: a healthy 172-horsepower V6 engine, ABS, Chenille velour upholstery, burled walnut trim, power everything, and room for two six-footers in the back seat.

Other improvements this year include side-curtain airbags, a five-speed automatic gearbox and an optional DVD video entertainment system. The Durango epitomizes the inherent reasons that SUVs were built -- utility, space and potency. Previously the only midsize SUV with a third-seat option, the Durango faces new competition this year from the recently revamped Explorer (now with optional third seat) and GM triplets (TrailBlazer, Envoy, Bravada). To counter, Dodge has added a couple of new features such as available side-curtain airbags and an optional DVD entertainment system for rear-seat passengers.The new entry-level SXT model is no stripper, equipped as it is with 16-inch alloys, a CD player, bucket seats and an appearance group that includes a graphite-colored grille, fasciae (front and rear) and fender flares. Other trim levels, the SLT, SLT Plus and R/T, continue as before.In spite of sporting comfortably plush seats, the large cabin still earns a few demerits, most notably some hard, shiny plastic trim; chunky A-pillars that hamper visibility; and small stereo controls, problems which plague many Chrysler products. Durangos can be had in a choice of two- or four-wheel-drive configuration. Either way, the standard powerplant is the contemporary 4.7-liter V8 that pumps out 235 horsepower. Throttle response with this engine is excellent, with power accessible from a broad rev range. For 2002, Dodge has dropped the four-speed automatic in favor of a new five-speed.If heavy-duty hauling is going to be a regular part of your Durango's workload, the optional (and thirsty) 245-horse 5.9-liter V8 is the best choice. So equipped, the Durango can pull up to 7,600 pounds.  In terms of handling dynamics, body roll is well controlled, and, with the help of the full-time all-wheel drive and responsive, tight steering, enable the Durango to run through twisty two-lane roads with confidence, sans the tippy feeling that some other utes are plagued with. And even when fully loaded with seven passengers, the suspension handles the payload with little effort. Not trying to be all things to all people, the Durango is a truck-based sport-ute that makes no apologies for its somewhat stiffer ride. But even though the rugged Durango's design dates back to 1998, Dodge has judiciously updated it, allowing it to remain a solid choice for folks who need plenty of seating and hauling capacity in their midsize ute.",V8 cylinder ,190," 295 lb-ft @ 3,200 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed automatic

The six-cylinder models drop the 325 designation for 328, thanks to a new 2.8-liter inline six. While the new six offers a negligible gain in horsepower (now 190), acceleration is significantly improved by a 14 percent increase in torque (now up to 207). To go along with the heartier engine, 328 models get vented rear disc brakes to minimize brake fade. The 318 models keep the 318 name despite an increase in engine displacement to 1.9 liters, which yields a slight increase in torque. Automatic climate control is standard across the line, except in the 318ti, and upgraded sound systems are optional on all models. BMW has added an M3 model to the 3-Series lineup for 1995, and it's been winning rave reviews from the press and public.  The M3 has a 240-horsepower inline six purring away under the hood, suspension modifications designed specifically for the war-torn roads of America, huge brakes, and supple leather seats; all for less than $40,000.  Sadly, a sedan version is not planned for the U.S.Also new this year, a BMW hatchback based on the 3-Series.  Called the 318ti, it's priced evenly with the Volkswagen GTI, though performance levels fall a bit short of those of the vaunted VW.  Identical to the 318i from the A-pillar forward, the 318ti should win the hearts of younger, less-affluent buyers looking for Germanic sporting fun.The rest of the 3-Series line carries over for 1995, which is no bad thing.  This BMW has won the favor of driving enthusiasts everywhere for its capable handling, first-class ergonomics, and classic styling.  Prices start right around the $25,000 mark, just $5,000 above the average price of a new car in the U.S.  The 325i and 325is, two of the three performers in the lineup, do have base prices that are a bit higher.Bottom rung 318's are powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder, while midrange 325 cars have a 189-horsepower six doing the motivational work.

Remote keyless entry is standard on four-door models, and on SLE and SLT two-door models. Optional on four-door models is a rear air conditioning unit. Until this year, General Motors had a lock on the midsize sport-utility market, but couldn't build enough to meet demand because of a serious lack of production capacity.  The result?  Inflated prices as dealers struggled to keep the Yukon and Tahoe in stock.  This year, GM is refurbishing a plant in Arlington, Texas, which used to produce full-size Buick, Chevrolet, and Cadillac sedans, and Yukon/Tahoe production will begin in the Lone Star State sometime this spring.Unfortunately for GM, the additional plant capacity may be coming a bit too late.  Ford released the midsized Expedition last fall, and this F-150 pickup-based SUV is more refined but less powerful than the GM twins.  Next year, Dodge releases the Durango, based on the fresh Dakota platform and sure to be slightly smaller and easier to maneuver than the GM and Ford behemoths.  Jeep, too, is expected to get into the game by the end of the millenium, introducing a midsized sport-ute called the Grand Wagoneer.In the size race, the Yukon fits squarely between the Jimmy compact and the big-bruiser Suburban wagons.  Squint your eyes, in fact, and the difference between a Yukon and Suburban begins to evaporate, despite the latter's extra 20 inches of steel.  Ford's Expedition is a bit larger, and offers eight-passenger seating, which is not available on the Yukon.Yukon's interior has been borrowed from the full-size Sierra pickup, including new-for-1997 dual airbags.  The cargo bay receives a power door lock switch -- a sensible addition, and one not available from Ford.  Rear passengers can be made more comfortable with the addition of a rear air conditioning unit.  Remote keyless entry is made standard on four-door models, and two-door Yukons with SLE or SLT trim.  Order the SLT trim on either Yukon, and a stereo featuring both cassette and CD players is part of the package.  Speed-sensitive steering makes low-speed parking easier and provides better road feel on the interstate, while 4WD models have a tighter turning circle than last year which should improve off-road maneuverability.  How does the Yukon stack up against the Expedition?  The Ford is more refined and comfortable, but we prefer Yukon's dated exterior styling.  The Ford is powered by smooth overhead-cam engines, but we prefer the torque and roar of GMC's Vortec 5700 V8 engine.  Neither is easy to climb into, particularly without running boards, but the Expedition has larger rear door openings which make entry/exit to the back seat much easier.  The Ford also boasts optional eight-passenger seating.  As drivers, however, we believe we'd prefer the Yukon's power over the Expedition's refinement.  Naturally, though, you can still expect truck-style ride and handling, but reasonable comfort on the road.With new competitors arriving annually and increased production capacity, GMC dealers have little reason to gouge customers on Yukon pricing.

Ford,ford explorer,2002,ford explorer 2002,"['Available third-row seating, independent rear suspension, powerful engines, attractive new exterior design.']","['Everyone and his uncle has one, driving characteristics are still pretty truck-like.']",4,"The 2002 Ford Explorer has been overhauled in an attempt to make it more carlike than ever before. Among the improvements are a 2.5-inch-wider stance and 2-inch-longer wheelbase for improved handling and roominess, a new independent rear suspension that improves ride and handling, while at the same time accommodating an optional third row of seats, larger door openings with a lower step-in height, an optional side curtain airbag system and an optional Reverse Sensing System. A great truck that suffers a terrible rap. Completely new for 2002, this Ford Explorer shares only its name with its much-maligned predecessor. Ford's Explorer has dominated the SUV market since its introduction in 1990. Designed to appeal to the broadest spectrum of buyers possible, Explorer's proven to be a goldmine for the Blue Oval folks. Still, it was getting a bit long in the tooth during the last couple of years. Thus, a complete redesign for 2002.There are four trim levels available: XLS, XLT, Eddie Bauer and Limited. The majority of Explorers sold are XLTs. If you want your Explorer to be as special as possible, step up to the Eddie Bauer or Limited. These models come standard with added luxury feature content like heated leather seats, automatic climate control and an in-dash six-disc CD changer. Standard safety features on all models include ABS with electronic brake distribution and a Securilock passive anti-theft system. Safety options worth considering are side curtain airbags and a Reverse Sensing System.Explorer comes with either a 4.0-liter V6 making 210 horsepower or a new 4.6-liter V8 pumping out 240 ponies. Both engines are mated to a five-speed automatic transmission and the V8 offers copious, refined power delivery, but unimpressive mileage numbers.Explorer has been made over inside and out, and the results are pleasing. Outside, it sports larger, clear lens headlights, integrated bumpers and blacked-out B- and D-pillars, giving it a cleaner look.  But the most significant changes are found inside and underneath. An all-new independent rear suspension featuring a unique porthole-in-frame design debuts this year. This setup allows the rear floor to drop 7 inches - thereby making room for an optional third-row seat - while increasing ground clearance to 9.2 inches. Cargo volume is 88 cubic feet with the five-passenger configuration and 81.3 cubes with the third-row seat installed.The all-new suspension also pays off in improved ride and handling characteristics. The Explorer now feels more stable on the road and exhibits flatter cornering capabilities.  A 2.5-inch wider stance and 2-inch longer wheelbase improve handling even more, while increasing interior room.Other nifty improvements for 2002 include larger door openings with a lower step-in height for ease of entry and exit, a stiffer body shell and a lower front bumper for better crash compatibility with smaller vehicles. Later in the model year, rollover protection sensors and a new AdvanceTrac traction/stability control system will be available on Explorer.Ford's bestseller may have fallen on hard times with the Firestone tire scandal in 2000, but this year's thorough redesign should go a long way in keeping America's favorite sport-ute at the top of its game.",V6 cylinder ,142," 254 lb-ft @ 3,750 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Last year's Cabela's package is now a trim level (it replaces the discontinued FX4 model), the axle ratios have been revised for increased fuel economy, Sync is now offered on all but the base XL, a new spray-in bedliner is available and the Harley-Davidson package is now available on diesel models only. The range-topping Lariat and Cabela's models receive a five-speed automatic transmission as standard equipment. The 2010 Ford F-250 Super Duty's stout construction, along with its various body styles, trim levels and options make it a serious contender within the heavy-duty pickup truck segment. The pickup truck is one of the great cornerstones of the American landscape. From small pickups making citywide deliveries to wilderness-taming 4x4s, there seems to be a truck to fit any need. For those requiring a full-size workhorse with the capability to haul and tow large loads, the 2010 Ford F-250 Super Duty is an accomplished choice in a small group of challengers.Just like its rivals, the Ford F-250 is able to withstand harsh conditions and haul an impressive amount of weight -- living up to its Super Duty name. Three engine choices offer varying levels of power to suit individual needs, but the real star of the show is the 6.4-liter turbodiesel version that can pull up to 12,500 pounds when properly equipped.Besides the F-250's rugged powertrain, a long list of features and options deliver added utility, comfort and convenience. Several trim levels and optional packages offer many variations of this broad-shouldered theme, from a no-nonsense work truck to a luxuriously appointed hauler. One of the most notable changes for 2010 involves last year's optional Cabela's package, which has replaced the FX4 off-road model as a trim level. Other changes include wider availability of Ford's Sync voice activation system and the Harley-Davidson package being limited to diesel models. Outside of the many choices within the 2010 Ford F-250's lineup, buyers are left with only a few alternatives in this class. Chevrolet's Silverado 2500 HD pickup (or its GMC clone) is the closest competitor and delivers a bit more towing ability. The new Dodge Ram 2500 can haul even more, while its interior is about as good as it gets in the segment. It's also worth noting that next year's redesigned F-250 promises a host of changes, most notably more powerful engines and a six-speed transmission. At the end of the day, though, the 2010 F-250 has solid work-truck capabilities and plenty of features and options to take on the most challenging demands. The 2010 Ford F-250 Super Duty is offered with three engine choices. The standard power plant is a 5.4-liter gasoline V8 that makes 300 horsepower and 365 pound-feet of torque. An optional 6.8-liter V10 produces 362  and 457 lb-ft. The most popular choice (recommended for those who do serious hauling and towing) is the 6.4-liter PowerStroke turbodiesel V8, which makes 350  and 650 lb-ft. Depending on the model, buyers may also choose between a six-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic and either two- or four-wheel drive.Properly equipped, an F-250 Super Duty can tow up to 12,500 pounds and handle a 3,200-pound payload. Antilock disc brakes are standard, but neither side nor side curtain airbags are available. Power-adjustable pedals are optional on models with automatic transmissions (XL model excluded), as are rear parking sensors. The 2010 Ford F-250 delivers solid ride and handling dynamics for a full-size heavy-duty truck, and it's remarkably quiet at speed, a trademark of recent F-Series models. Its base V8 is still down on maximum power, though, to the tune of 60-80 horsepower compared to the big V8s in the Ram and Silverado. The 2010 Ford F-250 Super Duty trucks feature a blocky, industrial interior design language that works quite well for the intended market. On XL and XLT models, interior materials are quite good for the segment. Higher trim levels and optional packages, with their leather and wood grain trim, add a much more upscale and luxurious feel.The well-placed center stack puts controls within easy reach, while the dual door pockets and a massive center console/armrest provide generous in-cabin storage -- in fact, the center console box is big enough to accommodate a laptop and/or hanging files. The lack of a telescoping steering wheel can make it hard for some drivers to find a comfortable driving position, though. In crew cabs, folding the rear seats up reveals a flip-out utility tray that keeps the load floor flat. Four trim levels are offered: base XL, midlevel XLT, Cabela's (4WD only) and the luxurious Lariat. Regular cabs are available only in XL and XLT forms. The XL is the workhorse of the bunch, with standard equipment that includes 17-inch wheels, air-conditioning, plain vinyl upholstery, a two-speaker AM/FM radio and manual-telescoping trailer-tow mirrors. The XLT adds chrome wheels, keyless entry, power heated trailer tow mirrors, an integrated trailer brake controller, rear privacy glass, cloth upholstery, a 40/20/40-split front bench, a center armrest with cupholders and a storage bin, a tilt steering wheel, cruise control, full power accessories and a four-speaker CD player with an auxiliary audio jack.The Cabela's trim level (named after the outdoorsman retail company) replaces last year's FX4 model and provides much of the same upgraded off-road hardware. This model is only available as a crew cab and includes the XLT features plus skid plates, heavy-duty Rancho shock absorbers, a limited-slip rear axle and a manual-shift transfer case. It also includes dark gray exterior trim, running boards, foglights, a bed mat, power telescoping and folding mirrors, a keyless entry keypad, metallic interior trim, power front bucket seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls and satellite radio.The range-topping Lariat models pile luxury items on top of the XLT model that include 18-inch alloy wheels, running boards, a power-sliding rear window, power telescoping and folding mirrors, leather upholstery, wood grain interior trim, dual-zone automatic climate control, dual power-heated front seats, a center console, rear parking sensors, an auto-dimming rearview mirror and Ford's Sync multimedia voice control system.Most features on the higher-spec trim levels are available as options on the XL and XLT models. Other options (depending on trim level) include a spray-in bedliner, a flip-down tailgate step, a rearview-mirror-mounted back-up camera display, a sunroof, a navigation system, upgraded audio systems, power-adjustable pedals, and a rear-seat entertainment system. Also offered is some very slick high-tech ""Work Solutions"" gadgetry for work-focused trucks, like an in-dash computer and ToolLink -- an RFID-based system that keeps an inventory of tools that are removed from the bed.A few options packages concentrate mostly on appearance and accommodations, of which the Harley-Davidson and King Ranch are most notable. The Harley-Davidson package (only available on diesel models) slaps on a long list of Harley-branded exterior and interior trim, lots of chrome exterior treatments and 19.5-inch polished alloy wheels. The King Ranch package provides two-tone paint, fancy leather seating and western-saddle-inspired trim.

For starters, it offers a stunningly crafted and artfully  finished interior with a suitably big rear seat. The LS also hovers down the  road with a ride so smooth that it can feel like it's riding on clouds.  The  LS comes with most of the in-car technology we expect in a premium luxury  sedan. Apple CarPlay smartphone integration is standard, as is a Lexus+Alexa  app that delivers the voice-activated features of Amazon's Alexa into the LS  500h. Lexus' infotainment interface, however, is problematic. Many of the car's controls are  buried within the infotainment system's complex menu structure, and the  toucad controller is hard to use while driving.  The  LS 500h has one of the most complex transmissions sold today, and its  occasionally ill-timed shifts aren't befitting of a luxury car. We prefer the  regular LS 500 in this regard. Overall, though, the LS 500h is worth checking  out if you want a smooth-riding luxury sedan that also gets high fuel economy.  The LS 500h comes with most of the standard equipment we expect in a flagship sedan. Several packages are offered to add to its amenities, however. If the LS' 16-way power-adjustable front seats aren't enough for you, then the 28-way seats offered with any of the three primary option packages should suffice. We also recommend getting the Safety System+ A package for its enhanced adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking systems.",V6 cylinder ,170,,rear wheel drive , Electrically variable-speed automatic

When Chevy dealers received a brand-new, full-size van to sell in 1996, it marked the first time in 25 years that GM had completely redesigned its big vans. The Chevy Express Cargo comes standard with lots of space, dual airbags and four-wheel antilock brakes. And it can be equipped with a variety of powerful engines. With this modern design and body-on-frame construction, Chevrolet is stealing some of Ford's thunder in the full-size van market.Because most full-size vans are bought for conversion into rolling work stations, engineers decided to put the Chevy Express on a full-frame platform for improved stability. Regular-length models carry 267 cubic feet of cargo, and extended-length vans can haul 317 cubic feet of stuff. Trick rear doors open 180 degrees to make loading and unloading easier. For convenience, the full-size spare is stored underneath the cargo floor. A 31-gallon fuel tank keeps this thirsty vehicle from frequent fill-ups, but topping off an empty tank will quickly empty your wallet. Engine choices are sourced from the Chevrolet family of Vortec gasoline motors, or if you prefer, a turbocharged diesel. The Vortec 4300 V6 has been updated for 2000 to provide quieter operation, reduced emissions and improved durability. Other power plants include the 5000, 5700 and 7400 V8s, and a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8. Standard side cargo doors are a 60/40 panel arrangement, but a traditional slider is a no-cost option on 135-inch wheelbase vans.Only basic amenities are provided as standard on cargo models. These include full instrumentation, a single power outlet, an AM/FM stereo and ABS brakes. The optional equipment list includes all the usual upgrades that most passenger vans come with like front and rear air conditioning, a CD stereo and power door locks and mirrors. Exterior styling is an interesting mix of corporate Chevrolet, Astro Van and old Lumina Minivan. We'll admit the high, rear pillar-mounted taillights are odd looking, but at least they're functional. They can easily be seen even if the van is operated with the rear doors open. Low-mounted bumpers and moldings make the Chevy Express look much taller than it is. An attractively sculpted body side gives the van's smooth, slab-sided flanks a dose of character, as does the quad-lamp grille arrangement.Overall, Chevrolet's latest rendition of the traditional full-size van appears to be right on target, giving Ford's Econoline its only real competition.",V6 cylinder ,160," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

A comfortable, though pasteurized, full-size sedan. It would seem buyers of full-sized sedans generally aren't interested in character. Most big four-doors are dull pieces of machinery to look at and a snooze to drive. The beauty in such a vehicle lies in what it can do for the customer in terms of providing space for people and things without compromising the ride or occupant comfort. It should look upscale, but not gaudy, providing just enough glitz and luxury to let others know you have achieved a degree of success in life. Finally, such a vehicle must also be reliable and able to handle years of daily-driver tasks without so much as a whimper. Since its introduction in 1995, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description: bland as egg whites, but solid, roomy, and dependable. Last year, the Avalon was redesigned. Substantial changes improved its already attractive qualities, but its mission in the grand scheme of things, ersatz Buick, remained the same.   There are two models to choose from: XL and XLS. The main difference between the two is the level of standard equipment, with XLS representing the more luxurious version with JBL audio, programmable HomeLink remote system, remote keyless entry, and aluminum wheels. Either can be ordered with front bucket or bench seats trimmed in available leather upholstery. Avalon's 3.0-liter V6 engine features a variable valve timing system (Toyota calls its system VVT-i). It provides additional horsepower, improved fuel economy and torque, lower emissions and smoother shifting. The previous Avalon was no slouch in the power department, so the recent engine improvements are icing on an already refined cake.Toyota also updated the styling. A side benefit of this is a reduction in noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), not that it was a substantial problem in the first place. There's also increased trunk volume, grocery bag hooks, and a larger storage tray and cargo net. Vehicle Skid Control (VSC), which includes traction and stability control systems, can be added to Avalon XLS. VSC utilizes the braking system to correct understeer or oversteer conditions in a turn. Traction control reduces tire slippage during acceleration. Avalon also features a brake-assist system that detects emergency braking and applies supplemental line pressure to reduce stopping distances. Other safety features include a body structure that effectively absorbs and diffuses energy along predictable paths, energy-absorbing material in the roof rails, front pillar and center pillar to help reduce potential head injury, and super-sized rearview mirrors. With Avalon, Toyota meets and exceeds the full-size sedan buyer's expectations. Sure, the price is higher than offerings from Detroit like the Buick LeSabre, Chrysler Concorde and Mercury Grand Marquis.  But unflappable quality doesn't come cheap.

Like with wine, for instance, or the stuff featured on PBS'  Antiques Roadshow. But for the Volkswagen Passat, age seems to be a liability.  The 2021 Passat is based on the fourth-generation model that debuted nearly a  decade ago. Consequently, it's slowly fading into the background of the midsize  sedan class.  
On  the upside, the Passat still has a few solid attributes such as a smooth ride  and a roomy rear seat. But rivals such as the Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata and  Kia K5 have newer technology features, fresher styling and additional engine  options that the Passat lacks. So is the Passat right for you? Check out our  Expert Rating below to read our full in-depth evaluation.   We  think the midlevel SE trim  represents the best version of the Passat. With extras such as a sunroof,  simulated leather upholstery and extra USB ports, it offers a nice step up from  the base S model without adding much to the price. How does the Passat drive? It's acceptable but nothing exceptional. The engine lacks punch, making the Passat one of the slowest vehicles in its class. And unlike much of the competition, there's no optional engine to improve performance. There's a delay when you step on the gas, and the transmission is eager to upshift, furthering the sense that there's just not much sizzle here. The Passat feels sluggish when passing on the highway. 

   Another issue is braking performance. In our testing we found the Passat's panic-stopping distances to be longer than average for a midsize sedan. An uneven pedal response makes coming to a smooth stop somewhat frustrating too. The situation is a little better when the road bends. Around turns, the Passat is smooth and composed. The steering lacks feedback, but it's light and quick, making it relatively easy to park and maneuver in tight spaces. How comfortable is the Passat? Volkswagen errs on the side of plush. It delivers on comfort with a smooth ride that tunes out most imperfections in the road. Some drivers may prefer a firmer and sportier ride, but the Passat is plenty comfortable for the daily drive. The wide and supportive front seats help too. You might want more substantial padding from the Passat's seats, but the ""relaxed-fit"" shape still does a decent job of keeping you planted around turns. 

   The dual-zone climate control works great, with powerfully cold air conditioning and vents for rear passengers. The fans can be on the loud side when cranked up, but not obnoxiously so. Otherwise the Passat is relatively quiet with just a bit of tire noise on uneven surfaces. How’s the interior? The Passat wins big on interior space, with plenty of room for both front and rear occupants. Legroom is particularly generous, except the center console can rub on the driver's knee. The long doors make getting in and out a breeze, though it might be tight in narrow parking spots. The seat and steering wheel offer a good amount of adjustment, a boon for both short and tall drivers. Decently sized windows and narrow roof pillars make it easy to see out of too.

   The controls aren't as well sorted. While there are dedicated physical buttons for the climate system and shortcuts to the major menus for the touchscreen, the display itself is low and partially blocked by your hand when driving. It also forces you to take your eyes off the wheel for longer than we'd prefer. That said, the system infotainment system is easy to use. The menu structure is straightforward and easy to figure out without pulling out the manual. How’s the tech? The Passat offers a decent amount of tech including standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Integrated navigation is only available on the top-tier R-Line trim. It's easy to program and has on-screen controls that hide when you don't need them. Volkswagen also allows you to connect to your smartphone to check the fuel level or remotely start the car. We also like the Fender audio system's clean and bassy sound. Only lackluster voice controls hold it back.

   The driver aids work well, with the adaptive cruise maintaining a decent gap in traffic and holding speeds downhill. The blind-spot monitor works well too, but the overly sensitive parking sensors were annoying. We also had an issue with the backup camera not always turning on. How’s the storage? The Passat's trunk is wide and deep, and the 60/40-split folding rear seat goes flat, opening the space up further for large items. Up front, there are a few sizable bins and cubbies on the dash and in front of the shifter for small items. The doors have decent-size pockets for most water bottles. 

   Installing a car seat is relatively easy thanks to wide door openings, a big back seat and easily accessible LATCH anchors. Even larger rear-facing seats should fit fine without sacrificing front-seat room. How’s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates the Volkswagen Passat will get 28 mpg in combined driving (24 city, 36 highway). That's decent but behind the class leaders by a few mpg. That said, we saw 30.9 mpg on our 115-mile evaluation route, which is better than we've seen in most of the similarly equipped competition and indicative that the EPA estimates are realistic. Is the Passat a good value? The price of a fully loaded Passat is right in line with the four-cylinder competition, and you get a lot of features and space for the price. The Passat is missing a few features available in the competition such as ventilated seats and a more powerful engine, but for the most part it's a well-equipped sedan. The interior isn't nearly as nice or premium as you'll find elsewhere, but the fit and finish is solid. Our test car had no noticeable build-quality issues.

   Volkswagen's bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranties cover four years/50,000 miles. That's roughly on par with the class. You do get three years/36,000 miles of roadside assistance and two years/20,000 miles of included maintenance. The Passat lacks the charm and personality you'll find in the competition, or even older Volkswagens. VW's been running the same styling theme for a while now, so your new Passat won't look much different than your neighbor's old one. Compared to the Honda Accord, Mazda 6 or Hyundai Sonata, the Passat looks bland and boring.

We knew a styling update would be in the picture for the 2023 BMW 3  Series and feared the beaver-toothed grille from the 4 Series and M3/M4 would  transition to the mild-mannered luxury sedan, too. Thankfully, BMW hasn't  fussed with the exterior too much — the grille is slightly wider than  before, the headlight cluster no longer has the little notch in the middle, and  the front and rear bumpers feature sharper angles, giving it a more modern  look. 
There  are significant changes to the interior, however. For starters, the 12.3-inch  digital instrument panel and central touchscreen now share a singular curved  housing running BMW's latest iDrive 8 software. The new software makes the BMW  Intelligent Personal Assistant smarter, with improved natural language voice  recognition and additional features, including the ability to open and close  the windows or the sunroof through verbal commands. Finally, the central screen  is upgraded to measure 14.9 inches — nearly double the size of the  previously standard 8.8-inch screen — and once again offers touch  functionality. 
BMW  has also streamlined the center stack control layout. There are almost zero  dedicated physical controls for the climate system. Instead, these functions  are moved to the touchscreen in a climate menu, though the driver and passenger  temperatures are always displayed. We're not huge fans of making  attention-sapping touchscreens even more convoluted, but at least you can use  the car's voice recognition system to change the temperature. The useful set of  eight preset buttons, which can be configured for anything from radio stations  to navigation destinations and specific menus, also disappears. Lastly, the  shift lever has been replaced by a toggle switch. 
All  these changes make for a compelling entrant into the compact luxury sedan  segment, but the 3 Series will face stiff competition from the redesigned  Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the stylish Audi A4 and the up-and-coming Genesis G70.  Read on for our thoughts on how the updated 3 Series fares. If  you have a spot to plug it in, the BMW 330e is our recommendation. It's price isn't much higher than the base 3 Series, yet  it comes equipped with a plug-in hybrid powertrain supplying an estimated 23  miles of pure electric driving before switching to gas-electric hybrid  operation. And models manufactured in North America may qualify for a federal tax credit and potentially other incentives  (for new-car buyers); these incentives could actually make it the least  expensive 3 Series.",Inline 4 cylinder ,104," 310 lb-ft @ 1,450 ",rear wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

All 2000 Ford Ranger models have new wheel designs, and the XLT 4WD Off-Road Group receives a stainless-steel front-suspension skid plate. Despite its substantial age, the 2000 Ford Ranger is still one of the wiser choices in the compact truck market. Whether it's image or utility that attracts you to a compact truck, Ford stands ready to seduce you into its strong-selling Ranger. The standard engine on 2WD models is Ford's 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. A 3.0-liter flexible-fuel V6 is standard on 4WD models, and a 4.0-liter V6 is available on all models. With the larger V6, acceleration is impressively brisk, especially from a standstill or when merging and passing.  This engine is available with a five-speed automatic transmission. Its upshifts are crisp and barely noticed, with just a slight jolt under hard throttle, and downshifts deliver only slightly more harshness.  Push-button four-wheel drive, if installed, is a snap to use.Well-controlled overall, with good steering feedback, Rangers handle easily, corner capably, maneuver neatly, and stay reasonably stable on curves.  Occupants aren't likely to complain about the ride, either, though it can grow bouncy around town.  Gas mileage isn't the greatest with the big engine and automatic. The four-door SuperCab -- available in 2WD and 4WD -- makes it easy to access the storage compartment from either side of the truck, a big assist when loading cargo and gear. The optional rear doors hinge off the corner pillars of the cab and swing out 90 degrees from the doorsill. There are no B-pillars to obstruct loading.Completing the Ford Ranger pickup line are regular cab, short- and long-wheelbase 2WD and 4WD models. The Ranger is equipped with dual airbags and side-impact protection beams. The rear doors for 2WD and 4WD SuperCab models also have side-door intrusion beams for extra safety protection. Four-wheel ABS is optional. The optional suspension package for 2000 2WD Rangers is called the XL Stance package. It includes the 3.0-liter flexible-fuel V6 engine, and Ford hopes to attract Ranger buyers who want that 4WD look, but don't need the off-road capabilities.The 3.0-liter flexible-fuel V6 can burn 100 percent unleaded gasoline, E-85 (ethanol) or any combination of the two, meaning owners can fuel up on E-85 whenever it's available. When E-85 is unavailable, regular unleaded gasoline can be used with no detriment to performance. Ford's Ranger continues to be available as an Electric Vehicle (EV). Qualifying as a Zero-Emissions Vehicle (ZEV), Ranger EV is based on the regular cab, 112-inch wheelbase model. Ford has had the best-selling small trucks in the country for years. Fun to drive, sharp looking and well built, the Ranger delivers a solid compact-pickup experience.

For '99 the Super Duty is available in Regular Cab, four-door Super Cab or Crew Cab models, as well as in a class A Motor Home Chassis model. Commercial/small business demand is one of the fastest growing segments in the expanding truck market. Ford has acknowledged the need to create a special utility vehicle aimed squarely at these customers in creating the new Super Duty F-Series. This line of trucks can be had in one of 44 configurations, 21 of which are new. By using a separate platform from the smaller F-150 and F-250 trucks, Ford hopes to meet all the needs of both the personal-use and commercial-use markets.The 1999 Super Duty F-Series trucks feature a 5.4-liter Triton V8 making 235 horsepower and a 6.8-liter Triton V10 making 275 horsepower. Both of these powerplants are new to the lineup and compliment the existing 7.3-liter Power Stroke diesel engine. The diesel has also been updated for '99 and makes an impressive 235 horsepower and 500 foot-pounds trailer-towing torque. All three engines offer more horsepower, higher torque and better fuel economy than the engines they replace.The Super Duty's new body style incorporates a larger cab and an overall length increase of nine inches over last year. The wheelbase is also up by four inches and the cargo area has grown slightly taller and longer. The increased dimensions allow the various cabs to be made larger without compromising load space. Despite its larger size, the Super Duty maintains a confident on- and off-road feel. The new truck features an updated power steering system and enhanced suspension components to improve vehicle ride, handling, responsiveness, and maneuverability. Four-wheel disc brakes are standard and four-wheel antilock brakes are standard on all Super Duty models over 10,000 pounds GVW (ABS is optional on the smaller Super Duty trucks).Inside, the roomier cabs have larger, more comfortable seats and greater seat track travel. In addition, there are many interior convenience features designed for today's stylish business owners. For example, a fold-down armrest and utility bin is designed to house a portable fax machine or laptop computer. In the Crew Cab XLT and Lariat models, a new rear bench seat incorporates a fold-down armrest and a cupholder. For truck owners who don't want to skimp on luxury, leather seating, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, air conditioning and power windows are just some of the many options available.The Super Duty F-Series isn't for everyone.

Toyota,toyota rav4-prime,2021,toyota rav4-prime 2021,"['42 miles of electric-only driving range', 'Impressively quick acceleration', 'Comfortable and quiet ride', 'Generous cargo and passenger space']","['Very low handling capabilities', 'Longer-than-average braking distances', 'Disconnected steering feel', 'Uncomfortable front passenger seat']",4.5,"Toyota  has been applying a ""Prime"" moniker to its Toyota Prius for a few  years now. That plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version of the Prius has a slightly  higher price and a somewhat bigger battery that enables 25 miles of electric  driving before the engine comes to life. It's sensible — if you can  plug it in and recharge it nightly — but that's about all. The 2021  Toyota RAV4 Prime shares that nondescript suffix, and perhaps unfortunately so.  This is a much more interesting and more compelling plug-in hybrid than the  Prius Prime. 
The  reason why boils down to two points. The RAV4 Prime's battery is significantly  bigger, and that gives this small SUV an estimated all-electric range of 42  miles. That's a truly useful number that will cover most daily commutes  — especially when you know you can safely run it to zero and let the  gasoline engine seamlessly keep the party moving. On top of that, the RAV4  Prime has bigger electric motors that make it significantly quicker than any  other RAV4. Or just about any other small SUV for that matter.
Even  with 302 horsepower, the RAV4 Prime isn't particularly fun to drive. But it is  a compelling plug-in hybrid that delivers exceptional economy and practicality. Consider  sticking with the SE to maximize the  RAV4's affordability. The XSE has more standard features — and offers  optional features you can't get on the SE — but none of them are  must-haves. You get the same fuel economy and performance with either trim  level. How does the RAV4 Prime drive? The RAV4 Prime gets up to speed much better than its standard or hybrid siblings. In Edmunds testing it reached 60 mph in an impressively quick 5.6 seconds. The regular RAV4, for example, needs a comparatively unhurried 9.1 seconds. The RAV4 Prime is also smooth and easy to drive under typical commuting conditions. 

   Unfortunately, Toyota has failed to back up the muscular powertrain with any sort of dynamic athleticism. Handling is pretty abysmal, with prevalent body roll and vague steering that makes it hard to judge the right amount of input. The electronic driver assistants also freak out at the smallest provocation. Another demerit comes from the brakes. The RAV4 Prime's pedal feel is overly soft. Panic-stopping performance in our testing was below average for a small SUV. How comfortable is the RAV4 Prime? The driver's seat has enough adjustments to allow you to easily find a comfortable seating position. But the front passenger seat has fewer adjustments, which might lead to a few complaints on long trips. The available simulated leather upholstery (Toyota's SofTex) breathes well and is definitely helped on hot days by the available seat ventilation. The rear seats are also praiseworthy for the better-than-average thigh support. 

   The RAV4 Prime's ride quality is biased more toward comfort than performance, delivering a smooth ride over road imperfections. Road and wind noise is abated to pleasant levels, though the gasoline engine sounds unrefined when you're aggressively accelerating. Otherwise, it's pleasantly muted. How’s the interior? The RAV4 Prime gets strong scores here. The controls are well labeled and logically grouped for easy operation. The drive modes don't explain what they fully do (you'll definitely need to read the manual), but every other system is very intuitive. Entry and exit are helped by an ideal ride height and big door openings; shorter passengers can get in easily and taller people won't have to stoop to get in. 

   There is enough headroom and legroom for 6-footers in any seat. Forward visibility is praiseworthy thanks to narrow front windshield pillars, but the side view is obscured by the thick pillar between the front and rear doors. One other gripe is that the touchscreen is too far away from the driver. How’s the tech? The available 9-inch screen makes most infotainment interactions quick, easy and distraction-free. It's quick to react, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included as standard. The size and placement of physical shortcut buttons could be improved for less distraction. The JBL audio upgrade will get you stronger bass and clarity, but it's not all that impressive. 

   Toyota's advanced safety features generally function as they should. We're especially fond of the traffic-adaptive cruise control that proves its worth whether you're on a free-flowing highway or stuck in traffic. But the lane-keeping assist feature tends to add too much steering effort for anything but straight highway cruising. How’s the storage? The RAV4 Prime takes a small hit when it comes to cargo capacity, accommodating 33.5 cubic feet as opposed to the standard RAV4's 37.6 cubic feet. Still, there's plenty of space for all your luggage, and you can fold the rear seats down with minimal effort. Interior storage is helped by some extra shelves cut into the dash, a wireless charging pad, and a good-size center armrest bin. 

   Parents with young kids will appreciate the RAV4. It's easy to locate and connect safety seats to the lower car seat anchors. Likewise, tethering to the three upper anchors is straightforward. Forward-facing seats and boosters fit readily, but installing a rear-facing infant seat on the passenger side will likely require scooting the front seat up. The too-high front passenger seat is the issue. How’s the fuel economy? On our standardized evaluation route, the RAV4 Prime easily logged 48 miles of electric-only propulsion (6 miles better than the EPA estimate). That's enough to cover most people's average commute and daily driving. Once the gas engine kicked in, we averaged about 34 mpg, which is similar to the RAV4 Hybrid. You can also likely drive nearly 600 miles with a full tank of gas and fully charged battery. Is the RAV4 Prime a good value? The RAV4 Prime is quite a bit more expensive than the regular RAV4. It will take a while to recoup the cost of a Prime compared to buying a regular RAV4 Hybrid based on gas savings alone. 

   The Prime's build quality is good enough to justify the price, and some nice touches are exclusive to this plug-in hybrid model. The warranty for hybrid components is extended past Toyota's usual coverage. Two years of free scheduled maintenance is also included. As disappointing as the RAV4 Prime may be when it comes to performance and driving entertainment, it's an admirable plug-in hybrid SUV. Its easily achieved 42-mile EV range almost doubles that of its closest rivals (Kia Niro and Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV). It certainly doesn't hurt that it gets up to highway speeds quickly, and the sharp styling might attract shoppers away from the less traditional competition.",Inline 4 cylinder ,248,,all wheel drive , Continuously variable-speed automatic

The S4 Avant debuts for 2001, allowing for more cargo space and family-hauling capabilities. Casablanca White is made available as an exterior color, as are aluminum mirror housings in combination with the Pearl Nappa/Alcantara sets and aluminum trim. A new 4-year warranty concept is introduced this year. Softer than BMW's M3, the twin-turbo, all-wheel-drive S4 Sedan and Avant are still strong players among high-performance sedans and wagons. Although not cheap by any means, the S4 does offer a mouth-watering array of features and improvements over the regular A4 Sedan after which it is modeled.Starting things out is a 2.7-liter, twin-turbo V6 engine. Sporting twin intercoolers, dual-overhead cams, five valves per cylinder, variable valve timing for the intake camshaft, and optimized combustion chambers, the engine generates 250 horsepower and 258 foot-pounds of torque. Audi has designed the engine to provide much of its power low in the revband. Consequently, the S4 makes quick work of freeway on-ramps and passing maneuvers. Audi gives buyers of the S4 a choice of transmissions; there's a six-speed manual transmission or a five-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission.All S4s come with Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system, which constantly monitors the grip of the tires. When one of them starts to lose traction, the quattro system automatically applies power to the tires with the most adhesion. Audi says this latest edition of the quattro all-wheel-drive system is capable enough to allow the car to get underway even when only one wheel has reasonable traction. An S4 Avant is made available for 2001, replete with the 2.7-liter, 250 horsepower, V6 Bi-turbo engine, and such niceties as a retractable luggage cover, retractable dividing cargo net and aluminum-finish roof rails. It's perfect for anyone who needs utility but refuses to give up stellar sport-sedan performance.The suspension and braking components of the S4 are well tuned. Major items of note are performance-tuned shocks and springs, and unique 17-inch wheels with 225/45R17 tires. This year, the S4 Sedan gains the Electronic Stabilization Program as standard equipment.The interior retains the same architecture found in the A4, which means an attractive design and an adequate number of features. Special leather upholstery covers standard power seats, and contrasting color suede inserts can be had when ordering the sport interior package. Other options to consider include a sunroof, heated front seats, a six-disc CD changer, and a Bose premium audio system. For safety, there are standard front and head-mounted airbags.Outside, the S4 differs from regular A4s (not that the A4 is exactly regular, of course) by having the aforementioned 17-inch wheels, larger front air-intake openings, and S4 badging. The S4 driving experience is a pleasure. The S4 is softer than a BMW M3, but its forgiving nature comes at the expense of pure handling excellence. Taken as a whole, however, we think the 2001 Audi S4 is quite the contender in the sport-sedan market.",V6 cylinder ,157," 258 lb-ft @ 1,850 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed shiftable automatic

The high-level Yukon Denali is now based on the redesigned Yukon introduced last year. The Denali gets a 6.0-liter engine along with standard all-wheel drive and a host of other new features designed to elevate the top-of-the-line GMC above and beyond its more basic Yukon cousin. A strong drivetrain, well behaved road manners and a spacious and comfortable interior makes the Yukon one of the best full-size sport-utilities on the market. After undergoing a complete redesign last year, the GMC Yukon has become one of the most popular full-size SUVs on the market. With a spacious interior that has legitimate room for seven, strong V8 engines that provide ample power, and a truck-derived chassis that assures long lasting durability, the Yukon is a versatile package that appeals to active-lifestyle families that need a little bit of everything from their family truckster. Yukon buyers can choose between two different trim levels: base SLE or uplevel SLT.  SLEs come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 rated at 275 horsepower, front and rear air conditioning, aluminum alloy wheels, and deep tinted glass. Add to that power windows, locks and doors, a nine-speaker AM/FM CD stereo, and an electrochromic rearview mirror with an integrated compass and it's easy to see why these are popular SUVs.Step up to SLT trim and you'll enjoy leather upholstery, heated driver and passenger front seats with power lumbar and lateral support, electronic climate control, and the OnStar communications system. All Yukons come with four-wheel disc ABS for short stopping distances and a five-link, coil-spring rear suspension that delivers a smooth highway ride. An optional Autoride suspension system varies shock dampening automatically as needed, and 4WD models can be equipped with a Z71 off-road package that includes protective skid plates and a high-capacity air filter. Front and side airbags are standard, and an optional traction control system keeps the 2WD Yukon's tail planted in the slippery stuff.A four-speed automatic is the only transmission available in the Yukon, but an optional 5.3-liter V8 engine is available if you need the extra torque for towing.  Other extra cost items include a power sunroof, locking rear differential, rear-seat audio controls, and polished aluminum wheels. Although hardly groundbreaking on the outside, the luxo Denali features a monochromatic paint scheme and an exclusive polished metal grille that gives it a distinctive, yet understated look.  On the inside, the Denali features a long list of standard features that includes: leather-covered seats, steering wheel and grab handles; a 250-watt 11-speaker Bose stereo system with an in-dash six-disc changer; six-way power driver and passenger seats with dual-zone heating; rear seat audio controls and cupholders; and a multifunction trip computer. The next-generation OnStar communications system is an available option providing not only navigational assistance and concierge services, but also hands-free personal calling and a Virtual Advisor that allows access to Web-based information such as e-mail and stock quotes.Although the Denali coddles its passengers with a luxurious interior, it still packs plenty of high-performance hardware. The standard 6.0-liter V8 is rated at 320 horsepower and 365 ft-lbs. of torque, a step above the Lincoln Navigator's 300  V8.  Power is sent through a heavy-duty four-speed automatic that combines the off-the-line power with the freeway fuel economy.  As if a class-leading engine and versatile transmission aren't enough, the Denali adds the performance and safety of full-time all-wheel drive. This system, in conjunction with a locking rear differential, allocates power to the wheels with the most traction for maximum stability and power in slippery situations. GMC also claims that the all-wheel-drive configuration results in improved driveline durability, better tire-wear characteristics, and a more nimble handling feel.One of the great things about the Yukon lineup is that it gives you plenty of interior room and luggage capacity in a garageable, daily-driver package.  Despite its full-size SUV status, it delivers an enjoyable highway ride while remaining manageable in tight quarters.  With third-row seating, you can have the practicality of a minivan and the go-anywhere capability of an SUV in one easy-to-live-with package.

Limited cargo space in wagon with back seat raised.  No ABS option for L models.'],4.5,"More horsepower, more torque and a more efficient automatic transmission are the big news this year. Multireflector halogen headlights are new and Outback Sport gets a revised grille. The 2.5 RS gets silver alloy wheels, a new front bumper, white gauge faces and more torque, as well as an upgraded leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. Two new colors are available for 1999. Subaru built a solid reputation for itself in the 1970s, building inexpensive (and built to stay that way), four-wheel drive passenger cars.  The company enjoyed success in the Northeast, Rocky Mountains and Northwest, providing people with reliable transportation that could thwart most attempts by Mother Nature to keep them from arriving at their destinations.  Aside from a major rusting habit and offbeat styling, Subarus kept loyal owners happy.Then Subaru decided it wanted a bigger piece of the auto market pie.  The Impreza was originally conceived to battle the Ford Escorts, Toyota Corollas and Chevy Cavaliers that sold so well to young adults.  A zippy ad campaign touting the underpowered Impreza as What to Drive alienated traditional Sube buyers and turned off the young adults it was supposed to attract.  Sales of the Impreza were less than successful, and Subaru scrambled to find a solution.Wonder of wonders, the company decided to reacquaint itself with its legendary all-wheel drive system.  Subaru is emphasizing AWD in every ad, article and brochure you can lay your hands on.  Ah yes, the Beauty Of All-Wheel Drive. The Impreza is available in coupe, sedan and wagon format.  Traditional front-wheel drive editions have been banished from the roster.For 1999, Subaru boosts power and torque in L and Outback Sport models.  The automatic transmission has been revised to operate more efficiently as well.  All Imprezas get multi-reflector halogen headlights this year and two new colors are available.  The Outback Sport has a revised grille.  The racy rally-inspired 2.5 RS dumps its gold alloys for more conventional silver wheels and gets a revised front bumper.  Torque from the 2.5's 2.5-liter flat four is up for 1999, and white-faced gauges lend a sportier appearance to the interior.  New fabric and upgraded leather on the steering wheel and gearshift knob round out the 1999 2.5 RS, a fun car to drive in any type of weather.Lesser Imprezas are a good time, too.  All Imprezas behave like street-legal rally cars, and they're a hoot to toss around.  Fling one into a corner, and it clings to the pavement.  The Impreza is comfortable, though the side glass feels a bit too close.  Steering and braking is communicative.  There is one thing that bothers us about the Impreza lineup, and that's the lack of an antilock brake option on the L model.  To get ABS, you must order the Outback Sport or 2.5 RS.  This doesn't make much sense from a company touting safety in its advertising.Overall, we find much to like about the Impreza.  We've driven Outback Sport, 2.5 RS, and L Coupe models, and thoroughly enjoyed them.  The wagon has a small cargo area when the rear seat is raised, partially due to the steeply raked rear window.  Drop the seat, though, and you've got 62 cubic feet to mess around with.  Other quibbles include a cramped rear seat and ugly, K-Mart issue plastic wheelcovers on the Outback Sport.Subaru is aiming the Outback Sport at consumers who would otherwise be considering a Toyota RAV4, Geo Tracker or Kia Sportage.  Unfortunately, it has trouble delivering what most folks want in a sport utility.  It's not capable of serious off-road adventure, and it doesn't provide a commanding view of traffic.  Cargo volume with the rear seat up can't match the Kia or the Toyota for usability.  However, Imprezas are a blast to drive hard and fast, and the all-wheel drive system performs brilliantly on a variety of road surfaces.What's it cost for a fun car with all-wheel drive peace of mind?  The L coupe starts at $16,400 including destination charges.  Better accommodations will run you as much as $17,600 for an L Wagon with an automatic transmission.  Want ABS?  Plan to spend another grand on the Outback Sport.  Despite the benefits of all-wheel drive, the budget-minded compact shopper must ask whether the price commanded by the Subaru is worth it.  As much as we like the Impreza, we're skeptical.",Flat 4 cylinder ,250," 149 lb-ft @ 3,600 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed manual

A Touring Package is standard equipment on the Corolla LE model. Five new exterior colors include Silver Stream Opal, Venetian Red Pearl, Dark Emerald Pearl, Aqua Blue Metallic and Twilight Blue Pearl. The Toyota Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the second best selling vehicle in the history of automobiles.Last year the Corolla was totally redesigned in an attempt to increase its global sales record and become the standard against which all small cars will be compared. That's a tough goal to achieve with cars like the Honda Civic and Mazda Protege filling this same segment.We think the most exciting aspect of the Corolla is under the hood. Nestled between the grille and the firewall is a 1.8-liter, all-aluminum DOHC four-cylinder engine that cranks out 120 horsepower and 122 foot-pounds of torque. This high-revving engine not only provides the Corolla with more power than the previous generation's motor, but it is 10 percent more fuel-efficient. When glued to a five-speed manual transmission, this engine will reward drivers with 31 mpg in the city and 38 mpg on the freeway.Equally impressive is Toyota's newfound commitment to safety. Beginning last year all Corollas were available with four-wheel antilock brakes and side-impact airbags. Those with kids will be happy to know that CE and LE models can be ordered with an integrated child seat.The car's latest body style is into its second year and we still think the look is attractive but, in typical Toyota fashion, not very exciting. Aesthetics aside, the Corolla's new shape does a good job of reducing the car's NVH level, thanks to flush-mounted side windows and sound-deadening techniques borrowed from the Lexus magicians.

The result is two additional sedan trim levels: 3.0-H6 and 3.0-H6 VDC. Minor upgrades to all trim levels this year include a dome light off-delay, an ignition switch illumination ring and wood grain-patterned door switch trim. Cars with the Vehicle Dynamics Control system now have a button to turn the system off, and sedans receive an internal trunk release. The automatic climate control system is upgraded with an air filtration system. A versatile alternative to mainstream wagons and SUVs. What recipe does an automotive manufacturer use to boost sales? Ask any Subaru executive, and she'll tell you to take one part popular Australian movie star and one part advanced all-wheel-drive system. Stir in an undercurrent of SUV backlash with a dash of resurgence in the station wagon market, and behold: the perfect environment for the Subaru Outback.     Available in either wagon or sedan form, the Legacy-based Outback is Subaru's answer to the question: Why would anyone want to drive an ill-handling, gas-guzzling, difficult-to-park SUV? With standard all-wheel drive, aggressive styling, a heavy-duty raised suspension and a base price in the low 20s, the Outback offers on-road practicality with off-road capability at a bargain price. While no match for the likes of Jeep's Grand Cherokee or Toyota's Land Cruiser in terms of hill climbing, the Outback can hold its own in light off-road situations without losing an oil pan or cracking a differential.Subaru has expanded the Outback's model lineup this year. There are now five different trim levels: base, Limited, H6-3.0, H6-3.0 L.L.Bean Edition and H6-3.0 VDC. Powering the base and Limited models is a 2.5-liter horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine producing 165 horsepower. Power is adequate with this engine, but those planning on frequent hauling of people and cargo will likely want the more powerful 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine. Like the four-cylinder, it's horizontally opposed, and it brews up 212 horsepower and 210 lb-ft of torque. The only transmission offered with the larger engine is a four-speed automatic transmission.The H6-3.0 cars have even higher levels of standard equipment. Highlights include special 16-inch alloy wheels, a limited-slip rear differential, a mahogany wood and leather steering wheel, automatic climate control with an air filtration system, an eight-way power driver seat and a rearseat center armrest. The L.L.Bean Edition, so named because of a marketing partnership with the active-lifestyle clothing maker, comes standard with special two-tone leather seating and a security system. The H6-3.0 VDC comes with Subaru's stability control system, called Vehicle Dynamics Control, as well as leather seating and an impressive McIntosh 11-speaker audio system.Thanks to the AWD system, the Subaru is sure-footed on both dry and wet roads. The H6-3.0 VDC, with its stability control system, is even more so. A tight, responsive steering rack, along with a decent-riding suspension, allow Outback owners to overtake SUV owners quickly when the road gets twisty. In wagon form, the Outback can hold about as much cargo as an SUV; with the rear seats folded down, 68.6 cubic feet of cargo can be stored.In 1999, people complained that the Outback didn't have enough power. So in 2000, Subaru answered with the bigger H6 engine. Problem was, it only came in the pricey L.L.Bean and VDC models. With the introduction of the cheaper H6-3.0 sedan for 2001, it would seem Subaru continues to listen.",Flat 4 cylinder ,200," 166 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed manual

The 2018 Lexus ES 350 is  just that vehicle.  While  the ES 350's pricing is similar to that of other entry-level luxury sedans, it  offers more room and more features than the norm. Top-notch build quality, a  smooth V6 and a plush ride continue to be ES hallmarks as well. Having  said that, the ES isn't a car to excite drivers. Handling is not on par with  that of more nimble competitors. The ES also lags behind rivals in the  infotainment category. But if you're mainly interested in getting a traditional  luxury sedan experience that prioritizes interior space and a quiet cabin above  all else, the 2018 ES 350 will be a great choice. While other manufacturers have branched out to build cars to satisfy fads and trends, Lexus hasn't ignored shoppers simply searching for a roomy luxury sedan. The 2018 Lexus ES 350 is just that vehicle. You'll like its smooth V6, comfortable interior and plush ride. Edmunds has not yet driven a recent ES 350, but we have experience with its cousin, the ES 300h hybrid. While there are differences in the powertrain, comfort and utility sections, the following is our first take on what's significant about it and what you can expect from the ES 350. The ES 350 delivers a comfortable driving experience, bolstered by a smooth and responsive V6. At highway speeds, the cabin is remarkably silent. Bumps and ruts are also nicely absorbed, although the extreme isolation results in a less engaging driving experience. In classic Lexus fashion, the ES exhibits a soft ride quality that diminishes or altogether neutralizes any jitteriness that poorly maintained roads can cause. In testing, we found the heating and cooling for the front seats to be oddly ineffective. We had minor issues getting into and out of the car, but the ES is easy to live with. Highlights include fantastic outward visibility and a spacious cabin. One caveat: We haven't tested an example with the panoramic sunroof, which could impinge on headroom. The standard ES 350 features a 15.2-cubic-foot trunk and a rear seat pass-through (but the rear seats don't fold down). Upfront storage areas for personal items are decently sized. All the latest safety systems are here, but the ES stumbles on other tech fronts. You have to interface with Lexus' app to have access to certain features, and using the infotainment system's mouselike controller takes your concentration away from the road. The standard 2018 Lexus ES 350 has just about everything we'd want in an entry-level luxury sedan. It offers a great combination of features and value. But to really enjoy the experience, you'll probably want to get at least a few extras. We'd opt for the Luxury package (leather upholstery, plus heated and ventilated front seats) and blind-spot monitoring. You'd think the latter would be standard in a car like this, but it's not. Standard  equipment includes 17-inch wheels, LED headlights (low-beam setting only),  automatic wipers, a sunroof, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic  climate control, power-adjustable front seats, simulated leather upholstery and  an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Also  standard is the Display Audio interface (includes an 8-inch touchscreen and  multipurpose control knob), Bluetooth, Scout GPS Link (smartphone navigation),  a USB port, and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player and satellite  radio. Standard safety features include a rearview camera, Safety Connect  emergency communications, a forward collision warning and mitigation system,  adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, and a lane departure warning and  intervention system. Many  options and packages are available, but there are certain package  prerequisites, and availability can vary depending on where you live.The  Premier package adds driver-seat memory settings, a power tilt-and-telescoping  steering wheel, wood trim, and heated and ventilated front seats. The Luxury  package includes the above plus leather upholstery. The Ultra Luxury package  adds the Premium and Luxury packages' equipment plus a panoramic sunroof,  manual rear door sunshades, ambient interior lighting, a power driver-seat  cushion extender and passenger-seat memory functions. Other  notable options include a navigation system, a 15-speaker Mark Levinson sound  system, a power rear window sunshade, a wood steering wheel (with heating, if  desired), bi-LED headlights, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert, and a power-opening trunk.",V6 cylinder ,260," 248 lb-ft @ 4,700 ",front wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

A capable all-weather sedan or wagon for an agreeable price. All-wheel drive is Subaru's mantra, and every vehicle they sell in America comes equipped with it. This includes the entire Legacy lineup of sedans and wagons that offer passenger-car styling with sport utility-like grip in inclement weather. The 2000 Legacy has been improved in several key areas while maintaining its unique position in the automotive pantheon.While not a clean-sheet redesign, enough has changed to call it new.  The sedan lineup now consists of the base L model, the GT and the luxurious GT Limited, while wagons come in value-packed Brighton trim, midlevel L trim, or top-of-the-line GT trim. All Legacys will be powered by a Phase II 2.5-liter, 16-valve, 165-horsepower boxer engine under the hood and the lineup switches from a dual-overhead-cam engine to a single, making the car's performance livelier, thanks to 166 foot-pounds of torque @ 4,000 rpm.  All models come with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.  Additionally, Legacys receive a new body shape and front grille that improves aerodynamics with a low 0.31 coefficient of drag (Cd) for the sedan and 0.32 Cd for the wagon. A hidden tailpipe, standard breakaway mirrors, and improved front and rear cupholders contribute to the new Legacy's appeal.  All-weather packages now include a limited-slip rear differential, the GT gets multi-reflection headlights, and the GT wagon receives a dual moonroof.  New safety features include daytime running lights, front seatbelt pre-tensioners and load limiters, and a three-point seatbelt for the rear-seat center position.  Side-impact airbags are now standard on the GT Limited, Brighton Wagons get ABS with rear drum brakes, and all models except Brighton add rear-seat outboard and center headrests.Structural refinement was also addressed in the latest redesign with an innovative ""Ring-Shaped Reinforcement"" body structure. This design provides greater protection in a wide variety of collisions, including frontal, offset, side and rear. The new body also comes with two safety beams in each front door and one beam in each of the rear doors to further isolate passengers from side-impact collisions.The interior has been revamped as well.  Subaru ditched the tiny stereo buttons that made changing radio stations in the previous model an exercise in microsurgery.  They've also enlarged the instrument panel and relocated the power door lock and window switches to a more user-friendly location on the door panel.  The dashboard, center stack and instrument panel now has an organic flow that moves nicely across the interior, and the quality of the interior materials has been improved.Subaru has a good thing going with its Legacy, which offers a little something for everyone.  Roomy, comfortable, safe and loaded with utility, the model's standard all-wheel drive, along with its many new technical and stylistic innovations, and its reputation for stalwart reliability, should entice you to take a close look.",Flat 4 cylinder ,170," 166 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Toyota,toyota rav4,1997,toyota rav4 1997,,,4.3,"New fabric debuts on the two-door RAV, and a sunroof is finally available on the four-door. Improvements have also been made by using sound-deadening material in the dash area, reducing engine noise in the passenger compartment. The mini-SUV market is booming.  Geo introduced a four-door Tracker this year, Suzuki spruced up the Sidekick with a more powerful engine and body cladding, and Kia dropped a bigger engine and an airbag into its Sportage.  Even the ancient Jeep Cherokee is selling like hotcakes, thanks to its powerful inline six-cylinder engine, low price, and rugged Jeep heritage.Toyota, who in the past half-decade has taken on the luxury sedan market with Lexus, the full-sized pickup market with the T100, and the traditional full-sized sedan market with the Avalon, now has its sights set on wealth-deprived twenty- and thirty-somethings who want an SUV but can't afford to fork out 25 to 30 grand for a 4Runner.  The RAV4 (Recreational Active Vehicle with 4WD) is a new mini-SUV designed to capitalize on the low end of this booming market.All RAV4s are powered by a 2.0-liter, 120-horsepower engine, hooked to either a five-speed or automatic transmission powering the front or all wheels.  The RAV4 is the first sport utility with front-wheel drive.  All-wheel drive models use powertrain components from the now-defunct Celica All-Trac.  Four-wheel anti-lock brakes are optional on all models.  Minimum ground clearance is 7.5-inches on the four-door model; two-door RAV4s get an additional .2 inches.  We haven't driven the RAV4, but gave it a close examination at the Arizona Auto Show.  The four-door is comfortable and typically Toyota in materials and design.  Very functional, little flair, and durable in feel and appearance.  The rear seat is a bit cramped for six-footers, but is comfortable enough for short trips.  Fortunately, the split folding rear seat reclines a bit to increase head room.  The cargo area of the four-door is larger than one would expect, offering more room behind the rear seat than a Chevrolet Caprice Classic.  Two-door models are fine for singles or couples without children.  The rear seat is tiny, and less than 10 cubic feet of cargo volume is available with the back seat up.On paper and in person, the RAV4 is a sensible vehicle with loads of personality.  Pricing, as with many Japan-built imports, is this sport ute's main problem.  A 4WD four-door with automatic, ABS, alloy wheels, air conditioning, cruise, cassette and a tilt wheel is gonna run you $21,750.  Add power locks, windows, and mirrors and the price escalates to $22,700.  In contrast, a Kia Sportage EX runs less than $20,000 similarly equipped.  Loaded Trackers and Sidekicks are also less expensive.  Still, the Toyota is bigger inside, cuter outside, and comes standard with Toyota's reputation for quality.  For many buyers, this will be enough to close the sale.  However, we think the Jeep Cherokee is a better value than any of the mini-SUV's on the market, including the RAV4.",Inline 4 cylinder ,140," 125 lb-ft @ 4,600 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Bmw,bmw x5,2000,bmw x5 2000,"['Rides and drives like a BMW sedan, top safety scores, loaded with luxury.']","['Limited off-road abilities, high price tag.']",4.4,"BMW joins the SUV craze with its all-new X5 SAV (sport activity vehicle), powered by the same superb V8 fitted to the 540i. If you've got too much money and desperately need the SUV image (but don't really care about SUV utility), the X5 will ring your bell. With the success of SUVs in recent years, it was only a matter of time before BMW added their own version to the mix. This year the X5 debuts as the first BMW SAV, or sport activity vehicle. In typical BMW fashion, the German automaker has decided to follow its own path in designing such a vehicle and create one that accurately represents the company's philosophy. What they've come up with is the ultimate, uh, activity machine?Actually, BMW's goal was to design an SUV that performed extraordinarily on every surface. Thus far that distinction would have been reserved for the Toyota Land Cruiser/Lexus LX 470 twins. But with a powerful 4.4-liter eight-cylinder engine, along with an advanced four-wheel independent suspension and electronic wizardry like dynamic stability control the new X5 blows the Land Cruiser into the weeds as far as on-road performance goes.Once into the weeds, however, the BMW's unibody design and refined suspension components are outgunned by the Toyota, Land Rover, and GM luxury SUVs, all of which offer superior abilities when the road gets ugly (or simply disappears). BMW freely admits that the X5 is not meant for extreme off-road adventuring, and we'd advise any potential buyers preparing to drop $50K on one to listen.But BMW knows that most luxury SUV buyers spend about as much time off-roading as they do in the 99-cent store. These customers are looking for a palatial and secure environment to carry them between business meetings and soccer games. Here the X5 scores, with leather and wood grain interior surfaces, a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system, front and rear electric seating adjustments, a navigation system, advanced ABS, rear climate controls, and a total of 10 airbags. Crash testing of the X5 has shown it to set new standards in front- and side-impact protection. From a pure safety standpoint, contends BMW, the X5 is unmatched by anything currently available.Exterior dimensions for the X5 put it at roughly the same size as the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Its short overhangs and compact size (it's 4.5 inches shorter than a 5 Series sedan) add to the SAV's maneuverability claims. Of course it still features the BMW styling cues we've come to expect, including a twin kidney grille, quad headlights and L-shaped taillights.The X5 is produced at the Spartanburg plant in South Carolina and will be initially available with the 4.4-liter eight-cylinder engine. Performance from this engine is brisk with a sub-8-second zero-to-60 time. A six-cylinder model will appear in the not-too-distant future and we're certain an M-badged X5, similar in philosophy to the Mercedes ML55, is in the works. Until then, we'll try to get used to the idea of a BMW SUV while simultaneously preparing our automotive psyche for a Porsche-badged utility vehicle in the near future.",V8 cylinder ,148," 324 lb-ft @ 3,600 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed automatic

Powerful engines and some unique features make the Savana (and its twin, the Chevrolet Express) pretty much the only game in town if you're looking for a full-size van that doesn't look and drive like it was designed two decades ago. Originally introduced in 1965, Chevrolet's full-size cargo van has since undergone only one complete redesign. Constant improvements throughout the '70s, '80s and '90s kept it somewhat up to date, but not until a full redesign in 1995 did the Savana become a legitimately modern vehicle. A new exterior look, new engines, extended-length body styles and improved ergonomics made the Savana hard to overlook when compared with the aging Econoline from Ford. The latest version incorporates some significant improvements like four-wheel antilock disc brakes and powerful V8 engines that make the Savana safer and more capable than ever before. The standard engine on two-wheel-drive 1500 models is a 4.3-liter V6 rated at 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A 5.3-liter V8, with 295  and 335 lb-ft of torque, is standard on AWD 1500 and optional on two-wheel-drive 1500-series vans. Heavy-duty 2500s come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 rated at 285  and 295 lb-ft of torque. A 6.0-liter V8 rated at 300  and 360 lb-ft of torque is optional on the 2500 and standard on 3500s. Also available on 2500 and 3500 series vans is a Duramax 6600 turbodiesel with 250  and 460 lb-ft of torque. All GMC Savanas come standard with a four-speed automatic. Trailer capacities range from 6,100 to a 10,000 pounds, depending on the model. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes are standard on all models. Light-duty models (GVWR less than 8,600 pounds) feature a front-passenger sensing system that will deactivate the front airbag if it senses a small child sitting up front. Heavy-duty models use a manual airbag deactivation switch for the front passenger. A reinforced frame, larger stabilizer bars, rack and pinion steering (half-ton models only) and an upgraded brake system give the Savana a leg up on Ford's Econoline when it comes to ride and handling. Although the Savana is still far from nimble, its modern running gear makes day-to-day driving a much more enjoyable experience. The brakes require less effort than most full-size vans and its powerful V8 engines really make a difference when it comes to merging and passing. The interior is built for functionality, and while it may not be pretty, it sure gets the job done. The controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver. Available 60/40-split driver-side access doors make it easier for the whole crew to get in and out of the van. The standard wheelbase (135-inch) Savana cargo comes in half-ton (1500), three-quarter-ton (2500) and one-ton (3500) configurations, while the extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available as a 2500 or a 3500 only. Not much comes standard on the Savana cargo; the options list includes typical items like a rear air conditioner and heater, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel, keyless entry and a CD stereo.

The interior is not a bad place to spend time, offering fairly comfortable seating for four adults in the four-door models. The cargo area of the four-door is larger than one would expect, too, offering more room behind the rear seat than a Ford Crown Victoria. Two-door models are fine for singles or couples without children. The rear seat is tiny, and less than 10 cubic feet of cargo volume is available with the back seat up. On the plus side, Toyota does offer the RAV4 in convertible form while Honda's CR-V only comes with a hardtop.We are fond of the RAV4, but there are a number of choices in this growing segment and we can't help but think that the more refined and powerful Honda CR-V might offer shoppers more of what they are looking for in a small truck: power, utility, and value.",Inline 4 cylinder ,123," 132 lb-ft @ 4,600 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

But there's no getting  around the fact that this thing is the equivalent of a centenarian among  today's cargo vans.  
It  hasn't been fully redesigned since the 1990s, and there are no significant  updates for 2020. The lack of innovation shows in both its interior and  exterior styling. The Express uses truck-based body-on-frame construction, so  it lacks the shrinks-around-you feeling of several of today's more modern vans.
From  a familiar workhorse standpoint, the Express Cargo gets the job done. A broad  range of engines — V6, V8 and a diesel-powered four-cylinder  — offers something-for-everyone flexibility and contributes to the  Express' high payload and towing capabilities. But it lacks key cargo van  features such as a high-roof option and available all-wheel drive, so it's hard  to consider the Express as anything but a decent choice for a no-frills  commercial vehicle. With  only one trim (Work Truck) available, choosing the right Express Cargo van will  depend entirely on your needs. If heavy towing is required, get the V8 engine.  And if fuel economy is a priority, consider the four-cylinder diesel.

Variety of body styles and AWD make the Impreza a nice alternative to other mainstream economy cars. The Impreza was originally built to battle the Ford Escorts, Toyota Corollas and Chevy Cavaliers that sold so well to young adults, but a zippy advertising campaign touting the underpowered Impreza as ""What to Drive"" alienated traditional Sube buyers and turned off the young adults it was supposed to attract. Sales of the Impreza were less than successful, and Subaru scrambled to find a solution. Wonder of wonders, the company decided to reacquaint itself with its legendary all-wheel-drive system. Subaru emphasizes AWD in every ad, article and brochure you can lay your hands on. Ah yes, ""The Beauty Of All-Wheel Drive."" This AWD model is available in coupe, sedan, wagon, and Outback Sport format.Two trim levels are offered with the coupe and sedan -- the base L model and the racy 2.5 RS. Inspired by Subaru's success in the World Rally Championship, the 2.5 RS combines the performance and handling of a race car with the comfort and convenience of a modern Japanese coupe. Additional factory options include a short throw shifter, a titanium shift knob, and a strut tower brace to reduce body flex in corners. Normally only available in the aftermarket, these trick options show that Subaru knows who its customers are and how they like to drive their cars. For 2001, the Subaru Outback Sport wagon continues unchanged with its aggressive bi-level spoilers and body-colored side mirrors, door handles and side molding. Antilock brakes are standard. Features unique to this version of the Impreza include a heavy-duty four-wheel independent suspension with 6.5 inches of ground clearance, 205/60 R15 M+S tires, splash guards, a two-tone paint scheme, and a rear bumper step pad. The wagon has a small cargo area when the rear seat is raised, partially due to the steeply raked rear window. Drop the seat, though, and there's 62 cubic feet. However, the Outback Sport's rear seat is cramped for taller occupants. Like most Subarus, the wagon comes with a long list of standard features. Air conditioning, power windows, a 12-volt power outlet in the cargo area, power side-view mirrors, a tilt steering column and a roof rack are all included in the base price.Overall, we find much to like about the Impreza. We've driven the 2.5 RS, the L Coupe and the wagon, and thoroughly enjoyed them. All Imprezas behave like street-legal rally cars, and they're a hoot to toss around. Fling one into a corner, and it clings to the pavement. Imprezas are a blast to drive hard and fast, and the all-wheel-drive system performs brilliantly on a variety of road surfaces. Each Impreza model is available with an $800 automatic transmission but to take full advantage of the 2.2-liter, 142-horsepower boxer engine, (the 2.5 RS gets the bigger 165-horsepower 2.5-liter motor) we prefer the five-speed manual. Interiors are comfortable (though the side glass feels a bit too close) and steering and braking are communicative. There is one thing that bothers us about the Impreza lineup, and that's the lack of an antilock brake option on the L model. To get ABS, you must order the 2.5 RS or the wagon. This doesn't make much sense coming from a company touting safety in its advertising. The Impreza's impressive road manners and clean styling make it an interesting alternative for those looking for something distinctly un-Honda Civic-like. Its full-time all-wheel-drive system also makes it a shoe-in for those needing sure-footed winter transportation. Although we love the performance of the current 2.5RS, buyers might want to think twice about getting one now.

New colors have been added and the OnStar vehicle assistance system debuts as a midyear option. Chevrolet makes a pretty good pick-'em-up if powerful engines are your thing. But it has a ways to go to match the Ford F-150 and Toyota Tundra when it comes to the quality materials and assembly. Now into its third year of the current design, Chevrolet has worked out the Silverado's kinks, earning it a reputation as a fast and comfortable truck.  With class-leading engine power and clean looks, Chevrolet's bestseller promises to further improve its image with innovative features that make it a unique truck in the otherwise bland world of half-ton pickups.  For the first time ever, Chevrolet is offering the PRO TEC truck box on its extended cab 4X4s with the Z71 option.  A factory alternative to an aftermarket bedliner, this all-composite box is 50 pounds lighter than its steel counterpart.  It offers protection from dents and scratches along with superior resistance to corrosion.  The tailgate is also lighter for easier opening and closing while its load-carrying capacity increases to 1,000 lbs. compared to 600 lbs. for the steel version.Several engine choices are available for Silverado, ranging from a 4.3-liter V6 to a 5.3-liter V8.  Most buyers select 4800 and 5300 Vortec V8 engines, generating 270 and 285 horsepower respectively.  Automatics come equipped with a tow-haul mode that improves performance under heavy loads.Holding all this together is a three-section frame that is stiff, light and easy to assemble, giving the big truck a smooth ride and a quiet interior.  State-of-the-art steering, suspension and braking systems help make driving the Silverado a joy. Four-wheel disc antilock brakes are standard, and steering feel is tight for a large truck, thanks in part to the power rack-and-pinion gear on models under 6,400 GVWR. Electronic traction assist is now available for 2WD models for those who don't want the added expense and complexity of four-wheel drive.Inside, Silverado buyers will find logically laid-out switchgear, though the plastics feel like they're sourced from the same supplier contracted by Fisher Price. The cabin is roomy, particularly on extended cab models. Standard rear doors on the latter make entry and exit to the rear bench seat easy, and if front passengers are willing to sacrifice a bit of legroom, the back of the extended cab is quite comfortable. Front seatbelts are mounted to the seats themselves so rear passengers don't need to chop through a web of fabric to get in and out. With its powerful range of V8 engines, terrific four-wheel disc brakes, and legitimate rear seat passenger room, the Silverado should have no problem continuing its success in the highly competitive full-size truck market.",V6 cylinder ,123," 260 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

BMWs are all about performance, but during the last two decades, BMWs have also come to the attention of those looking for prestige.  This last group has had a profound impact on the company's fortunes, making BMW the second-best selling German manufacturer in the United States. Things have changed since 1966, including the name of BMW's smallest line of cars.  Since 1977, BMW has referred to these models as the 3-Series, and for the 1999 model year, the 328i and 323i sedans receive a complete redesign.  Next year, expect the remainder of the lineup to follow suit.                       The coupe, hatchback and convertibles do receive some new equipment for 1999, though. The 318ti Sport comes equipped with 16-inch alloy wheels, 225/50ZR-16 tires, leather/cloth sport seats, sport suspension, M-aero package, leather-covered M steering wheel, shifter and handbrake, fog lights and side airbags.  The 323is Coupe and 323i Convertible get an option change on their Sport Packages, which includes new 16-inch alloy wheels and the M sport three-spoke steering wheel.

A  well-equipped Malibu Premier with the upgraded turbocharged engine is likable  enough. The problem is that any other Malibu trim — which would be  most of them you find on a dealer lot — isn't going to be competitive  against other midsize sedans. The base engine lacks power, and Chevy doesn't  add the latest advanced driver safety aids as standard equipment as most  automakers do these days. The Malibu's interior design and materials could also  use a thorough redo.

The Santa Fe is based on a modified Sonata midsize car platform and is available with either front-wheel drive or full-time four-wheel drive with either a four-cylinder or V6 engine. An impressive combatant in the mini-SUV realm with more cabin room than competing models. Now, if we can only overlook its exuberantly, uh, different, sheetmetal. Hyundai dives headfirst into the teeming SUV pool with the introduction of the Santa Fe, a sport-ute based on the midsize Sonata platform. According to Hyundai, the Santa Fe will combine car-like drivability, steering, ride, handling and braking with a truck-like seating height and profile. An optional full-time four-wheel-drive system can be thrown in to sweeten the deal. What more could the average American consumer want, right?Hyundai's ute will be offered in either front-wheel-drive or four-wheel-drive configuration, in one of three trim levels. The Santa Fe GL with front-wheel drive is the only version with a four-cylinder engine; all others come with a V6. That means you're not likely to find anything but V6 models on the dealer's lot, with GL, GLS or LX trim. That standard 2.4-liter inline four makes 150 horsepower and is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. A four-speed automatic with manual shift mode is optional on the GL, but is better matched to the 180-horsepower 2.7-liter V6. With roughly 3,500 pounds to tug around, neither engine could be called sprightly.Hyundai's ute comes with MacPherson struts up front and a double-wishbone suspension at the rear to ensure a car-like ride. Rack-and-pinion power steering provides sharp response. Sized roughly equal to a Lexus RX 300, the Santa Fe qualifies as a midsize SUV according to our guidelines, but is likely to be cross-shopped against smaller models like the Ford Escape, Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Beyond beefy sport-ute cues like big wheels and aggressive front styling, the Santa Fe is designed to resemble the Tiburon Coupe and the Sonata Sedan. You decide if this was a wise move. The rounded body-side contours, according to Hyundai, recall a desert landscape, thus setting the Hyundai apart from other, more angular SUVs. We can tell you that with a scant 7.4 inches of maximum ground clearance, you'd better be sticking to well-traveled fire roads if you venture off the pavement and into Cactusville.Inside, the Santa Fe offers safety features like second-generation depowered front airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners. Other standard features include alloy wheels, air conditioning, power windows, dark-tinted glass, a CD player and a 60/40 split-folding rear seat. The driver seat has adjustable height and lumbar support for long-trek comfort, and the Santa Fe boasts 29 cubes of cargo capacity with the rear seat in use.All V6 models have four-wheel disc brakes. Mid-level GLS models add oversized foglights, power door locks, cruise control, a first-aid kit and remote keyless entry to the standard equipment list. Leather seating comes with the LX. Options are bundled into packages, forcing buyers to spend more than they want for items like ABS and a limited-slip differential.Naturally, the Santa Fe is backed by Hyundai's excellent 10-year/100,000 limited powertrain and 5-year/60,000-mile limited bumper-to-bumper warranties. Along with a 5-year roadside assistance program, the comprehensive coverage should reassure consumers, still put off by Hyundai's former reputation for shoddy quality, that the Santa Fe will hold up over time.Santa Fe is a big step for Hyundai and should prove popular with budget-minded SUV buyers more interested in a roomy cargo hold and sure footing during a snowstorm than running their own version of the Baja 1000.",Inline 4 cylinder ,401," 156 lb-ft @ 3,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Diesel engines make more power and torque, extended cab models get rear heater ducts, a PassLock theft-deterrent system is standard, 1500-Series trucks get reduced rolling resistance tires and three new colors debut. Second-generation airbags are standard. GM has figured out a way to steal some thunder from the Dodge Ram and the new Ford F-Series.  Their entire line of truck engines is infused with notable horsepower and torque output figures, which goes a long way toward selling the consumer on these aging pickups.Every Sierra gasoline engine, from the base V6 to the king-of-the-hill V8, benefits from Vortec technology which provides healthy power and torque ratings.  For example, the standard 4300 V6 makes an ample 200 horsepower, and the optional 5700 V8 is a much more satisfying powerplant than Ford's new overhead cam designs.  Also available are regular- and heavy-duty turbodiesels sporting 6.5 liters of displacement.  For 1998, turbodiesels are infused with additional power and torque.  All Sierras have four-wheel anti-lock braking.The optional side access panel makes the extended cab model a true family vehicle.  Loading cargo into the rear of the cab is much easier, too.  To qualify for the side access panel, you must order a 1500-series extended cab equipped with SLE or SLT trim and a Vortec 5000 or Vortec 5700 engine mated to an automatic transmission.  In contrast, Ford provides a third door standard on all extended cab models, making life much easier.  And for 1998, Dodge offers optional rear doors on both sides of the truck.Creature comforts aren't forgotten in the Sierra.  Automakers are constantly trying to make their trucks more car-like, so GM has made rear seat heating ducts standard on the Sierra extended cab.  Shoulder belts are height adjustable to fit a variety of physiques, and upholstery choices include leather.  Heck, you'd hardly know this was a truck, especially with the passenger car tires that give some versions of the Sierra a nicer ride and quieter interior.Improvements for 1998 include second-generation airbags for front seat passengers, a standard PassLock theft deterrent system, reduced rolling resistance tires on 1500-series models and three new exterior colors.  An all-new Sierra is due in mid-1998 as a 1999 model, so revisions this year are understandably minimal.Although Chevrolet's own C/K Series garners the greatest amount of publicity, GMC's equivalents are pretty strong sellers themselves.  Sierras, in fact, account for close to half of GMC output.  Americans continue to clamor for burly pickups, whether for their macho image or for real down and dirty work.  Whether you choose a light-duty two-wheel-drive (C1500) or the massive four-wheel-drive K3500 Club Coupe on a 155.5-inch wheelbase, GMC gives both Chevrolet and its Ford/Dodge rivals a run for their money.",V6 cylinder ,135," 255 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

The first-generation Passat never sold well in the United States.  Weak original engine choices, ineffective early marketing efforts, and a muddled brand identity that defeated sales across the board all contributed to this car's seemingly invisible presence in the market.  Of course, the plain-vanilla styling of the original car didn't let the Passat stand out for much recognition other than the lack of a grille on the nose.Volkswagen managed to increase brand awareness, quality and sales during the original model's last few years.  As a result, the first-generation Passat received a good bit of attention from consumers during its final months of availability.  But it was getting stale quickly, so Volkswagen released a brand new one last year for Americans to ponder.Two trim levels are available this year: the high-end GLX sedan and the entry-level GLS, which can be had in sedan or wagon bodywork.  While the GLS sedan can be ordered with an optional V6 engine, the GLS V6 wagon, which was originally offered to support the extra weight of the defunct Synchro option, has been cancelled.  The base GLS, which costs little more than a well-equipped Chevy Lumina, is powered by a zippy 1.8-liter turbocharged inline four-cylinder engine.  Not long ago, we drove a couple of sedans equipped this way, and the cars zoomed to 60 mph quickly when mated to a five-speed manual transmission.  Some turbo lag was evident at low rpms, but otherwise, the engine was perfectly capable of hauling 3,100 pounds of Passat.  Equipped with a Tiptronic automanual transmission, however, the Passat GLS lacked verve around town. Opt for a full-boat GLX and you're buying the top-of-the-line Passat with all the trimmings, at about the same cost as a well-equipped Toyota Camry XLE V6.   Due to the cancellation of Synchro, however, the front-wheel drive GLX will not be available until the spring of '99.VW's Synchro all-wheel drive system, now named 4motion, will not be available on any Passat until the 2000 model year, but consumers may see the cars hitting dealer showrooms as early as the summer of 1999. A runaway success in Europe, the new Passat deserves acclaim.  Based on a stretched Audi A4 platform and using plenty of Audi parts in its construction, the new Passat looks, feels, smells and drives like a more substantial car than its price tag would lead you to expect.Passat's contemporary styling will wear well into the new century.  In fact, we find the Passat's design more pleasing than the similarly sized but more expensive and somewhat avant-garde Audi A6.  Our test Passats drove nicely, were solidly constructed and had great sound systems.  The suspension rolled too much in turns, but otherwise, the car was perfectly suited to both canyon running and grocery shopping with the kids.Volkswagen wants to double Passat sales in the U.S.  After a week with the GLS five-speed, we doubt they'll have trouble.  In fact, a GLS wagon with a sunroof, the all-weather package and an attractive set of aftermarket alloy wheels would be our pick of the litter.  So equipped, it would compete with a well-equipped Ford Taurus SE.  In 2000, when it comes with all-wheel drive, it will compete with the Subaru Legacy Outback wagon, but with better looks and that coveted German handling.  For now, all-wheel drive contenders will be shopping Subaru instead, but the Passat is still a great choice for those who don't need to worry about blizzards or boulders.",Inline 4 cylinder ,190," 155 lb-ft @ 1,750 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Toyota,toyota avalon,1996,toyota avalon 1996,,,4.8,"No changes. With the Avalon, Toyota takes on a traditionally Detroit-dominated section of the marketplace: the full-size sedan.  The last assault Toyota made on a domestic market was in 1993, when the T100 pickup was introduced as an alternative to big trucks from Ford, GM and Dodge.  The 1994 Dodge Ram and the lack of a V8 in the Toyota conspired to keep sales to a minimum.  We think the company has learned something from its experience with the T100.For instance, the Avalon's V6 is a powerful motor, allowing the Avalon to keep up with GM front-drivers like the LeSabre and Bonneville in acceleration, and besting the V8-powered Crown Victoria in the race to 60 mph.  Handling is on par with the Bonneville SSE, and braking is outstanding.Inside, the Avalon is noticeably more narrow than the domestic competition, but six will fit in a pinch when equipped with the optional bench seat.  The rear seat is exceptionally comfortable, offering more leg and foot room than bigger sedans, with good support and a high seating position.Front seats are comfy as well, and face an ergonomically designed dashboard that places everything right where you expect to find it.  This car reeks of quality construction and materials inside and out.  The styling is generic, with oversize headlights and a narrow grille imparting an out-of-balance appearance to the front end.Overall, the Avalon impresses us as an excellent alternative to aging, and aesthetically impaired, offerings from GM and Ford.  Chrysler's LH-Series sedans are a better value, but the guaranteed quality of the Toyota is probably worth the extra couple grand.  One car you ought to look at before you buy the Avalon is the Chevy Impala SS.

Power and torque are up marginally with the base 2.2-liter engine. The 2.5-liter motor (also stronger this year and now available with a manual transmission) is now the only engine mated to the Outback. L models gain cruise control, antilock brakes and power door locks as standard equipment. GTs get a manual transmission, larger tires and revised styling. The Outback lineup is expanded with the introduction of a Limited model, which includes a leather interior, new alloy wheels, fresh exterior colors and wood grain interior trim. Recently, Subaru decided to distance itself from mainstream automakers by emphasizing all-wheel drive models.  A wise move, since loyal Subaru buyers stick with the brand, partially because of the wide variety of AWD models in the company's stable.  In the early 90s, the company attempted to steal market share from Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Mazda.  The campaign failed dismally.These days, Subaru is enjoying rising success in the United States, in part due to consumer awareness of the safety benefits of all-wheel drive vehicles, and in part because of the popularity of the sport-utility vehicle.  In 1996, Subaru introduced a jacked-up, duded-out edition of the hot-selling Legacy station wagon.  Called the Outback, it was sold as the world's first sport-utility wagon.  Evidently, Subaru marketing gurus, like much of the buying public, have forgotten the AMC Eagle Sportwagon of the early '80s.The Outback is leading the way again for 1997.  Subaru has added leather seats, woodgrain trim, and gold badging to this popular wagon, creating the Limited Edition.  All that's missing now is the vinyl woody siding.  All Outbacks are equipped with a 2.5-liter engine this year, including those equipped with manual transmissions.  We've driven the Outback, and were impressed by its on-road handling and off-road capability.  Great family vehicle.  We recommend it.However, we also like the 2.5GT.  Available in sedan or wagon format, the 2.5GT finally gets a much needed manual transmission.  Also new for 1997 is revised styling, more horsepower and torque, and larger tires.  Lesser but still loaded LSi models only come with an automatic transmission, and are more luxury than sport oriented.Bargains can be had in the Legacy lineup.  The L model moves up to fill the gap left by the departed LS model.  Cruise control, four-wheel disc brakes with ABS, and power door locks make their way onto the standard equipment list for 1997.  The real deal is the Brighton Wagon.  With all-wheel drive, an 80-watt sound system, and air conditioning all standard, this wagon is priced much less than most other two-wheel drive wagons on the market.  Add some alloy wheels, and nobody will know it's the cheapest model in the lineup.  Unfortunately, ABS is not available on the Brighton.Subaru has a good thing going with the Legacy, which offers a little something for everyone.

Other newsworthy items include available sunshades for the back doors, as well as optional heated rear seats.  The sport package includes a sport steering wheel, and 16-way power front seats can be purchased.  All X5s come with a self-leveling rear suspension as standard equipment. If you've got too much money and desperately need the SUV image (but don't really care about SUV utility), the X5 will ring your bell. With the success of SUVs in recent years, it was only a matter of time before BMW added their own version to the mix. The X5 debuted in 2000 as the first BMW SAV, or sport activity vehicle. In typical BMW fashion, the German automaker has decided to follow its own path in designing such a vehicle and created one that accurately represents the company's philosophy. What they've come up with is the ultimate, uh, activity machine?Actually, BMW's goal was to design an SUV that performed extraordinarily on every surface. Thus far that distinction would have been reserved for the Toyota Land Cruiser/Lexus LX 470 twins. But with an optional 4.4-liter eight-cylinder engine, along with an advanced four-wheel independent suspension and electronic wizardry like dynamic stability control, the new X5 blows the Land Cruiser into the weeds... as far as on-road performance goes.Once into the weeds, however, the BMW's unibody design and refined suspension components are outgunned by Lexus, Toyota, Land Rover, GM and Ford luxury SUVs, all of which offer superior abilities when the road gets ugly (or simply disappears). BMW freely admits that the X5 is not meant for extreme off-road adventuring, and we'd advise any potential buyers preparing to drop $40-60K on one to listen.But BMW knows that most luxury SUV buyers spend about as much time off-roading as they do in the 99-cent store. These customers are looking for a palatial and secure environment to carry them between business meetings and soccer games. Here the X5 scores, with leather and wood interior surfaces, a sophisticated all-wheel-drive system, front and rear electric seating adjustments, a navigation system, advanced ABS, rear climate controls, and a total of 10 airbags. Crash testing of the X5 has shown it to set new standards in front- and side-impact protection. From a pure safety standpoint, the X5 is truly impressive.Exterior dimensions for the X5 put it at roughly the same size as the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Its short overhangs and compact size (it's 4.5 inches shorter than a 5 Series sedan) add to the SAV's maneuverability claims, but leave a teensy 16.1 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats in their upright position. Of course, it still features the BMW styling cues we've come to expect, including a twin kidney grille, quad headlights and L-shaped taillights.The X5 is produced at the company's Spartanburg plant in South Carolina and comes with either a 224-horsepower 3.0-liter inline six or a 282-horsepower 4.4-liter V8 engine. Performance with the larger engine is brisk, scoring a sub-8-second zero-to-60 time. We're certain an M-badged X5, similar in philosophy to the Mercedes ML55, is in the works. Until then, we'll try to get used to the idea of a BMW SUV while simultaneously preparing our automotive psyche for a Porsche-badged utility vehicle in the near future.

Hyundai,hyundai accent,2001,hyundai accent 2001,"['Smooth and quiet ride, roomy interior, impressive powertrain warranty.']","['Boring styling, lack of horsepower.']",4.2,"For 2001, Accent GL and GS get a more powerful and fuel-efficient 1.6-liter, DOHC inline four-cylinder engine. Despite a great warranty and good build quality, we'd probably tell our friends to get a slightly used Japanese car instead. This may not be the case for long if Hyundai maintains its upward trajectory, though. Hyundai is on a mission to reinvent itself in the minds of the American car-buying public. After a rocky period in the early '90s that had people saying, ""Hyundais sure are inexpensive...and you get what you pay for,"" the company has unleashed several winners in a row. The Elantra offers impressive power and sophistication for its price, the Sonata is a roomy and well-built midsize sedan that undercuts competitors by thousands, the Santa Fe is larger than most mini-utes, if not more powerful, and the Tiburon? Uh, well, the Tiburon is a unique piece of work. Additionally, all Hyundais come with an impressive 10-year/100,000-mile drivetrain warranty, helping instill peace in the consumer's mind. The entry-level Accent is no exception to Hyundai's new rule. Three versions are available. The base L and midlevel GS come in hatchback format while the highline GL model is available only as a sedan. The base engine on L models is a 1.5-liter, SOHC four-cylinder making 92 horsepower. A larger, 105-horsepower 1.6-liter is optional on L and standard on GS and GL. This new DOHC design offers more power and increased fuel economy over the standard engine. An available four-speed automatic performs admirably, but can only be added to the GS or the GL.Under the Accent's attractively creased bodywork sits a MacPherson strut independent front and a dual-link rear suspension. Stabilizer bars at both ends do a poor job of controlling body lean, and skinny 13-inch wheels and tires do little to inspire confidence in Accent's handling. But the use of hydraulic engine mounting means reduced noise, vibration and harshness. Safety features include depowered airbags and seatbelt pre-tensioners. Unfortunately, ABS for the front disc/rear drum braking system is not even available as an option.Interiors feature a modern instrument pod and a clean, simple center stack with straightforward climate and radio controls. Rear seat heating and ventilation ducts help keep backseat riders comfortable and the use of noise-reduction material in the A- and B-pillars attempts to quiet the ride. The driver's seat features adjustments for height and rake, as well as fore and aft settings. Oh, and a nifty fold-down armrest is standard.Standard equipment includes a cassette player, rear defroster, trip odometer, and power steering.  Step up to the GS or GL and you'll receive upgraded carpeting, a digital clock, a tachometer, lumbar support for the driver, a 60/40 folding rear seat, a passenger visor vanity mirror and tinted glass. Upgraded trims also open the door to the few factory options that are available, such as power front windows, power exterior mirrors, air conditioning, and a CD player. Port-installed options on any Accent include carpeted floor mats, a rear spoiler, a center armrest, mudguards and a cargo net for the trunk.Hyundai has made great strides with regard to quality in the last few years and we're gaining respect for its products. In the subcompact world of shoddy Kias, questionable Daewoos and overpriced Toyotas, the Accent has plenty to offer the buyers who must have that new-car smell and new-car warranty. But at a welterweight 2,280 pounds, Accent doesn't offer much crash protection from the hulking SUVs and pickups on the roads.  Our advice?  Spend the few dollars you have on a larger, slightly used vehicle from one of the major Japanese manufacturers.

The GLS gets an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and Limited models can be equipped with an all-black monochromatic color scheme.  The 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe offers a consumer-friendly blend of space, comfort, features, performance and value that make it a compact SUV worth considering. Introduced for the 2001 model year, the Hyundai Santa Fe cuts to the heart of what most American SUV buyers really want -- the ride and handling characteristics of a car melded with the styling and tall seating position of a truck. At the same time, it's big on value. While priced to match compact competitors like the Tribute and RAV4, the Santa Fe is based on Hyundai's previous-generation Sonata sedan platform, which means that it's technically a midsize SUV and accordingly offers more room for passengers and cargo.Like other Hyundai vehicles, this one is packed with desirable standard features and comes with a strong standard warranty. And the Santa Fe's crash test scores have generally been very good. The Sante Fe is now in the sixth year of its model cycle, but Hyundai has made continual improvements over the years to keep it competitive among budget SUVs. Most significant among these was the arrival of a 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission, a combination that vastly improved its acceleration. When equipped with all-wheel drive, this Hyundai SUV can handle well-groomed dirt roads, but it's not a serious off-roader like the Xterra or Sorento. However, we would certainly recommend the 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe to the general consumer looking for a good deal on a family vehicle that doesn't have any serious faults.  The GLS model comes standard with a 2.7-liter V6 rated at 170 horsepower and 181 lb-ft of torque; it's paired with a four-speed automatic transmission. Optional on the GLS and standard on the Limited is a 3.5-liter V6 good for 200  and 219 lb-ft of torque. This engine comes with a five-speed automatic. Both front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive models are available on this Hyundai SUV. Although the smaller V6 is rated for up to 26 mpg on the highway, the 3.5-liter turns in poor fuel numbers for a small SUV application -- just 16-17 mpg in the city and 21-22 on the highway. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes, traction control and side airbags (for front occupants) are standard on all models. In government crash tests, the Hyundai Santa Fe received four out of five stars for driver protection in frontal impacts and five stars for the front passenger. Side-impact testing resulted in a five-star rating for front- and rear-passenger protection. In frontal-offset crash testing conducted by the IIHS, the Santa Fe received a ""Good"" rating (the highest possible); in IIHS side-impact testing, it earned an ""Acceptable"" rating (the second highest). The 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe has just what most family-oriented buyers want: adequate power and a smooth, quiet ride. Its handling capabilities provoke little excitement but unless you're a driving enthusiast, you probably won't mind the soft setup. If you opt for an AWD Sante Fe, you'll have a bargain-priced, all-weather family vehicle.  Inside, the Hyundai Santa Fe offers reasonable accommodations for five and a 29.4-cubic-foot cargo bay; fold down the 60/40-split rear seats, and you get a generous 78 cubes. The cabin boasts a sharp two-tone color scheme and feels high in quality, as Hyundai has fitted it with low-gloss plastics and solid switchgear. The seats are comfortable, but legroom can be a bit tight for adults in back, and unlike the Equinox and CR-V, the Santa Fe doesn't offer fore/aft adjustment for its rear bench.  The four-door Hyundai Santa Fe is sold in GLS and Limited trims. Standard equipment on the GLS includes side airbags; air conditioning; power windows, mirrors and locks; a CD player; 16-inch alloy wheels; a full-size spare tire; an auto-dimming rearview mirror; and foglights. Options on the GLS include a power sunroof and a Monsoon sound system with an in-dash CD changer. The Monsoon stereo comes standard on the high-line Limited, along with automatic climate control, a power driver seat, leather upholstery, heated seats and a trip computer.",V6 cylinder ,250," 181 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed shiftable automatic

The entry-level Brighton coupe is dropped, and the high-end 2.5RS coupe is added.  No depowered airbags here. Subaru built a solid reputation for itself in the Seventies building inexpensive (and built to stay that way) four-wheel drive passenger cars.  The company enjoyed success in the Northeast, Rocky Mountains and Northwest, providing people with reliable transportation that could thwart most attempts by Mother Nature to keep them from arriving at their destinations.  Aside from a major rusting habit and offbeat styling, Subarus kept loyal owners happy.Then Subaru decided it wanted a bigger piece of the auto market pie.  The Impreza was originally conceived to battle the Ford Escorts, Toyota Corollas and Chevy Cavaliers that sold so well to young adults.  A zippy ad campaign touting the underpowered Impreza as ""What to Drive"" alienated traditional Sube buyers and turned off the young adults it was supposed to attract.  Sales of the Impreza were less than successful, and Subaru scrambled to find a solution.Wonder of wonders, the company decided to reacquaint itself with its legend.  Subaru is concentrating on all-wheel drive cars again, and is emphasizing AWD in every ad, article and brochure you can lay your hands on.  Ah yes, The Beauty of All-wheel Drive.  The Impreza is available in coupe, sedan and wagon form.   Traditional front-wheel drive editions have been banished from the roster.For 1998, Subaru bestows a new dashboard and revised door panels upon the Impreza.  Shared with the Forester, the fresh interior bits appear to have been a lateral revision rather than a true improvement. The radio buttons are still too small, and that was the previous car's only real control layout issue.  The  base level Brighton coupe has been excised from the lineup, and the racy 2.5RS has been added, sporting a paint scheme and giant wing spoiler meant to evoke the successful rally cars Subaru sponsors in parts of the world where rally racing is a big deal.  With the Legacy's larger 25-liter 165-horsepower boxer engine,  the 2.5 RS should be a blast to drive, particularly in foul weather.Lesser Imprezas are a good time, too.  You'll keep the zingy 2.2-liter boxer engine revved up.  All Imprezas behave like street-legal rally cars, and they're a hoot to toss around.  Fling one into a corner, and it clings to the pavement.  The Impreza is comfortable, though the side glass feels a bit too close. Steering and braking is communicative.  There is really just one thing that bothers us about the Impreza lineup, and that's the lack of an antilock brakes option on the L model.  To get ABS, you must order the Outback Sport or 2.5RS.  This doesn't make much sense from a company touting safety in its advertising.Overall, we find much to like about the Impreza.  We've driven Outback Sport, 2.5RS and L Coupe models, and thoroughly enjoyed them.  The wagon has a small cargo area when the rear seat is raised, partially due to the steeply raked rear window.  Drop the seat, though, and you've got 62 cubic feet to mess around with.  Other quibbles include a cramped rear seat and ugly K-Mart issue plastic wheelcovers on the Outback Sport.Subaru is aiming the Outback Sport at consumers who would otherwise be considering a Toyota RAV4, Geo Tracker or Kia Sportage.  Unfortunately, it has trouble delivering what most folks want in a sport utility.  It's not capable of serious off-road adventure, and it doesn't provide a commanding view of traffic. Cargo volume with the rear seat up can't match the Kia or the Toyota for usability.  However, Imprezas are a blast to drive hard and fast, and the all-wheel drive system performs brilliantly on a variety of road surfaces.What's it cost for a fun car with all-wheel drive peace of mind?  The L coupe starts at $16,500 including destination charges.  Better accommodations will run you as much as $17,500 for an L Wagon with an automatic transmission.  Want ABS?  Plan to spend another grand on the Outback Sport.  As good as all-wheel drive is, the budget-minded compact shopper must ask whether the price commanded by the Impreza is worth it.

No, the X4 M is about as niche as it gets. With  its original X6, BMW can take credit as one of the first automakers to offer a  coupe-style SUV. The X4 follows the same formula. It's based on the X3 small  SUV but has a sleeker fastback roofline in exchange for less cargo space and  rear headroom. From there, the X4 M gets the full BMW performance treatment  with a 473-horsepower engine, sophisticated all-wheel-drive system and retuned  suspension. On  the road, the X4 M offers an almost unbelievable level of performance and  capability, tackling back roads or highway on-ramps with a prowess that would  have seemed silly just a few years ago. The steering, handling and raw  acceleration are far beyond what most people expect from an SUV. Unfortunately,  those performance capabilities never really settle down, giving the X4 M a  jarringly stiff ride even in its most comfortable setting. Inside,  the X4 M shares much with the more conventional BMW X3 and, by extension, the  X3 M. The rear seats and cargo area are more cramped, but from the driver's  seat you'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the X3 and the X4.  The interior design, features and tech are the same, as is performance. From  a logic standpoint, it makes more sense to buy an X3 M. You'll pay less and get  more practicality as part of the deal. But in the end that's part of the X4 M's  charm. It's clearly not for everyone.  As  great and powerful as the Competition model may be, we suggest sticking with  the standard X4 M.

Chevrolet,chevrolet suburban,1996,chevrolet suburban 1996,,,4.4,"Improved engines generate more horsepower and torque. Four-wheel-drive models get an optional electronic shift transfer case.  Daytime running lights, rear-seat heating ducts and two new paint colors summarize the changes. Gaze down the side of a Suburban and all you see is steel and more steel, stretching rearward.  Hike yourself aboard and you can't help but feel you're in a truck, ready for the long haul--which is exactly what pleases many owners of these biggies.  Compact-vehicle fans have a hard time grasping the appeal, but full-size ""truck wagons"" have been luring more and more upscale motorists.GMC claims this mammoth combines the comfort of a luxury sedan with the ""tenacity and utility of a packhorse.""  Except for the nearly-identical Chevrolet model, also named Suburban and priced just slightly lower, there's nothing else quite like it on the market.For 1996, GMC has reengineered its gasoline V8 engines.  Standard is a Vortec 5700 V8, which has gained 50 horsepower and foot-pounds of torque over last year's 5.7-liter engine.  The big Vortec 7400 benefits from similar power gains.  Long-life engine coolant is installed in both engines, and doesn't need to be changed until the payment booklet is empty.Inside is a driver airbag and a brake/transmission interlock, which prevents shifting out of ""park"" unless your foot is on the brake pedal.  The modern instrument panel holds a selection of white-on-black analog gauges with zone markings and red-orange needles, but we wish it also held a passenger side airbag.  Rear seat heat ducts are new, as is standard illuminated entry.  Climate controls are easy to grasp and use, within easy reach of each occupant.  Dual cupholders ease out of a compartment at the center of the dashboard, and three assist handles help entry/exit.  Four-wheel drive models can be ordered with a new electronic shift mechanism that does away with the bulky shifter in the center of the floor.  Passenger car tires make less rough-and-tumble Suburbans ride more smoothly and quietly.Despite its pickup truck heritage, the Suburban produces a stable and reasonably comfortable, if not exactly cushiony, ride--at least until you stray away from smooth pavement.  Gasoline engines tend to guzzle as expected, and if you're planning to carry heavy loads much of the time, or haul a trailer, give the big-block V8 a whirl before deciding to accept the base engine.Currently, GM owns this niche in the SUV market.

Daytime running lights with auto-off color-keyed foglamp covers and dual heated color-keyed power mirrors are new this year. A new three-in-one ETR/cassette/CD sound system is optional on the XL model and Lunar Mist Metallic replaces Golden Sand Metallic. With the Avalon, Toyota takes on a traditionally Detroit-dominated section of the marketplace-the full-size sedan. The last assault Toyota made on a domestic market was in 1993, when the T100 pickup was introduced as an alternative to big trucks from Ford, GM, and Dodge. The introductions of the 1994 Dodge Ram and the lack of a V8 in the Toyota conspired to keep sales to a minimum. We think the company has learned something from its experience with the T100.For instance, the Avalon's V6 is a powerful motor allowing the car to compete with GM front-drivers, like the LeSabre and Bonneville, in acceleration. Handling is on par with the Bonneville SSE, and braking is outstanding.Inside, the Avalon is noticeably narrower than the domestic competition, but six will fit in a pinch when equipped with the optional bench seat. The rear seat is exceptionally comfortable, offering more leg and foot room than bigger sedans, with good support and a high seating position.Front seats are comfy as well, and face an ergonomically designed dashboard that places everything right where you expect to find it. The styling is generic, with oversize headlights and a narrow grille imparting an out-of-balance appearance to the front end. Of course, if this car is truly trying to compete with domestic sedans, this styling is right on the money.Overall, the Avalon impresses us as an excellent alternative to aging and aesthetically impaired offerings from GM and Ford.

Now with a complete redesign for 2020, this Silverado 2500HD is  part of a modern breed of heavy-duty pickup trucks. Forget the days of  sacrificing ride quality and interior comfort just to pick up some towing  capability — rigs like the new 2500HD can do it all. 
The  2500HD's most significant updates come in the form of new powertrains, a longer  wheelbase and Chevy's newest towing technology features, including an available  towing camera system with up to 15 views. Inside, the Chevrolet Silverado  2500HD is comfortable and spacious, with the truck's increased size  contributing to significantly increased passenger space. The Silverado's  interior looks a little dated, even by class standards, but it's still  functional.
Under  the hood, the Silverado gets a new 6.6-liter V8 as its standard engine. It has  more power and torque than last year's engine, which increases payload and  towing capacity. The optional Duramax turbodiesel hasn't changed, but the  transmission it's paired to has — a 10-speed takes over for the  previous six-speed automatic transmission. This increases the truck's capability  without a need for a power increase. 
The  heavy-duty truck segment is more competitive than ever. Alongside offerings  from Ford and Ram, the heavy-duty Silverado is one of the most capable vehicles  on the road today. We will say that you might prefer the Ram if you want a  truck with a more luxurious-looking cabin. The 2020 F-250 gets a lot of updates  too. But no one truck has a dramatic lead over another, so your final decision  could simply come down to brand loyalty or personal preference.

V6 and V8 engines meet California's low emission vehicle (LEV) standards. If poor visibility, questionable build quality and a cheapo interior don't bother you, the Camaro is as fast as it gets for under $30K. ""From the country that invented rock 'n' roll"" claimed the advertisements for this Quebec, Canada-built sport coupe when it was redesigned in 1993. A small technicality, we suppose, but there are no technicalities when it comes to the Camaro's performance abilities, particularly in Z28 or SS guise. These Camaros are blazingly quick, hold the road tenaciously, cost less than the average price of a new car in this country and get decent gas mileage when they're not being hammered along a twisty, two-lane road.Two trim levels are available for 2000 in either coupe or convertible bodystyles. Base Camaros are powered by a 3800 Series II V6 that makes 200 horsepower. Mated to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission, this sufficiently strong motor makes a strong argument for avoiding the higher insurance rates and prices of the Z28. An optional performance-handling package puts dual exhaust, tighter steering and a limited-slip differential on the V6 Camaro.The Z28 is the go-faster Camaro. Equipped with a detuned Corvette 5.7-liter V8, the Z28 makes 305 horsepower, 45 more horses than the Mustang GT. Opt for the SS performance package and you get 320 horsepower (same as the Mustang Cobra), thanks to forced air induction through an aggressive-looking hood scoop. The SS gets to 60 mph from rest in a little over five seconds. SLP Engineering - known for working magic with GM's F-Bodies since the late '80s - supplies the parts to turn a Z28 into an SS. For 2000, revisions are few.  New interior colors and fabrics, along with steering wheel-mounted stereo controls, freshen the passenger compartment.  Engines meet LEV standards in California and other low-emission states, and one new exterior color is available.  These changes are welcome.  The new, more intricately laced alloy wheels that look like wheelcovers are not.  They look difficult to clean, and those beautiful, fat, five-spokers on the SS have been sacrificed for the sake of change.The interior of the Camaro is functional, but cheap in appearance. Visibility is nothing to brag about either. The Camaro holds a respectable amount of gear in the cargo hold (more than 33 cubic feet of space with the generally useless rear seats folded down), and airbags and antilock brakes are standard.Rumors are flying that GM is set to kill the Camaro, and since no product is scheduled for the Canadian Camaro plant after 2002, those rumors are likely true. Steadily declining sales are to blame, and the company is eager to slice non-performing models from the lineup. If the Camaro dies, it would be a real shame because - from a bang-for-the-buck standpoint - the Z28 is unbeatable. More mature drivers can order traction control, but that option defeats some of the fun of Chevy's pony car: smoky, adolescent burnouts that leave the drivers behind choking on charred Goodyears.",V6 cylinder ,375," 225 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Two special editions are available, the Collector Edition and the Grand Sport. Next year, an all-new Corvette debuts. Other additions for 1996 include a Selective Real Time Damping system for the shock absorbers, and a stiffer Z51 suspension setup. Really, this car needs no introduction.  Existing largely unchanged since late 1983, the current Corvette has been continually improved each year, enough so that it ranks as one of the best sports cars you can buy at any price.  And, compared to most of its upscale competitors, the Corvette offers brash style, performance and image at a relative bargain.The Corvette's styling still seems fresh, even after 13 years in production.  Still, it's been a long time since a thorough redesign, and the Corvette is beginning to show its age.  For 1997, Chevrolet is planning to roll out a new Corvette, and it will likely showcase cutting-edge technology and represent a vast improvement over the current model.To send the fourth-generation Corvette off in style, Chevrolet has developed two special edition models for 1996.  The first is a Collector Edition, painted in an exclusive Sebring Silver color and sporting wheels and tires from the dearly departed ZR1.  Perforated leather seats with ""Collector Edition"" embroidery can be ordered in Torch Red, Black or Light Gray.  Available in coupe or convertible format, the Collector Edition is the best looking Corvette we've seen in some time.More exclusive is the other special edition 1996 Corvette.  Called the Grand Sport in tribute to five lightweight Corvette race cars constructed in the early 60s, this model is painted in an exclusive Admiral Blue Metallic, with a white racing stripe and red hash marks on the front left fender.  Black aluminum wheels, rear fender flares, and perforated leather come with the package.  Only 1,000 examples of the Grand Sport will be produced.Showcasing a new LT4 engine, the Grand Sport's V8 makes 330 horsepower and is equipped with a six-speed manual transmission.  This powertrain is available on all 1996 Corvettes.  Cars equipped with an automatic have the LT1 engine from last year under the clamshell hood, making 300 horsepower.New to the Corvette for 1996 is an optional Selective Real Time Damping system, which adjusts the shock absorbers every 10 to 15 milliseconds to provide optimum control of the vehicle.  Coupes can be equipped with a Z51 Performance Handling Package, tuned for autocross and gymkhana enthusiasts.  We don't recommend this ultra-stiff setup for street use, unless you want to have your dentist refill your teeth every few months.Were it not for the excellent Camaro Z28, we'd recommend the Corvette, but we think the extra 20 grand it costs over the Z car would be better spent on a Jeep Wrangler for weekend treks to the north country and a few coolers full of Killian's Red.  However, most Corvette buyers aren't interested in bang-for-the-buck; they want the name and the styling found on the Corvette.

Floor mats and an AM/FM CD stereo are now standard on all models. Three new colors have been added along with newly styled 15-inch cast-aluminum wheels. Chevy's non-descript Malibu is one of the best cars General Motors makes. Roomy, quick and loaded with features for a low price, it's tough to go wrong with the too-often overlooked Malibu. Chevrolet is trying to claw its way back from mediocrity with cars that provide not only solid performance and good looks, but manage to do so with a low price, to boot. The Malibu is a perfect example of this philosophy, with good looks, a strong V6 and a sticker price that undercuts its foreign competition by hundreds of dollars.Two models are available: Base and LS. Both Malibus feature a torquey 3.1-liter 3100 V6 engine, making 170 horsepower and 190 pound-feet of torque running through a standard four-speed automatic transmission. Standard equipment includes four-wheel antilock brakes, a four-wheel independent suspension, battery rundown protection, theft deterrent system, tachometer, air-conditioning, tilt steering wheel and a remote trunk release. Step up to LS trim, and you leave the showroom in a fully loaded car that includes aluminum wheels, foglights, remote keyless entry, power driver seat, power windows and door locks, cruise control, uplevel stereo and a trunk cargo net. This Chevy goes, slows and turns corners well enough to be entertaining. Thoughtful interior design elements include a handy, albeit shallow, left-handed cupholder, backlighting for major controls and switches throughout the interior, and heating and air conditioning ducts located on the A-pillar to help direct airflow to rear-seat passengers. Also notable is the retro-style, dash-mounted ignition switch, eliminating the need to crane your neck around to find the key slot. Malibu has safety concerns covered, as well. Dual airbags, four-wheel antilock brakes and child-safe rear door locks are standard. According to Chevrolet, side-impact door beams exceed federal standards for protection, though federal side-impact crash tests indicate that occupants may actually be rather vulnerable in this car. Maintaining the Malibu is easy with platinum-tipped spark plugs that last up to 100,000 miles, engine coolant designed to last 5 years or 150,000 miles, and transmission fluid that never has to be changed or checked. Our list of gripes is short. The fake wood in the LS is out of place in a car like this. And why can buyers get traction control on the Cavalier but not the Malibu? The latest list of improvements doesn't address our concerns, so we'll have to wait another year to see if our wish list ever gets fulfilled. Still, the Malibu impresses us. It's one of the few domestic models that can go toe-to-toe with the imports on comfort and features, while beating them on price. Its mainstream styling doesn't scream American econobox, and its long list of standard features won't leave you wishing you had anted up for an Accord or a Camry. If you're in the market for modestly priced midsize four-door, Chevrolet's Malibu is one domestic sedan that deserves serious consideration.",V6 cylinder ,215," 190 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Poised to tackle the best in the class, the Elantra comes well equipped for less than $13,000. Though the useful station wagon model has been stricken from the lineup, a five-door hatchback is set to debut next year. An undeniable bargain at first glance. If the newly redesigned Elantra turns out to be as reliable as Hyundai's warranty suggests, we see no reason to buy the Japanese competition. Already a winner to our editors, the amazingly competent Elantra gets a complete overhaul for 2001, adding interior space and exterior size, along with a full load of standard equipment, without a substantial boost in the price. Stickering for less than $13,000 and sold in a single trim level with a handful of options, the new, more refined Elantra is set to compete head-to-head with the best in the compact sedan class, beating everyone on price if not overall quality.Elantra's 140-horsepower 2.0-liter DOHC engine provides decent acceleration, suffering a bit in terms of performance due to Elantra's weight gain of 300 pounds over last year's model. A four-speed automatic transmission is optional and features fuzzy-logic software to optimize shifting and hold a gear on hills, but we'd go with the less expensive manual transmission to extract maximum acceleration. A four-wheel independent suspension, multi-link with an antiroll bar at the rear, makes for smooth, stable handling, while the speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system communicates improved road feel to the driver for 2001. Four-wheel disc ABS is optional, as is traction control.Inside the Elantra, consumers will find a roomy cabin with supportive, comfortable seats front and rear. Extensive use of sound-deadening materials helps quiet this formerly buzzy compact car. Equipment levels are impressive, with power windows/locks/mirrors, side airbags, air conditioning, a cassette player and 15-inch wheels standard. Options, aside from the ABS and traction control previously mentioned, are limited to a power moonroof, CD player, cruise control and a smattering of port- and dealer-installed goodies.Later this year, Hyundai will introduce the Elantra GT. Configured as a five-door hatchback, the GT is designed to appeal to those who might have purchased the discontinued station wagon model, as well as buyers who desire the utility of a hatchback configuration. The GT gets rear disc brakes, a sport-tuned suspension, alloy wheels, and a host of other standard items for a premium of about $1,000 over the sedan.Elantra also comes with an outstanding warranty. Called the Hyundai Advantage, this buyer-assurance program is a great incentive to buy a Hyundai over one of the many other compact choices on the market. Consumers receive an awesome 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. If the car is sold within those first 10 years, the new owner will still be entitled to the balance of a 5-year/60,000-mile powertrain warranty. Also part of the program is 5-year/100,000-mile corrosion coverage and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty for 5 years or 60,000 miles. Additionally, the program offers free 24-hour roadside assistance for 5 years, which includes towing and lockout service. Attractive, well equipped and backed up by one of the most extensive warranties in America, Hyundai has a winner in the upgraded and redesigned Elantra. Though it likely won't match the refinement or attention to detail found in segment leaders like the Honda Civic and Ford Focus, the savings to be found up front will certainly sway buyers for whom every penny spent up front counts.",Inline 4 cylinder ,200," 133 lb-ft @ 4,800 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

A solid and pleasing package, if a tad bit small. Back in 1996, the term ""cute ute"" was coined when Toyota released the RAV4, an acronym for Recreational Activity Vehicle with 4WD. While Suzuki had been plying these waters for years with the Sidekick (and its Chevy Tracker twin), it wasn't until the car-based RAV hit the market that small SUVs became popular.For 2001, Toyota has redesigned the RAV4. Available in five-door wagon configuration, the new RAV is taller, wider, longer and heavier than the original flavor, which results in more cabin space. To offset the weight gain, a new, all-aluminum, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is under the hood, mated to either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic driving the front or all wheels.Making 148 horsepower at 6,000 and 142 foot-pounds of torque at a lofty 4,000 rpm, a front-wheel-drive RAV4 with a stick shift should accelerate from zero to 60 mph in about 10.5 seconds. Adding weight, in the form of 4WD, passengers, cargo or an automatic transmission, will slow the already sluggish RAV in the stoplight drag race. Toyota needs to offer more power. Despite the inclusion of variable valve timing with intelligence (VVT-i), the new, larger, and heavier RAV4 has difficulty getting to speed. But, on a positive note, the RAV4 is certified a low emission vehicle.Exterior styling takes cues from the existing RAV4, and melds them with a dash of Lexus RX 300 here and Infiniti QX4 there, which is entirely a good thing. Inside, overtones of Celica can be seen in the gauge cluster, steering wheel, and metallic trim pieces. Overall, the RAV has been nicely tidied up, while still adhering to the tenets of the cute ute philosophy.Standard equipment is sparse, with most of the good stuff like antilock brakes, aluminum wheels, air conditioning, remote keyless entry and a power sunroof optional. An option package bundles power windows, doors and locks with A/C, cruise control and a six-speaker sound system with both cassette and CD players. Upgrade to the ""L"" package and you get these goodies plus heated exterior mirrors, floor mats, dark tinted glass, fog lights, and special exterior trim. The ""L"" package is also your ticket to leather upholstery. A limited-slip differential is a stand-alone option on 4WD versions.New whiplash-preventing seats, combined with added passenger room, make the RAV more comfortable. Cargo area has also grown, to a maximum of 68.3 cubic feet with the rear bench seat removed (space measures 29.2 cubic feet with the back seat in use).Five new colors are available: Titanium, Impulse Red, Vintage Gold, Rainforest Mica, and Spectra Blue Mica.

It is  based on Audi's flagship Q8 and sits above the high-performance SQ8 SUV. You  can tell them apart by the RS Q8's more aggressive styling, including a black  front grille, oversized mesh air inlets and bright red brake calipers. It puts  forth a fierce sporty look while not straying too far from its subdued  corporate styling roots. 
The  Audi RS Q8 boasts a turbocharged V8 engine that pumps out 591 horsepower,  considerably more than the SQ8's 500 . Audi says it will go from 0 to 60 mph  in an impressive 3.7 seconds. It is considered a mild hybrid due to its 48-volt  electrical system, which makes stops and starts smoother and slightly improves  fuel economy. As fast as the RS Q8 is, it's the way the big Audi tackles a  twisty road that is even more impressive. Thanks to all-wheel steering, the RS  Q8 feels far more nimble than its size, and weight, would suggest, and it's an  absolute hoot on a good stretch of tarmac.
Inside,  the RS Q8 offers the same tech features and luxurious appointments available on  the standard Q8 SUV, but with extra touches to signify its performance  potential. There's an impressive array of standard equipment, and even though  the RS Q8 sports a more cutdown profile than the more traditionally SUV-shaped  Q8, there's a reasonable amount of passenger and cargo space inside.
Super  SUVs aren't quite as rare as you might think, with similar offerings such as  the BMW X6 M, Porsche Cayenne Turbo Coupe and Mercedes-AMG GLE 63 S Coupe  offering similar performance for similar money. If you want to go a bit further  afield, Range Rover offers a stout version of its very traditional luxury  off-roader, and if you want to go even faster, we'd be remiss if we didn't  mention the Tesla Model X Plaid. Since  there's only one trim level for the RS Q8, your upgrade options are limited to  a few trim packages and a few stand-alone options.

If you order an automatic transmission, a gauge that measures transmission oil temperature replaces the battery gauge, and you can opt to add adjustable pedals to your Super Duty XLT or Lariat truck. Trucks with the Power Stroke diesel get an air filter service indicator. All F-350s get roof ride handles standard for 2002, and the available telescoping trailer mirrors can now be folded forward. SuperCabs have new rear door panel map pockets with molded-in cupholders. XL gets upgraded visors, while XLT and Lariat get new seats with increased width, bolstering and lumbar support; jewellike headlamp lenses and an available Advanced Security Group that includes remote keyless entry, automatic door locks and automatic headlamps. Optional on the XLT Crew Cab and standard on the Lariat Crew Cab is a power front passenger seat. The Lariat also gets a larger standard overhead console with improved storage. When it comes to heavy-duty pick 'em ups, you can choose between a Chevy, a Dodge, a Ford or a GMC. Match your needs to the truck with the most capability to meet them, and you're all set. Of course, which model you select is also guided by brand loyalty. If you're a Ford kind of guy or gal with big loads to haul or tow, the F-350 Super Duty pickup will handle up to 11,500-pounds GVWR or a 12,500-pound conventional trailer. Commercial use is one of the fastest-growing segments in the expanding truck market. With its F-Series Super Duty trucks, Ford is aiming squarely at fulfilling this segment's demand.The Super Duty trucks are built on a separate platform from the smaller F-150. Bigger, stronger and more robust, they are meant to perform feats of which the F-150 isn't capable. The maximum GVWR for the F-150 is 7,700 pounds, the F-250 Super Duty can handle 8,800 pounds, whereas the F-350 Super Duty starts at 9,900 pounds and ranges up to 11,500 pounds. The main mission here is towing and hauling. To provide the necessary grunt, Ford offers three different engines. The gasoline engines are a Triton 5.4-liter V8 and a 6.8-liter V10. The V8 generates 255 horsepower at 4,500 and 350 pound-feet of torque at 2,500 rpm. The V10 generates 310 horsepower at 4,250 and 425 lb-ft of torque at 3,250 rpm. A 7.3-liter turbodiesel V8 is also available, and it makes 250 horsepower at 2,600 and a dominating 505 lb-ft of torque at 1,600 rpm. All of these engines can be equipped with an optional automatic transmission. The F-350 can tow up to 12,500 pounds of conventional trailer when properly equipped and can even wrestle a 14,400-pound fifth-wheel trailer.To match your needs better, the Super Duty comes in Regular Cab, SuperCab and Crew Cab styles. The overall look is much more aggressive than the standard F-150, and its bigger dimensions allow Ford to use larger cabs without compromising load space. SuperCab models have small rear-opening doors, while the Super Duty Crew Cab has four full-size swing-out doors. A variety of optional equipment is available, including electronic shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive, a heavy-duty suspension package and telescoping trailer-towing mirrors.Inside, the roomy cabs have large, comfortable seats and generous seat-track travel. Five or six adults can ride inside with little problem as long as you choose the SuperCab or Crew Cab body. In addition, there are many interior convenience features designed for today's business owners. For example, a fold-down armrest and utility bin are designed to house a portable fax machine or laptop computer. For owners who don't want to skimp on luxury, leather seating is available on Lariat models.Given their size, the F-350 Super Duty trucks maintain a confident on- and off-road feel. They feature modern power steering systems and suspension components to improve vehicle ride, handling, responsiveness and maneuverability. Just don't mistake them for cars. The Super Duty is a true truck and rides harshly when not towing or hauling loads. Parking a Super Duty ranges from tedious (a mall parking lot) to impossible (some home garages and underground parking lots).The Super Duty isn't for everyone. Pricing on a diesel-equipped Crew Cab can approach $40,000.

The Passat has never sold well in the United States.  Weak original engine choices, ineffective early marketing efforts, and a muddled brand identity that defeated sales across the board have all contributed to this car's seemingly invisible presence in the market.  Of course, its plain-vanilla styling didn't let the Passat stand out for much recognition other than the lack of a grille on the nose.Volkswagen managed to increase brand awareness and sales lately, and the Passat has received a good bit of attention during the past few years.  The 2.8-liter V6 that has literally transformed Volkswagen's lineup from staid German sedans to road cars brimming with vitality was transplanted into the Passat four years ago.  A couple years later, a revised exterior design gave this Volkswagen more character, and included a grille for the first time.  Passats came fully loaded in one trim level for 1995; the only options were an automatic transmission, a sunroof and a CD player.  Antilock brakes and traction control were standard equipment.  With a singular GLX trim level, fresh styling, and renewed performance ability, Volkswagen focused the Passat's mission, and became the focus of people who appreciate quick, well-equipped German cars.  Priced in the low 20's, and equipped with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty, the Passat GLX was a real bargain.Marketers fiddled with the Passat recipe again last year, and we feared that the focus placed on the excellent GLX would become blurred with the arrival of newcomers.  The bare-bones entry-level Passat GLS debuted with the meager 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine from the Golf.  At $18,000, the GLS was no match for the Ford Contour SE, which offers the same tight European driving manners and a whole lot more speed for the same price.  Even Volkswagen's own Jetta GLS made better sense. Later in 1996, a TDI (Turbo Direct Injection) diesel model arrived.  Volkswagen said it was one quick, clean and quiet diesel.  Still, the hit-and-miss availability of diesel fuel and relatively low prices for gasoline in the United States made us wonder why VW thinks North America needs a diesel Passat.Evidently, the GLS idea didn't fly.  It's gone for 1997.  The TDI is still scarce, thanks to quality problems, and may not survive much longer in the U.S. market.  This means buyers really have just one readily available choice when buying a Passat.Fine and dandy, Jack.  The GLX is still the one and only Passat to consider, in our opinion.  It continues to offer an excellent blend of value, performance and exclusivity, in either sedan or wagon format.  So what do you think a fully-loaded German sport sedan (or wagon) might cost?  The base price of a new Passat GLX is roughly equivalent to the price of a well-equipped Taurus GL.  Surprise, surprise.  We think you ought to try the Passat GLX whether or not performance is important to you.  It's a good car at a fair price, with the ability to put a grin on your face every time you drive it.",V6 cylinder ,252," 173 lb-ft @ 4,200 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

What a pleasant surprise from Hyundai.  If the latest Sonata hinted at the direction the company was to take in the future, then the Accent is an in-your-face declaration from this Korean manufacturer that the days of selling shoddy, inept vehicles in the United States are over.  The Accent is one of the better subcompacts in today's market.However, you've got to pay for excellence, and the Accent is among the most expensive of its peers.  Only the Toyota Tercel and Dodge/Plymouth Neon twins have higher sticker prices for comparably equipped vehicles.In contrast, a Geo Metro sedan is a tad less pricey than the Accent.  There is a reason for this; the Metro doesn't come standard with such niceties as rear window defogger, cargo area lighting, remote releases for the fuel door and trunk, or digital clock.  Additionally, the Accent benefits from single-piece side stampings, which contribute to stiffer body rigidity, and a 92-horsepower engine that far outranks the top-line 70-horse motor provided in the Geo.  Is the Hyundai worth the additional money over the Metro?  Absolutely!  The Metro feels a bit roomier, but the Accent offers more equipment and feels more solidly constructed than the tinny Geo.Unfortunately for Hyundai, another South Korean automaker has entered the U.S. market, expanding rapidly during the past couple of years.  Kia builds the Sephia sedan, and it is larger and more powerful than the Hyundai.  The Sephia can be loaded to the gills for little more than the Accent, and looks more expensive than it really is in top-level trim.  Sephia is also powered by a proven Mazda powerplant.Aside from the putrid seat fabrics, childish paint schemes and funky smell associated with all new Hyundais, we like the Accent quite a bit.  It's a great set of budget wheels, without the budget engineering or the budget equipment levels.  Still, we recommend the Kia to those who live in parts of the country where the Sephia is currently sold.",Inline 4 cylinder ,240," 97 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Audi,audi a4,2002,audi a4 2002,"['Available all-wheel drive, powerful engines, sharp handling.']",['Prices shoot up with options.'],4.7,"Audi's entry-level sedan and wagon are all new for 2002. Along with a redesigned body structure and new sheet metal, the new A4 receives a variety of changes to make it sportier. It is motivated by either a 170-horsepower 1.8-liter turbocharged four or a completely new 3.0-liter 220-horsepower V6, which can be mated to a six-speed manual transmission. Making its debut this year for non-quattro models is a continuously variable transmission (CVT), also known as multitronic. An in-dash six-disc CD changer and a dual-zone auto climate control top the standard features list. Sportier and roomier, the new A4 is one of most appealing entry-level luxury cars for 2002. When the Audi A4 debuted in the United States in 1995, it set forth the revitalization of the Audi brand. We've been impressed with the A4 since that time and have enjoyed driving the sedan, Avant wagon and the high-performance S4 and S4 Avant. But seven years is a long time for a car in the entry-level luxury car market, so Audi has completely redesigned the A4 sedan and wagon for 2002.The new A4 is more sharply styled than before, with clear glass headlights, dual exhaust and a high waistline being this car's key identifiers. One of our complaints about the previous car, namely the stingy rear accommodations, has been addressed with a wheelbase lengthened by 1.3 inches and an overall increase of 2.7 inches. This results in increased legroom for both front and rear passengers, along with extra space for heads and shoulders.We also felt that the previous A4 wasn't as dynamic as its Teutonic competitor, the BMW 3 Series. Audi responds with a 45 percent improvement in torsional rigidity with a completely new rear multilink suspension that replaces the outdated rear torsion beam; driving fun is further improved with quicker steering response. A Sport package that includes a sport-tuned suspension and grippier wheels and tires is also available.As before, there are two different engines available, as well as front-wheel drive or quattro all-wheel drive for sedans; wagons are only available with AWD. The 170-horsepower 1.8-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine carries over, though it now produces fewer emissions and earns ULEV certification. There's also a new ULEV-certified 3.0-liter 220-horsepower V6. Both engines are exceptionally smooth and have a broad range of usable torque. A five-speed manual is available with the 1.8T, and a six-speed gearbox is standard with the V6.For those who prefer an automatic, models equipped with quattro are available with a five-speed Tiptronic transmission. For front-wheel-drive models, Audi has introduced a continuously variable automatic transmission known as Multitronic. Audi says the Multitronic transmission offers the speed and smoothness of a manual and the convenience of an automatic.Besides the security that quattro provides in foul weather, the A4 comes with plenty of safety equipment, including antilock brakes, brake assist, stability control and front, side and head-protecting side-curtain airbags.Those interested in standard comfort features will find that Audi has sweetened the pot in this department, as well. The A4 comes equipped with an in-dash six-disc CD changer and dual-zone automatic climate control system with a sun sensor and an active charcoal filter. As far as optional goodies are concerned, Audi recently announced that it plans to partner with OnStar to bring telematics services to its customers later this year; the first beneficiary of this union will be the new A4. Other extras include leather upholstery, the Parktronic parking assistance system and a navigation system.With prices starting in the mid-20s, consumers can get a status car that's comfortable and costs less than it does to send your kid to college. Pricing can escalate when heavily equipped, but the new A4 is one of the best entry-luxury cars on the market. And if a sedan or wagon seems a bit too sensible for you, just wait a few months -- Audi will release the 2003 A4 Cabriolet, a four-seat convertible, in the fall of 2002.",Inline 4 cylinder ,210," 166 lb-ft @ 1,950 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

A new luxury package for the XL includes power leather-trimmed seats, 15-inch alloy wheels, remote keyless entry and a JBL audio system. There's also a Sport Luxury package that adds 16-inch alloy wheels and a rear spoiler in addition to the items in the luxury package. A comfortable, though pasteurized, full-size sedan. It would seem buyers of full-size sedans generally aren't interested in character. Most big four-doors are dull pieces of machinery to look at and a snooze to drive. The beauty in such a vehicle lies in what it can do for the customer in terms of providing space for people and things without compromising the ride or occupant comfort. It should look upscale, but not gaudy, providing just enough glitz and luxury to let others know you have achieved a degree of success in life. Finally, such a vehicle must also be reliable and able to handle years of daily-driver tasks without so much as a whimper. Since its introduction in 1995, the Toyota Avalon has fit this description: bland as egg whites, but solid, roomy and dependable. There are two models from which to choose: XL and XLS. The main difference between the two is the level of standard equipment, with XLS representing the more luxurious version with JBL audio, programmable HomeLink remote system, remote keyless entry and aluminum wheels.Either can be ordered with front bucket or bench seats trimmed in available leather upholstery. Other options include a premium audio system with a six-disc in-dash CD changer, memory seating positions for front passengers, a sunroof and a 115-volt A/C outlet capable of powering small electronic devices.For its own power, the Avalon relies on a three-liter V6 engine. Equipped with variable valve timing, this V6 offers good fuel economy and power. It produces 210 horsepower and 220 pound-feet of torque, which is transmitted to the front wheels through a four-speed automatic.These horses are more than enough for city driving and highway passing, and owners can expect 0-to-60 acceleration times to take about 8 seconds. Once moving, the Avalon's light steering and soft suspension make for comfortable long-distance cruising.Toyota's full-size car is also great for transporting people and luggage. Road and wind noise is minimal thanks to thick side glass and substantial sound-deadening materials. While billed as a six-passenger car with the front bench, the middle front occupant doesn't have much legroom. We recommend getting an Avalon with the comfortable and supportive bucket seats unless there is genuine need for six-passenger seating. The trunk holds 15.9 cubic feet of cargo, and there is a locking pass-through door behind the rear seat. This pass-through allows room for longer items such as skis.Another one of Avalon's strengths lies in safety. The car has earned a crash-test rating of ""Good"" from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and better-than-average scores from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Toyota's Vehicle Skid Control, or VSC, can be added to the Avalon XLS. This system includes traction and stability control systems that can reduce the chance of hazardous skids and slides. The Avalon also features a brake-assist system that detects emergency braking and applies supplemental pressure to reduce stopping distances.With the Avalon, Toyota meets and exceeds the full-size sedan-buyer's expectations. Sure, the price is higher than offerings from Detroit like the Buick LeSabre and Mercury Grand Marquis. But unflappable quality doesn't come cheap.

Do you need a crossover that can handle whatever life throws at it? The Subaru Forester delivers with standard all-wheel drive, a roomy interior and plenty of ground clearance for off-road excursions. You can even add a turbocharged engine, or stick with the base engine for better fuel economy. Let's take a look at the Forester's full range of talents. The small crossover SUV category is intensely competitive,  and it's one in which the 2016 Subaru Forester holds its own quite well. Along  with the sure-footedness of standard all-wheel drive, the Forester delivers  plenty of cargo capacity, roomy seating and an available turbocharged engine  that's one of the strongest in its class. There's nothing super flashy about this  crossover, but Subaru is a believer in  offering functional simplicity. That's precisely what you get with the 2016  Forester.

The 2016 Subaru  Forester is as comfortable in the desert as it is on the highway, thanks to  standard all-wheel drive and generous ground clearance.
Safety and fuel economy are key attributes for the small  crossover class, and the Forester delivers here, too. Though blind-spot  monitoring is curiously missing from the Forester's features list, it does  offer an available forward collision mitigation system plus perfect crash-test  scores. As for fuel efficiency, the Forester's continuously variable  transmission (CVT) is a big help, especially when cruising on the highway. But even  models with the six-speed manual -- a rare treat in this class -- can hold  their heads high when it's time to fill up.
If there's one real drawback to the 2016 Subaru Forester, it's  that it doesn't do a whole lot beyond the rational to woo you. Shoppers seeking  classier interiors or more engaging on-road manners may find the 2016 Ford Escape and 2016 Mazda CX-5 more to  their liking, while the 2016  Hyundai Tucson provides more visual panache. For outdoor recreation  enthusiasts, the off-road-tuned Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk is  worth a hard look. Then there are the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4, which remain tough  to beat for all-around competence. Comparison shopping is definitely a must in  the small crossover SUV category, but overall we're confident that the 2016 Subaru  Forester deserves a spot on your list. All 2016 Subaru Foresters come standard with all-wheel  drive. The 2.5i Limited, 2.5i Touring and all 2.0XT models have an additional  driver-selectable mode that optimizes various functions to improve traction on  slippery surfaces. These models also include hill descent control.
The 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i features a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine that produces 170 horsepower and 174 pound-feet of torque.  A six-speed manual transmission is standard for the 2.5i and 2.5i Premium  trims, with a CVT optional. The higher trims are CVT-only.
The EPA rates CVT-equipped 2.5i models at 27 mpg combined (24 city/32 highway), a laudable achievement for an all-wheel-drive crossover.  If you get the manual transmission, the numbers drop to 25 combined (22  city/29 highway). In Edmunds testing, a CVT-equipped Forester 2.5i Limited  accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 9.0 seconds, which is about average for a  base-engine AWD crossover in this segment.
Stronger performance is available if you choose the 2.0XT.  Its standard turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder churns out 250  and 258  lb-ft of torque and comes only with the CVT. In Edmunds testing, a Forester  2.0XT Touring accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 6.3 seconds, which is  exceptionally quick for a crossover in this class with an upgraded engine. The  2.0XT could also impress on the fuel economy front; the EPA estimates 25 mpg combined (23 city/28 highway), though our test vehicle struggled to match these numbers  in real-world driving. The other downside is that the 2.0XT can tow just 1,500  pounds -- same as the base Forester. Antilock disc brakes, traction and stability control, front  side airbags, side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag and a rearview camera  are standard on all 2016 Subaru Foresters. The Starlink Safety Plus telematics  system, which is standard for most Foresters, includes emergency assistance and  automatic collision notification. It can be further upgraded to the Starlink  Safety Plus and Security Plus system that adds remote services (door unlocking,  vehicle location services, stolen vehicle recovery and alarm notification). Lane  departure warning, forward collision warning and a forward collision mitigation  system with automatic braking are available via the EyeSight driver-assist technology  package. 
In Edmunds brake testing, a Forester 2.0XT stopped from 60  mph in 119 feet, a good number for this class. A Forester 2.5i (with the  17-inch wheels) made this same stop in 126 feet, which is a little worse than  average.
In government crash tests, the Subaru Forester earned a top five-star  rating for overall protection in crash tests, with four stars for total  frontal-impact safety and five stars for total side-impact safety. The  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave the Forester its top score of ""Good""  in the moderate overlap frontal-offset, small-overlap frontal-offset,  side-impact and head restraint/seat (whiplash protection) tests. The IIHS also  gave the Forester's optional automatic emergency braking system a top score of ""Superior."" The 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i won't set any speed records  with its 170 horses, and while the CVT performs well for the breed, it lacks  the responsiveness of a good conventional automatic. Still, the base engine's impressive  fuel economy should be enough compensation for most buyers, and it's also the  only way to go if you want the manual transmission. As for the 2.0XT's  turbocharged engine, it's a strong performer, and ideal if you drive a lot on  hilly or high-altitude terrain.
Around town and on the highway, the Forester serves up a  comfortable and quiet ride. It's really just on curvy roads that its tall  height and compliant suspension become liabilities, as it's simply not as  capable or nimble as many rivals. You do get an extra dollop of off-road  capability with the Forester, though, thanks to generous ground clearance and an  available driver-selectable ""X Mode"" that maximizes traction in the  dirt. The various textures and accents used throughout the 2016  Subaru Forester's interior deliver enough visual appeal to keep pace with other  affordable crossovers, though the overall look follows Subaru's simplicity-is-better  design philosophy. We are happy to see Subaru add its latest technology  interface (Starlink) to the Forester. Even the base 2.5i comes with a  touchscreen with smartphone app integration (including Aha, Pandora,  iHeartradio and Sticher), while the larger 7-inch screen gets upgraded graphics  and allows you to use intuitive pinch-and-expand finger movements to zoom in or  out.

The Forester offers a useful  amount of cargo area with the rear seatbacks up, and is a class leader when  they are folded flat.
Where the Forester really shines is in its functionality.  Elevated stadium-type rear seating enhances thigh support and legroom and  affords a better view. This sense of space is reinforced by a huge cargo hold  that yields 34.4 cubic feet behind the rear seats and 74.7 cubic feet with the  rear seatbacks folded. The latter is nearly 4 more cubic feet than the Honda  CR-V, which has traditionally been at the head of this class. The caveat is  that you'll need to stick to the base model if you want the big numbers, as  models with the panoramic sunroof drop to 31.5/68.5 cubic feet due to a lower  roof height. 
Standard equipment on the 2.5i includes 17-inch steel  wheels, full power accessories, cruise control, a height-adjustable driver  seat, 60/40-split folding rear seatbacks, a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, a rearview camera, a 6.2-inch  touchscreen with Subaru's Starlink technology interface,  smartphone app integration and a four-speaker sound system with HD radio, a CD  player, an auxiliary audio jack and a USB port.

The 2016 Forester is  available in six different trim levels, with the Limited and Touring being the  most-equipped choices.
Optional for the base 2.5i (with the CVT) are 17-inch wheels  and roof rails. These items come standard on the 2.5i Premium, which further  adds rear privacy glass, a panoramic sunroof, an eight-way power driver seat (with  two-way power lumbar), a rear armrest with cupholders, reclining rear seatbacks,  a larger 7-inch touchscreen, voice commands, Starlink Safety Plus (see Safety  section below) and a six-speaker sound system with satellite radio and dual USB  ports. An All-Weather package (heated side mirrors and heated front seats) is  standard if the manual transmission is specified, but it's an extra-cost option  with the CVT.
The 2.5i Limited comes with the All-Weather package as standard  and adds automatic headlights, foglights, an adjustable-height power liftgate,  a rear roof spoiler, automatic climate control, an upgraded instrument cluster,  leather upholstery, a cargo area tray and a standard CVT with hill descent  control.
The 2.5i Touring throws in 18-inch alloy wheels, xenon headlights,  keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone automatic climate control, an  eight-speaker Harman  Kardon sound system and one-touch folding rear seatbacks.
Moving to the 2.0XT Premium brings all the equipment of the  2.5i Premium plus the 2.0-liter turbocharged engine and CVT, 18-inch alloy  wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, the All-Weather package, a rear roof spoiler,  the upgraded instrument cluster and a leather-wrapped steering wheel.
The 2.0XT Touring offers the same upgrades as the 2.5i  Touring.
Auto-dimming mirrors are optional for all Foresters. Optional  on the Premium (except with the manual transmission), Limited and Touring trims  is a navigation system and an EyeSight driver  assist technology package (see Safety, below) that includes adaptive cruise  control.",Flat 4 cylinder ,250," 174 lb-ft @ 4,100 ",all wheel drive , 6-speed manual

For 2023, the A5 range gets a new set of standard 18-inch alloy  wheels in a five-spoke design along with standard Matrix LED headlights.  Packages and options also see minor changes. Like other Audis, the A5 boasts a  high-quality, tech-rich interior that looks impressive without being  ostentatious. One of the cabin's highlights is a 10.1-inch central touchscreen  featuring clear graphics and a responsive display.  For propulsion, the A5 comes equipped with one of two  turbocharged four-cylinder engines: a base 2.0-liter that makes 201 horsepower  and an upgraded 2.0-liter that puts out 261 horsepower. If you need more  performance you can step up to the S5 or RS 5 (reviewed separately).  The A5 is comfortable, handles confidently, and has no shortage  of well-executed tech features. But it could use a bit more storage space and a  more exciting driving experience to keep up with the competition, particularly  the BMW 4 Series, which is offered in coupe, convertible and four-door hatch  form just like the A5.

Get ready for another crossover SUV in  Ford's lineup. Eyeing the burgeoning success of subcompacts such as the  Chevrolet Trax and the Honda HR-V, Ford has dipped into its global cache to  bring you the 2018 EcoSport. 
Already on sale in other countries, the  EcoSport is indeed a small utility vehicle — it's nearly a  foot-and-a-half shorter than the Escape. Inside, you'll notice the difference  in cargo capacity. The Escape boasts 34 cubic feet of space behind the rear  seats, while the EcoSport makes do with just 20.9 cubic feet (about 2 cubes  fewer than a Focus hatchback). Among pint-size crossovers, though, the  EcoSport's cargo area is actually one of the largest in its class.
Ford has you covered if you're looking  for the latest entertainment technology. Almost all EcoSport trim levels are  equipped with a large central touchscreen powered by the excellent Sync 3  infotainment system featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration.  Unfortunately, there's not as much a priority on advanced safety equipment  — a standard rearview camera and optional blind-spot monitor are the  only modern-day driver aids you'll find.
Another downside is the EcoSport's  available engines. A turbocharged three-cylinder with front-wheel drive is  standard, while a slightly more powerful four-cylinder is paired with all-wheel  drive. The three-cylinder engine is painfully slow; a 0-60 mph time of 11.4  seconds is worst-in-class. It'll be even worse with passengers in tow. The  four-cylinder offers slightly better acceleration, but its 4 mpg hit to fuel  economy in city driving is substantial. Frankly, it's a no-win proposition with  either engine. 
Overall, the Ford EcoSport is a viable  subcompact SUV as long as you keep in mind the lethargic acceleration and lack  of the latest and greatest safety features. The all-new 2018 Ford EcoSport is an intriguing new entry into the subcompact crossover SUV market. Its low price and baby-Escape looks will win some fans, but we're not sure the standard engine is up to the task of carrying friends and cargo. Each vehicle typically comes in multiple versions  that are fundamentally similar. The ratings in this review are based on our full test of  the Ford EcoSport Titanium (turbo  1.0-liter inline-3 | 6-speed automatic | FWD), with additional impressions of a Ford EcoSport SES (2.0-liter  inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | AWD). Unless the three-cylinder engine's turbochargers are spooled up and ready for action, it requires a Herculean effort to bring the EcoSport to highway speeds. In Edmunds testing, it required 11.4 seconds to reach 60 mph from a stop, one of the most leisurely paces in this segment. Selecting the 2.0-liter/AWD combo shaves a full second off the 0-60 mph time. There's a delay between the application of the brake pedal and the car slowing in earnest. Firm pressure is required for stopping power, but slowing is smooth and stable. Emergency stops are drama-free with no pulling. Coming to a halt from 60 mph takes 124 feet — just shy of average for the class. The steering feels fairly accurate in direction and offers confidence that the car will go where the wheel commands it. But the steering feel is abysmal. It's as though the steering wheel is connected to the tires with only a large rubber band, which is a strange sensation that's hard to get accustomed to. Despite the EcoSport's top-heavy looks, body roll isn't severe. You can whip the EcoSport into curves with some confidence if you're mindful of the car's front-weight bias. (The rear end likes to wiggle when driven hard.) Grippier tires would reclaim a measure of sport, but this is not a car for spirited driving. It feels frenetic and overcaffeinated in dense urban traffic. The transmission is indecisive about whether it needs to save fuel or deliver quick acceleration, yet it's not particularly good at either. Long intervals between gear changes mean the EcoSport tends to bog down during upshifts. The unobtrusive side bolsters offer easy entry and exit, and they still manage to secure front passengers in fast turns. The seat bottoms are firm and comfy, but the seatbacks feel flat as boards. The rear seats are flat, shapeless and utilitarian. The combination of power seat adjustments and manual lumbar controls is clumsy. The EcoSport delivers a choppy, bumpy ride on most road surfaces. It won't rattle your teeth, but this car lacks the refined damping of a competitor such as the Mazda CX-3. It handles road undulations well, but it gets bounced around by the sharper impacts of bad, rashy pavement. The three-cylinder's small-engine snarl makes its way into the cabin, but it sounds surprisingly good, even when pushed. The cabin does a good job muting most road and tire noise, and at idle you'll barely hear the engine. But while road and wind noise is hushed, large and small impacts still creep into the cabin. The controls and adjustments are straightforward. The A/C has no trouble cooling the cabin quickly on a warm day. The auto setting offers high, medium and low fan speeds, nice for minimizing noise when trying to cool or heat the cabin. The seat heaters begin roasting within a minute and are warm and toasty even on the lowest setting. Most common controls are simple to read and within easy reach, but the steering wheel and stalk buttons are a bit cryptic. The touchscreen, basically a tablet affixed to the dash, is tricky. Its vertical orientation requires a steady finger to enter commands. A separate controller would be preferable. The front seat height is just right, and short thigh bolsters make it easy to slide in and out. But the rear seats are trickier. Since the seat bottoms are placed higher than the front seats for a ""stadium seating"" effect — which is nice for rear passengers to see out of the windshield — a noticeable step up is required. A decent range of power seat adjustments makes it easy to find a comfortable perch, whether you prefer traditional SUV ""command""-style or lower ""cockpit""-style angle. A thigh-angle adjustment would be nice especially for taller drivers on long drives. The driver and front passenger get good headroom and legroom, but they'll fight over a tiny armrest surface. Rear seat room is decent, but 6-foot-tall front passengers will make things tight for the passenger behind them. There's a good sense of space between the seats and the door panels. The cabin doesn't feel claustrophobic. Forward visibility is obscured by large windshield pillars, while small sail windows at the pillar bases make futile attempts to reclaim some of that visibility. The thick rear window pillars also create large blind spots. The narrow rear window doesn't help. Blind-spot monitoring is a welcome feature. The EcoSport looks and feels solid overall, but our test car had an annoying and persistent unidentified rattle from the rear of the cabin. There's a very skinny but deep center console up front with a handy tray. The door pockets offer bottle holders and long molded channels for phones, snacks and personal items. The mobile phone cutout/shelf for the front passenger is a nice touch. With 20.9 cubic feet behind the second row and 50 cubes of maximum cargo space, the EcoSport makes a compelling case to drivers who like to move around with outdoor and weekend gear or shopping-trip hauls. It's more space than most rivals offer, although it's well short of what you'd get by sizing up. Lower LATCH anchors aren't very easy to access. The seat backing is pretty stiff, and you'll need to work the buckles to push them past the stiff upholstery and connect with the LATCH hooks. There are three tethers behind the rear seatbacks. Onboard navigation looks sharp and sophisticated and offers a good alternative to iPhone and Android navigation apps. The 8-inch touchscreen is large and high-resolution. Audio quality is good, although there's a certain color baked into the Bang & Olufsen system. Basic EQ functions help dial in the best tone. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are included with Sync 3, which comes standard on SE trims and above. (The base S model offers a basic Sync system.) Other devices can be integrated into the EcoSport's basic Bluetooth or wired Sync system. It offers a rearview camera and blind-spot monitoring — almost a necessity owing to the enormous rear blind spot. But there are no other more advanced features, such as automatic emergency braking or lane departure warning. They're not even optional. Voice controls are limited to phone, navigation and audio commands, but they work well enough within those parameters. Users need to follow a fairly rigid sequence, and clear pronunciation is key. Oddly enough, voice command defaults to Siri when an iPhone is plugged into the USB even when operating outside of CarPlay. The SE is the sweet spot of the EcoSport  lineup, packing a bunch of features into this small crossover. It's more  expensive than the base-level S, but in return you get more features plus  greater access to option packages. If you're thinking of adding the Convenience  package, you might as well step up to the Titanium or SES. It's included on  both trims. Just note that the price of a fully loaded EcoSport is going to be  close to roomier small crossovers, such as Ford's Escape. The EcoSport's  2.0-liter engine is a must if you frequently carry passengers. 
EcoSport  S, SE and Titanium models with front-wheel drive are powered by a turbocharged  1.0-liter three-cylinder engine (123 horsepower, 125 pound-feet of torque).  Optional for those models and standard on the SES is all-wheel drive and a  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (166 hp, 149 lb-ft). Both engines are paired to  a six-speed automatic transmission. 
The  short list of standard equipment on the base S model is indicative of its modest price. Features include 16-inch  alloy wheels, automatic headlights, hill start assist, remote locking and  unlocking, full power accessories, a rearview camera, air conditioning, cruise  control, a driver information display, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel,  height-adjustable front seats, 60/40-split rear seats, a cargo cover, a  removable cargo floor panel, front floor mats, Bluetooth, a 4.2-inch central  display screen, and a six-speaker audio system with two USB ports.
Upgrading  to the SE equips the EcoSport with  LED running lights, foglights, body-colored exterior accents, roof rails, rear  privacy glass, rear parking sensors, a sunroof, keyless entry and ignition,  dual-zone automatic climate control, an upgraded driver information display, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, a six-way power-adjustable  driver seat (with manual lumbar), heated front seats, upgraded cloth  upholstery, rear floor mats, a 6.5-inch touchscreen with the Sync 3 interface,  satellite radio, and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality.  Seventeen-inch wheels are available as a stand-alone option.
The  SE's optional Convenience package  further adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, interior  ambient lighting, a navigation system, an 8-inch touchscreen, a seven-speaker  audio system and a 110-volt household-style power outlet.
The SES is the somewhat sporty variant.  It has the contents of the Convenience package and the 2.0-liter engine/AWD  combo, along with 17-inch wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, black exterior styling  elements, automatic wipers, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, steering  wheel-mounted shift paddles and leather upholstery with cloth inserts.
The  luxe Titanium builds off the  contents of the SE with Convenience package, further adding 17-inch wheels, body-colored  bumpers, heated mirrors, automatic wipers, an auto-dimming rearview mirror,  leather upholstery, blind-spot monitoring, and a 10-speaker Bang & Olufsen  premium audio system with HD radio.
A  Cold Weather package is available on all trims except the S, adding the heated  mirrors, a heated steering wheel, a windshield wiper de-icer and floor mats.

The 2020 Ford F-350 is very  similar to the F-250 in design and driving character. They have the same  powerful engines options and generally the same standard and optional features.  The biggest difference is the F-350's upgraded capability.  
This  year's Super Duty has new engine and transmission combos that now provide more  than 20,000 pounds of conventional trailer towing capacity. Then you have a cab  full of tech comforts, such as voice-controlled infotainment and a Wi-Fi  hotspot, available leather interiors, even cooled front seats and ambient  lighting. One thing's for sure: Today's heavy-duty truck no longer needs to be  limited to the job site.
The  Super Duty also gets a new off-road package called the Tremor, which is a step  up from the existing FX4 package. The Tremor package upgrades start with a  2-inch front lift and shorter airdam, followed by 35-inch Goodyear Wrangler  DuraTrac all-terrain tires. It also includes a retuned suspension, upgraded  shock absorbers, a locking rear differential, a limited-slip front differential,  a rock-crawl mode, and low-speed cruise control. The skid plates from the FX4  package are also included.
In  total, the 2020 F-350 continues the trend of bringing a friendly and accessible  experience to heavy-duty trucks. Certainly, you have options. The Chevrolet  Silverado 3500HD and GMC Sierra 2500HD twins have been redesigned for 2020, and  Ram redid its 3500 just last year. But even though the Ford F-350 Super Duty  isn't the freshest choice, it remains a compelling pick if you want a truck that  can do just about anything. The  cost of an F-350 can easily get out of control. That's why we like the XLT, which adds many helpful safety  features for a reasonable price.

Each  of these trucks has bragging rights in one way or another, and they're all  competitive when it comes to maximum capabilities.  
Depending  on the configuration and drivetrain, the Chevy Silverado 3500HD can tow 36,000  pounds with a fifth-wheel/gooseneck-style trailer and can carry up to 7,442  pounds of payload. These numbers fall a little short relative to its rivals,  but the Silverado 3500HD's high-strength steel Durabed offers more capacity  than the competition at 89 cubic feet for the long cargo bed. The Silverado 3500HD  also excels with regard to value as it has the lowest base price of this  quartet of heavy-haulers.
Chevrolet  redesigned the Silverado 3500HD for the 2020 model year and has made few  changes since. That trend continues for the 2022 Silverado 3500HD. The handy  Multi-Flex tailgate is now available for all trim levels, and Chevy is offering  one new paint color and one new 20-inch wheel design. However, the truck's most  glaring flaw — the cheap interior — remains. It will likely  get a major upgrade next year, similar to the interior enhancements the  Silverado 1500 light-duty model received this year.
Ultimately,  your choice in a new heavy-duty truck comes down to personal preference and  your budget. If you like the Silverado 3500HD, chances are you'll find it  agreeable, even if it isn't at the top of its small competitive class. Though  the Silverado 3500HD is built for work, chances are you'll want it to have more  than just the basics. That's why we recommend the LT trim, which is available with all three cab styles. The  Silverado 3500HD LT has a more upscale interior than the more affordable Work  Truck and serves as your ticket to a wider range of optional features that help  you better configure the truck to personal preferences.",V8 cylinder ,150," 464 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",rear wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

The Accord SE is based on the LX four-cylinder coupe or sedan trim level with an automatic transmission. Features setting the SE apart from LX models include an upgraded audio system, a driver seat power height adjustment, interior wood grain trim, antilock brakes, remote keyless entry and 15-inch alloy wheels. Despite renewed competition this year from Toyota and Nissan, the 2002 Honda Accord is still one of the best midsize sedans sold in America. The benchmark. The best-selling car in America. The highest resale value in its class. These are all statements that have been made with regularity concerning the Honda Accord, a vehicle that is always on the short list of the most popular cars in this country. The Accord won a loyal base of customers by offering notable performance, room for four, frugal fuel economy and a virtual guarantee that, if cared for properly, it would never break.This sixth-generation Accord is available in coupe and sedan body styles, equipped with basic DX (sedan only), mid-grade LX or loaded EX trim. There are also two new trim levels this year: SE and Value Package (VP). The standard 2.3-liter four-cylinder engine in the DX Sedan is worth 135 horses. LX and EX models come with a VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) engine, in your choice of 2.3-liter four-cylinder (which generates 150 horsepower) or 3.0-liter V6 (200 horsepower) configurations.The spunky fours can be mated to a slick-shifting manual or four-speed automatic transmission driving the front wheels. The V6, available only with the automatic, is a model of refinement, revving smoothly and silently.Now that we've praised the living daylights out of this car, here's some bad news: The low price of the DX is accompanied by a low level of equipment. Also, the Accord is easy to drive, but it doesn't reward the driver much for the efforts. You won't mistake this for a performance car -- look to the Nissan Altima for competent canyon-carving. The Accord is suited more to daily driving in the urban jungle, featuring decent acceleration, strong brakes and light, effortless steering.As with the Toyota Camry (which is all-new this year, incidentally), refinement and attention to detail are the Accord's strengths. Almost all interior materials are pleasing to the eye and touch, and are assembled with great care. Body panel gap tolerances are about half what you'd find in competing American products. Storage room abounds; the Accord mimics a minivan with so many places to stash maps, drinks, change and assorted detritus. Spacious, comfortable and quiet, the Accord will tote many happy campers for miles on end as long as they don't mind the rather stiff highway ride. The seats are comfortable, both front and rear, and ergonomics are nearly flawless. While not exactly spicy, the Honda Accord is the definitive family sedan or personal coupe. A low price, a high level of refinement, a cavernous interior and a well-deserved reputation for reliability put the Accord at the top of the heap. Even a loaded EX V6 model with leather, alloy wheels, power moonroof, automatic climate control, CD player, premium sound and steering-wheel radio controls barely surpasses the $25,000 mark. Accord remains the benchmark by which all other midsize cars are measured.",Inline 4 cylinder ,245," 145 lb-ft @ 4,700 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Optional Tiptronic automanual transmission.'],['Small back seat.  Useless cupholders.'],4.2,"The 2.8 sedan gets a valve job resulting in 18 more horsepower and additional torque. Side-impact airbags are standard, as is traction control. Opt for the automatic and you'll get the same Tiptronic technology that allows Biff to manually shift Buffy's 911 Cabriolet. A new station wagon called Avant debuts, while the A4 1.8T gets new wheels, a sport package and an ambient temperature gauge. New colors and stereo improvements round out the changes for 1998. Buy this car. Audi's A4 is sleek, sophisticated and speedy, and has won praise worldwide from the automotive media. Small but safe, the A4 scored best in its class in the 35-mph offset crash tests performed in Europe, and performed brilliantly in stateside crash testing. For U.S. buyers, this translates into a competent and crashworthy alternative to the BMW 3-Series, Acura TL-Series and Volvo 850, among others.For 1998, three versions will be available: the 1.8T, the 2.8 and the 2.8 Avant. A 2.8-liter V6 engine putting 190 horsepower through the front wheels powers the 2.8 models. The less expensive 1.8T, which features a turbocharged 20-valve inline four-cylinder engine good for 150 horsepower, is available in the same configurations as the 2.8; front- or all-wheel drive with a five-speed manual transmission or an automatic.The A4 features a multi-link front suspension that virtually eliminates torque steer, according to Audi. We've tried a front driver and their claims have been substantiated. Quattro all-wheel drive continues as a stand-alone option, reasonably priced at $1,650. Dual front airbags, side-impact airbags mounted in the front seats and antilock brakes come standard. Purchase an A4 and enjoy free maintenance for three years and 50,000 miles. Audi's 1.8T model features alloy wheels, a unique Sport package and a base price starting in the low 20s. Standard equipment on the more expensive 2.8 includes a more powerful V6 engine, wood trim and fog lights. The 2.8's eight-way power driver's seat with lumbar support is exceptionally comfortable. Leather upholstery is available only on the 2.8. A theft alarm keeps thieves from making off with the radio or anything else left in an unattended car. All-new for 1998 is the 2.8 Avant, a sportswagon version of the A4 that should compete well with loaded Subaru Legacy Outback models when equipped with quattro all-wheel drive. A short options list reveals that almost everything you need comes standard on the A4. With prices starting near $24,000, this means that you can get a status car that is comfortable, well-equipped and costs less than it does to send your kid to college. We think that Audi has a winner with the A4: the affordable 1.8T, much-improved 2.8, and new 2.8 Avant will do nothing but enhance Audi's image with near-luxury buyers.",V6 cylinder ,142," 207 lb-ft @ 3,200 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed automatic

Among small luxury crossover SUVs, the  2018 Buick Envision might be worth your attention. Though its exterior styling  is generic, it comes with a generous amount of features for the price and has  an attractive interior trimmed in high-quality materials. It slots between the  compact Encore and larger Enclave in Buick's portfolio. As such, it's pretty  easy to maneuver around town but still has a decent amount of interior and  cargo space. We recommend stepping up to the  Envision's optional turbocharged 2.0-liter engine since it provides a more  suitable amount of power for a luxury crossover. At that point, the Envision is  priced similarly to crossovers such as the Acura RDX and Volvo XC60 but still  less than what you'll likely pay for an Audi Q5 or BMW X3. In total, there's  nothing about the Envision that makes it truly stand out in this class, but it  nonetheless covers the bases well enough to make it worth a look. Sandwiched between the smaller Encore and three-row Enclave in Buick's lineup, the Envision is an easy-to-drive crossover SUV that delivers a lot of features for the price. It doesn't have a whole lot of personality, but if you're mostly interested in a quiet and comfortable SUV, it's worth a look. Edmunds  has only limited experience with the 2018 Envision. The following is our first  take on what's significant about it and what you can expect. With the turbo 2.0-liter engine, power is adequate. It's enough to merge onto highways without issue. Expect a more belabored experience with the base 2.5-liter engine. The Envision can feel a bit unsettled and ponderous when driven around turns. The seats are well cushioned and supportive for long drives. The suspension ably soaks up bumps in the road, and the active noise canceling system helps to keep the cabin nice and quiet. Interior design and materials are up to entry-level luxury car standards. Forward visibility is excellent, but the thick rear roof pillars will obstruct the rearward view. There's plenty of space in the rear seats for three adults, and the slide/recline function should keep them comfortable. There's an average amount of space behind the rear seats, but folding them down reveals 57.3 cubic feet of total cargo space, which is smaller than average. Interior storage is generous, with plenty of large bins and pockets to hold your personal items. Buick's GM-based infotainment system is easy to use. The inclusion of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto makes operation even easier. We  consider the turbocharged 2.0-liter engine upgrade the best fit for the 2018  Buick Envision. The base 2.5-liter engine struggles a bit by comparison. For  this reason, we recommend the Premium or Premium II trims, which are the  only ones to come with the turbocharged engine. Standard  features for the base Envision trim  include 18-inch wheels, foglights, auto-dimming and heated mirrors, a  hands-free power liftgate with adjustable opening heights, rear parking  sensors, keyless ignition and entry, remote start, dual-zone automatic climate  control, power-adjustable and heated front seats, and 60/40-split folding rear  seats. Standard tech features include OnStar communications (includes 4G LTE  connection and Wi-Fi hotspot), Bluetooth, a rearview camera, an 8-inch  touchscreen, a rearview camera, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration, four USB ports (two are charge-only), Bluetooth, and a six-speaker  sound system with satellite radio.The Preferred trim is essentially the  same but is eligible for more options. The Essence trim adds three-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, a heated  steering wheel, driver-seat memory settings, heated outboard rear seats, and  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert. Stepping  up to the Premium trim gets you  19-inch wheels, front parking sensors, automatic wipers, a larger driver  information display, a seven-speaker Bose premium audio system, a 110-volt  household power outlet, a forward collision alert system, and lane departure  warning and intervention system. At  the top of the range, the Premium II trim adds adaptive xenon headlights, automatic high beams, an automated parking  system, a navigation system, a head-up display, an extendable thigh support for  the driver seat, and ventilated front seats. This trim is eligible for the  Driver Confidence package that includes adaptive cruise control, a top-down  parking camera system, and forward collision mitigation system with automatic  braking.Some  features are available on supporting trims as options.

Variable steering reduces effort at low speeds for easier parking, and automatic transmissions shift more smoothly. Last year, for the first time in 25 years, Chevy dealers received a brand new, completely redesigned, full-size van to sell.  Well, sort of.  The supply of 1996 models was little more than a trickle as the factory suffered through teething problems.  The Chevy Van (the cargo hauler) and the Express (the people hauler) were expected to arrive in dealer showrooms last spring.  For 1997, the bugs have been worked out at the plant, and consumers might actually find one of these new vans on a dealer's lot.  Equipped with dual airbags and four-wheel anti-lock brakes, Chevrolet is looking forward to stealing some of Ford's thunder in the full-size van market.Rugged full-frame construction replaces the unibody setup of the previous-generation Chevy Van.  Preferred by converters, full-frame construction allows for improved stability, ride and handling.  Regular-length models carry 267 cubic feet of cargo, and extended-length vans can haul 317 cubic feet of stuff.  Trick rear doors open 180 degrees to make loading and unloading the new van easier.  Up to 15 passengers can ride in the extended-length Express, which ought to make this new van a hit with shuttle services.  Other seating options include five, eight and twelve passenger arrangements.  G3500's can tow up to 10,000 pounds when properly equipped.For convenience, the full-size spare is stored underneath the cargo floor.  A 31-gallon fuel tank keeps this thirsty vehicle from frequent fill-ups, but topping off an empty tank will quickly empty your wallet.  Engine choices are sourced from the Chevrolet family of Vortec gasoline motors, and, for the first time, a turbocharged diesel can be installed in Chevy's full-size van.  Available are the Vortec 4300 V-6, the 5000, 5700, and 7400 V-8's, and a new 6.5-liter Turbodiesel V-8.  Standard side cargo doors are a 60/40 panel arrangement, but a traditional slider is a no-cost option on 135-inch wheelbase vans.Child safety locks are standard on the rear and side doors of the Express.  Passenger assist handles help passengers into and out of the van.  Front and rear air conditioning is optional.  For 1997, G3500 get dual airbags.  Also new are daytime running lights, smoother shifting automatic transmissions, and electronic variable orifice power steering that reduces effort at low speeds, making these vans easier to park.Exterior styling is an interesting mix of corporate Chevrolet, Astro Van and Lumina Minivan.  The high, pillar-mounted taillights are odd, but functional.  They can easily be seen if the van is operated with the rear doors open.  Low-mounted bumpers and moldings make the Express look taller than it is.  An attractively sculpted body side gives the van's smooth, slab-sided flanks a dose of character.  Three new colors arrive for 1997, in shades of brown, red, and silver.Overall, Chevrolet's thoughtful rendition of the traditional full-size van appears to be right on target, giving Ford's Econoline/Club Wagon the first real competition it has faced in years.",V6 cylinder ,228," 250 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Audi fits the TT with a pleasing number of standard features for the price too.  It's worth checking out if you're shopping for a well-rounded luxury sport  coupe or convertible.

The redesigned 2018 Buick Enclave aims to continue in that  tradition while raising the bar in the style and technology departments.  Equipped  with a more powerful 3.6-liter V6 engine this year (302 horsepower and 260 pound-feet), the Enclave should be notably quicker, especially since this  year's model weighs hundreds of pounds less. The 2018 Enclave is slightly  longer than last year and offers additional legroom for the second-row and  third-row passengers. Maximum cargo space is less than before, but there's  still a generous 97.6 cubic feet with the second and third rows folded down.  We expect the 2018 Enclave will be an  appealing choice for a premium three-row crossover SUV, but we won't know for  sure until we get a chance to test one ourselves.  Buick has fully reesigned its 2018 Enclave. With a powerful V6 engine, more rear passenger space and new technology features, the Enclave should be an appealing choice for a three-row crossover SUV, but we won't know for sure until we get a chance to test one ourselves. Edmunds has not yet driven any version of this vehicle. The following is our first take on what's significant about it and what you can expect. The extra horsepower and reduced weight, along with new transmission, should improve upon the previous generation's somewhat ponderous performance. Active noise canceling reduces extraneous wind, road and powertrain noise. Automatic three-zone climate control is standard, and all trims, aside from the base, benefit from an air ionizer. The available adaptive suspension should further help smooth out the ride. Buick's seven-seat configuration should provide ample room for second-row and third-row passengers. Getting in and out is further helped this year by a tilt-up second-row seat that can provide quick access to the third row, even with a child safety seat installed. With all rear seats folded down, you have a very large load floor. Standard roof rails can handle optional crossbars to load bulky and large items on the roof. Maximum cargo space is less than last year, but it's still healthy at 97.6 cubic feet. Smartphone integration is standard, and advanced driver assist functions are only available in higher trim vehicles. The Essence and Premium can be optioned with a Bose speaker system, and the Avenir can be equipped with stop-and-go adaptive cruise control. To  take advantage of the luxury positioning of this new Enclave, we recommend the Enclave Premium . It includes  low-speed forward collision mitigation, driver seat and mirror position memory,  and an upgraded Bose audio system. Front-wheel drive is standard, but get the  optional all-wheel drive if you live in snow country.  Even  in base form, the Enclave comes with  features that make it competitive in the three-row SUV segment. It comes  standard with 18-inch wheels, LED headlights, rear parking sensors, keyless  entry and ignition, remote engine start, three-zone automatic climate control,  power-adjustable front seats with heating, adjustable second-row captain's  chairs and 60/40-split folding third-row seats. Standard in-car technology includes  an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto integration, OnStar communications (with 4G LTE and  Wi-Fi hotspot), USB ports (two in front and four for rear passengers), and a  six-speaker sound system with satellite radio.  The Essence includes a blind-spot  monitoring system with rear cross-traffic alert, a cabin air ionization system  and leather seating surfaces. Optionally, you can add all-wheel drive, a  heavy-duty tow package that allows you to pull up to 5,000 pounds, a top-down  parking camera system and a sunroof. Premium models add low-speed forward  collision mitigation with pedestrian detection, front parking sensors,  driver-seat memory settings, a Bose 10-speaker premium speaker system, lane  departure warning and intervention, a heated steering wheel, heated seats for  outboard second-row passengers, ventilated seats for the front row, and  power-folding third-row seats.

Optionally, you can  spec your Avenir with an adaptive suspension and an Avenir Technology package  that allows for stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, automatic braking, grille  shutters to increase aerodynamic efficiency, and the aforementioned adaptive  suspension package.

Or perhaps just a vocal handful of them.  But that small club clamoring for a penultimate family hauler from the brand of  four rings gets its wish with the 2021 Audi RS Q8. Debuting  nearly two years ago, shortly after the debut of the slightly less bonkers SQ8,  the RS version (RennSport in Audi circles) leaves little on the table when  judged against its ultra-high-performance rivals from Mercedes, BMW and  Porsche. A turbocharged V8 engine puts out just shy of 600 horsepower, an  adaptive air suspension with anti-body roll feature ensures sticky yet  comfortable handling, and the cabin accommodates five passengers and about 60  cubic feet of maximum cargo space. The RS Q8 also has a top speed of 190 mph.  Because why not?The  monstrous V8 is also pleasingly refined. It comes with a 48-volt mild hybrid  system that helps reduce fuel consumption. A trifling concern maybe, but the  system also aids more seamless engine startup when pulling away from a stop.  And while the RS Q8's coupe-style shape limits it to two rows, the second row  offers seats that slide, recline, and split and fold in a 40/20/40  configuration for maximum versatility and comfort.The  RS Q8 technically arrived as a 2020 model, so it carries into this year  unchanged. And that's fine for now. With prodigious performance and  eye-catching style, the RS Q8 is a formidable entry into a growing group of  riotous grocery-getters. The RS Q8 comes in just one trim, so your only deliberation comes in choosing options. The Driver Assistance package is worth a look since it adds adaptive cruise control. If you want max comfort, get the Luxury package for the massaging front seats and additional leather upholstery.

Speed-sensitive steering reduces effort at low speeds. Remote keyless entry key fobs are redesigned, and automatic transmissions provide better fuel economy and smoother shifts. Believe it or not, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van lineup when the Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996. The GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced in 1971, and sold steadily until recently. Competition and safety regulations forced GM to redo the big vans -- heck, since 1971 Ford had re-engineered the Club Wagon and Econoline twice! To distinguish the new design, GMC rebadged the van Savana. The Savana Cargo features flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard antilock brakes and dual airbags. Front foot and legroom are adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of fore and aft travel. The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet, and storage for items like CDs and cassettes. New for 1997 is speed-sensitive power steering that lowers parking effort at low speeds. G3500 models receive dual front airbags, and daytime running lights make this huge hauler even more conspicuous to other motorists. Automatic transmission refinements result in better fuel economy and smoother shifts.Buyers may select either a 135-inch or a 155-inch wheelbase. Inside the short-wheelbase Savana you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the longer-wheelbase model provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume. Hinged rear doors open 180 degrees for easy loading, and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened up. Gross vehicle weight ratings of up 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase.The base engine is a Vortec 4300 V6 making 200 horsepower. Optional motors include the new GM family of V8's, ranging from the popular Vortec 5000 to the monster Vortec 7400. Also available is a turbodiesel V8 good for 190 horsepower and 385 stump-pulling pound-feet of torque.Like most new product in showrooms these days, the Savana's styling is rounded and bulbous, with a front end that mimics the corporate look carried by most of GM's truck family.

There are some minor feature changes within equipment groups. The interior has also been upgraded with a new steering wheel, switchgear, instrument cluster and materials. The 2008 Chevrolet Express (and its GMC Savana twin) is a capable people carrier for businesses and humongous families.  Full-size vans like the 2008 Chevrolet Express are redesigned so infrequently, a redo date of 1996 is practically fresh. Having been around for more than four decades, Chevrolet's full-size van lived through the 1970s, '80s and half of the '90s via sheet metal changes and updates to the running gear. It assumed today's shape 12 years ago and to celebrate the rebirth, the van's name was changed from ""Sportvan"" to ""Express.""A number of important under-the-skin changes took place for 2003, including a wider selection of V8 engines, the first-time availability of all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements -- all of which went a long way toward making the Express safer and more capable than ever before. For 2008, the interior has been updated again with improved interior materials and switchgear.The 2008 Chevrolet Express still outpaces the even older Ford Econoline and certainly warrants consideration for those who need to ferry a small platoon (up to 15 people can ride in an Express 3500) and require the cargo volume only a large van can provide. Naturally, these attributes are most often needed by small businesses and fleet operators. The European-designed and dramatically more modern Dodge Sprinter is pricier than the Express, but with its much taller interior and better road manners, it makes a much better shuttle. The standard engine on Express 1500 models is a 5.3-liter V8 with 301 horsepower and 325 pound-feet of torque. A 6.0-liter V8 rated at 323  and 373 lb-ft of torque is standard on 3500s. All 1500 models use a four-speed automatic sending power to the rear wheels, while 3500s get a heavy-duty version of that transmission. An all-wheel-drive configuration is also available for the 1500. The maximum trailer-towing capacity on 1500 models is 6,300 pounds, while the heavy-duty 3500 can pull up to 7,600 pounds when properly equipped. All models have four-wheel antilock disc brakes, stability control and side curtain airbags (for the first three rows of seating) as standard. In frontal-impact crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2008 Chevrolet Express scored five stars (the highest possible). A robust frame, rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) and standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes give the 2008 Chevrolet Express respectable ride and handling characteristics. Although Chevy's van is still far from nimble, it's a decent choice for day-to-day driving. And with a pair of strong V8 engines to choose from, merging and passing maneuvers come easily, even when you're hauling a heavy load of passengers and cargo. The Chevy's interior is built for pure functionality, and while it may not be pretty, it gets the job done. All controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver, but the footwells remain as cramped as ever. Express buyers can opt for 60/40-split driver-side doors for easier passenger access to the rear seats. The standard configuration seats 12, with eight- or 15-passenger arrangements also available, depending on which model you choose. The standard-wheelbase (135-inch) Chevrolet Express full-size van comes in half-ton (1500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations. The extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available only on the 3500. There are two trim levels: LS and LT. LS models are geared toward fleet service so standard equipment is limited to features such as air-conditioning, an AM/FM stereo and a theft-deterrent system. The more livable LT models include auxiliary rear air-conditioning and heating, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel and keyless entry. Optional equipment groups are extensive, and include features like power driver and front-passenger seats, alloy wheels and an upgraded audio system with an in-dash six-disc CD changer.",V8 cylinder ,147," 325 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Jeep,jeep grand-wagoneer-l,2023,jeep grand-wagoneer-l 2023,"['Spacious interior', 'Comfortable ride and seats', 'Impressive towing capacity', 'Adult-size third-row seats']",,,"Last  year, Jeep revived a model from its past, the Grand Wagoneer. After a 21-year  absence, the new Wagoneer impressed us with its spacious interior, potent  engine and loads of technology features. But Jeep didn't stop there. 
This  year, the 2023 Jeep Grand Wagoneer L debuts and that ""L"" signifies  that it's a long-wheelbase variant. It's a full foot longer from bumper to  bumper, with 7 of those inches added between the front and rear wheels. That  typically results in more passenger space in the second and third rows, but in  this case, the gains are limited to cargo capacity. The Wagoneer L can hold up  to 42.1 cubic feet of cargo behind the third row, over 50% more than in the  standard Grand Wagoneer.
Passenger  space remains noteworthy, as you can easily accommodate taller adults in any of  its three rows. That's common among other large SUVs in this class. So are high levels of overall comfort. The Grand Wagoneer L gains an advantage over  its rivals with more power and an impressive 10,000-pound tow capacity. We're  not thrilled with the distracting secondary touchscreen mounted low in the dash, though, and the second-row center console protrudes from the cargo floor when  all the seats are folded. If you're planning on hauling large objects, we  suggest opting for the second-row bench instead of the captain's chairs.
Overall,  the 2023 Jeep Grand Wagoneer L is a solid choice when compared to other large  luxury SUVs. These include the Cadillac Escalade and Lincoln Navigator. The  Wagoneer L holds an advantage in regard to power, cargo space and towing  capacity, but we're confident any of these opulent SUVs will easily satisfy.  It's  going to take some time to scroll through the comprehensive list of standard  features for the base Grand Wagoneer L.  That's why it gets our recommendation in the lineup. For the money, the higher  trims don't add many significant features that will make you feel as though  you're missing out on anything.",Inline 6 cylinder ,400," 500 lb-ft @ 3,500 ",four wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic 
Lexus,lexus is-350,,lexus is-350 2014,"['Powerful and refined V6', 'superbly crafted interior with top-quality materials and supportive seats', 'precise steering.']","[""Handling isn't very sharp, even with the F Sport package"", 'mouse-based infotainment interface is distracting to use.']",4.6,"For 2014, the Lexus IS 350 is redesigned. Highlights include assertive new styling, a larger, gorgeously crafted interior and a longer equipment list. If you've been wanting a roomier IS sedan with a high-end interior, the revamped 2014 Lexus IS 350 is right up your alley. It's less convincing as a sport sedan, however, and more demanding drivers will likely prefer its European rivals. The Lexus IS 350 is the compact sport sedan entry from a  brand known for its ultra-refined luxury sedans and high reliability ratings.  It does battle with some very popular European-brand sedans that have elevated  consumers' expectations in the entry-level luxury sedan class. From our  standpoint, strong acceleration, solid fuel economy, sporty handling and  luxurious accommodations are all baseline requirements for a six-cylinder  compact luxury sedan in 2014. Last year's IS 350 was certainly quick, but its  interior was cramped and, apart from its speed, it wasn't especially memorable  to drive. The redesigned 2014 Lexus IS 350 features notable upgrades, including  a new interior with richer materials, a bigger backseat and a longer equipment  list.
The 2014 IS 350's overhaul starts with provocative new sheet  metal (the new IS wears the brand's audacious double-spindle grille design  better than the larger sedans) and a stiff new structure similar in design to  the larger, more expensive midsize GS 350's. Those more robust underpinnings  made it easier for Lexus engineers to tune the IS for a comfortable ride. In addition, the 2014  model's longer wheelbase has allowed the company to carve out more room for  passengers. Equally striking is the investment Lexus made in the interior  furnishings. The quality of the materials and the overall attention to detail  is as impressive as anything you'll see in this class. We're not as  enthusiastic about the newly available Remote Touch mouse-style infotainment  interface, however, as it's distracting to operate while on the move.
There's little doubt that the 2014 Lexus IS 350's increased  size and feature content makes it a better luxury car, but as in past years, we  find it less successful as a sport sedan. Despite the undeniably stout  performance from its carryover 3.5-liter V6, superb steering that equals or  betters its vaunted German rivals and the available F Sport package that brings  more aggressive styling and a sport-tuned suspension, the IS 350 still lands on  the luxury end of the sport sedan spectrum. Our biggest criticism has to do with  the handling: Even with the F Sport treatment, the IS simply isn't very  engaging to drive around turns. Its automatic transmission's slow shift  response in manual mode doesn't help either.
Of course, if you're just looking for an elegant  entry-luxury sedan to drive to work, you might not care that the 2014 Lexus IS  350 isn't as thrilling on a back road as the best-selling 2014 BMW 3 Series,  which we consider the leader of this class, or the similarly athletic Audi A4. This is a  segment rich with choices, though, and we advise consumers to try all these  sedans, along with the Mercedes-Benz C-Class, Cadillac ATS and  Infiniti Q50, before making a decision. The 2014 Lexus IS 350 comes with a 3.5-liter V6 generating  306 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. An eight-speed automatic  transmission is standard for rear-wheel-drive models, and a six-speed automatic  is used for all-wheel-drive cars. Either transmission gets steering-wheel  paddle shifters to enable manual shifting when desired.
In Edmunds.com acceleration testing, a rear-wheel-drive IS  350 ran from a standstill to 60 mph in 5.9 seconds. This level of performance  is about average for its class, but more vitally, it trails its BMW and  Infiniti rivals by about a half-second.
The EPA estimates the rear-wheel-drive IS 350 will deliver 22 mpg  combined (19 mpg city/28 mpg highway). On Edmunds' highway-biased 120-mile  evaluation loop, we earned 26 mpg. The all-wheel-drive IS 350 is rated at 21 mpg  combined (19 mpg city/26 mpg highway). The 2014 Lexus IS 350's standard safety equipment includes  antilock disc brakes with brake assist, traction and stability control, front  seat side airbags, front knee airbags, side curtain airbags and dual rear-seat  side airbags. In Edmunds testing, an IS 350 required 123 feet to stop from 60  mph, which is an average distance for this class of car with all-season tires.
Safety Connect, the brand's onboard automatic safety and  security service, incorporates collision notification, stolen-vehicle locator  and roadside assistance from a cellular connection with a response center. Optional  safety upgrades include a rearview camera, blind-spot monitoring and rear  cross-traffic alerts, and a lane-departure warning system. The optional adaptive  cruise control brings a pre-collision warning system that can initiate automatic  braking and prepare other safety equipment to help mitigate crash severity.
In government crash tests the 2014 Lexus IS 350 earned a rating  of five stars overall with four stars in front crash tests, five stars in  side crash and rollover tests. The Insurance Institute for Highways Safety gave  the 2014 IS 350 a rating  of ""Good"" in moderate overlap front and side tests. The 2014 Lexus IS 350's 3.5-liter V6 is unchanged from last  year, save for the addition of an intake sound generator that gives the engine  a particularly satisfying note when you're accelerating hard. This is a potent  engine with noticeably smooth power delivery, and most buyers will be quite  happy with the IS 350's straight-line performance. The new eight-speed  automatic transmission is highly effective and practically invisible in normal  driving.
One particular delight is the IS 350's well-tuned steering. While  matching a BMW 3 Series in precision, the Lexus actually surpasses the BMW's steering  in its feedback and tactility. However, ride quality was the overriding  priority in this redesign and certainly ride comfort has improved almost to the  level of the larger Lexus GS sedan. And although the Lexus is steady and secure  going around turns, it still isn't as athletic or as fun to drive as the BMW.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because when you're just commuting to the  office, the 2014 Lexus IS 350 is a convincing and enjoyable luxury sedan. The  available F Sport package is a reasonable option for those who want a bit more  performance potential without sacrificing everyday comfort. The 2014 Lexus IS 350's redesigned interior increases the  car's luxury quotient and addresses a major fault in the previous-generation IS  350: a small, hard-to-access backseat. The additional 1.6 inches of rear-seat  legroom is immediately noticeable, and adults will have an easier time getting  in and out. The rear seat also folds in a 60/40 split, a convenience the  previous IS 350 never offered. Trunk capacity is 13.8 cubic feet, which is  above average for this class.
Interior fit and finish was never a problem for the old IS,  but the 2014 model brings upgrades to the brand's already high standard. The  upper dashboard armrests, steering wheel, and even the sides of the center  console (where knees tend to rub) are swathed in dense, high-quality padding.  The front seats are brilliantly supportive yet supple, but those with larger  frames might feel slightly snug.
The new dashboard and center console design is attractive  and contemporary, and enhances the interior's feeling of spaciousness. The  audio and climate controls are set at an angle to minimize sun glare, and the  high-quality buttons and knobs are easy to use.
The 2014 IS 350's one interior foible is the Remote Touch  control interface. Inspired by a computer mouse, this controller is the primary  method for making audio and navigation selections in models with the optional  Navigation package. Although the 7-inch display is sharp, cursor control with  the Remote Touch controller is wobbly, particularly when you're on the move.  Making matters worse is the lack of a hard ""back"" button and the fact  that all the icons are the same color. Fortunately, the IS 350 has standard  voice recognition for many infotainment functions and the navigation system  expands on that. Bottom line, voice control is a vital redundancy here. 
Standard equipment for the 2014 IS 350 includes 17-inch  wheels with all-season tires, HID headlamps, LED daytime running lights and brake  lights, heated side mirrors, moonroof, keyless ignition and entry, dual-zone  automatic climate control, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, eight-way  power front seats (heated for the IS 350 AWD), leatherette premium vinyl  upholstery and a 60/40 folding rear seat with armrest.
A new Safety  Connect telematics system comes with the standard eight-speaker sound  system, delivering weather and traffic information (when in metro areas) free  of charge via the audio system's HD radio. Also standard for all IS 350 models  are a 7-inch color display, Bluetooth phone and  audio connectivity, voice recognition for most infotainment operations, satellite  radio, an auxiliary audio jack and iPod/USB connections.
The first of the 2014 IS 350's three option groups is a  Premium package that includes LED headlights and heated and ventilated front  seats. The Luxury package adds blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic  alert, auto-dimming side mirrors, rain-sensing windshield wipers, perforated  leather upholstery, wood trim, a power tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and  driver-seat memory.
Atop the option-group food chain is the F Sport package.  Available for the first time for both rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive  versions of the IS 350, F Sport brings LED headlamps; a full-mesh treatment for  the grille and revised front bumper; 18-inch wheels (with either summer or  all-season tires); sport-tuned suspension; upgraded brake pads;  multi-adjustable sport seats, perforated leather trim on the steering wheel and  shift knob; a special sport-oriented adaptive instrument cluster; and aluminum  trim for the pedals and door scuff plates. On rear-drive models, the package  also includes an adaptive suspension and a more aggressive Sport S+ setting for  the drive mode selector. Variable-ratio steering can be added as a stand-alone  option on rear-drive IS 350s equipped with both the F Sport package and a power  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel (via the Luxury package).
The Navigation package incorporates the Remote Touch  mouse-type controller for the entire infotainment suite, plus a navigation  system. This package also provides a rearview camera, real-time traffic  information, automatic phonebook download for Bluetooth phones and Enform enhanced  telematics with smartphone app integration (including Bing, Yelp, Pandora and iHeartRadio). An upgraded 15-speaker Mark Levinson  audio system can be bundled with the navigation system.
Additional stand-alone options for the 2014 IS 350 include a  rearview camera (for models without the navigation system), 18-inch wheels,  adaptive cruise control (bundled with a pre-collision system), a lane departure  warning system, and front and rear parking sensors.",V6 cylinder ,190," 277 lb-ft @ 4,800 ",rear wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

In an era when SUVs have  become the de facto family vehicle, the Wrangler is a throwback to rougher and more  rugged off-road vehicles. It's not as comfortable as rival SUVs such as the  Toyota 4Runner or Land Rover Defender, but in return it provides excellent  off-road capability, two-door and four-door configurations, and a removable  top. 
For  2021, there's also something unexpected: a Wrangler plug-in hybrid. Called the  Wrangler 4xe, it has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine plus hybrid components  that provide 375 horsepower plus about 21 miles of all-electric range on a  fully charged battery. Once you deplete the battery's charge, the 4xe switches  over to the gas engine and normal hybrid operation. Plugging in regularly to  recharge can help save on gas, but know that the 4xe isn't a fuel miser like a  Toyota Prius. In fact, the EPA estimates that in normal hybrid operation the  4xe returns about 20 mpg in combined city/highway driving, which is lower than  what you get from most other Wrangler engines.
Still,  we like that Jeep is at least giving you the option of a hybrid. It also helps  the Wrangler stay competitive. In addition to its long-running rival, the  Toyota 4Runner, the Wrangler now has to contend with the all-new Ford Bronco, a  rough-and-tumble SUV that also offers a removable top and doors for those who  enjoy open-air driving. There's also the Land Rover Defender, which takes a  more upscale approach to the off-road SUV formula. Which one should you get?  Check out the categories of our Wrangler 4xe Expert Rating below to help you  decide.
What's it like to live with?
When  the redesigned Wrangler was revealed in 2018, we knew we had to have one for  our long-term test fleet. We ended up buying a top-of-the-line Wrangler Rubicon  Unlimited. We tested it for two years and 50,000 miles. While our Wrangler  wasn't the 4xe you can still pick up plenty of useful information by reading our long-term Wrangler  road test. Jeep only offers the 4xe powertrain with the Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon or Unlimited Sahara. We're partial to the extra capability of the Rubicon, but only if you're actually going to utilize it. Otherwise the Sahara is the better buy. How does the Wrangler 4xe drive? The 4xe, with its turbocharged four-cylinder engine augmented with a plug-in hybrid system, boasts 375 . That's a significant boost over the Wrangler's base V6 and regular turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Our fully charged test Wrangler Rubicon 4xe accelerated from 0-60 mph in 7 seconds. That's respectable, although the regular four-cylinder Wrangler isn't far behind (7.4 seconds). 

   The extra weight of the 4xe powertrain (our test Wrangler weighed 5,275 pounds) does take a toll on braking performance. In a simulated panic stop from 60 mph, our Rubicon 4xe needed 150 feet to come to a complete stop — that's considerably longer than most SUVs need. Otherwise, the brakes are pretty consistent and easy to use for normal driving. 

   The Wrangler Rubicon's off-road prowess is impressive thanks to its big tires, disconnecting front stabilizer bar and lockable differentials. The 4xe has slightly less departure clearance than a regular Wrangler due to the extra protection needed for the battery, but we think that's a small tradeoff for what you gain. How comfortable is the Wrangler 4xe? The robust construction that gives the Wrangler its ready-for-anything personality also contributes to a rough ride  — especially in the off-road-ready Rubicon trim. The boxy design and large tires create a heap of wind and road noise, especially with the optional power-retractable soft-top. We did notice that the extra weight of the 4xe powertrain helped to settle the Wrangler's ride quality on the highway a little.

   The Wrangler doesn't place much importance on passenger comfort, but there are a few highlights here. The front seats are well shaped and remain livable on long trips. The rear bench is flatter and firmer, but it reclines a bit. We like the effective climate system, which also features rear air vents. How’s the interior? Because of the Wrangler's high stance, most people will need the grab handles to get inside. Once inside, you'll find the Wrangler Unlimited has a decent amount of passenger space, but it's by no means roomy. Though there are many controls (especially in the Rubicon and its numerous adjustments for off-road driving), the layout is refreshingly intuitive. The slender pillars and square windows greatly reduce blind spots. 

   The driving position is fairly upright, but there's a useful range of adjustment from the seat and steering wheel. Of course, one of the Wrangler's most appealing features is its removable top. You can get a soft top, a hard top or the handy (but expensive) Sky One-Touch power top that allows you to quickly get that open-roof experience. How’s the tech? The 8.4-inch Uconnect system offers sharp graphics and quick responsiveness. There are plenty of easy-to-access charging ports (USB and USB-C), and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration is supported. Unfortunately, wireless charging is not available and even the upgraded Alpine audio system is a bit underpowered for our tastes.  

   Our test vehicle was fitted with the Wrangler's optional driver aids such as adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning and rear parking sensors. All the systems worked well in our testing, with no false positives from the collision warning system. How’s the storage? The Jeep's narrow body is an off-road strength, but it does limit cargo capacity, compared to competitors like the 4Runner. Even so, the rear seats fold neatly into the floor if you want to carry extra stuff. And there are even six rugged tie-down points and an underfloor compartment. Up front, there aren't many places to store small items, and the door pockets are nothing more than shallow nets.

   Car seats are easy to fit in the Unlimited so long as they're not too bulky — you might have to move the front seat forward to fit a rear-facing seat. The Wrangler can tow up to 3,500 pounds, which is decent for the class, and can be flat-towed behind a motorhome. How’s the fuel economy? If you can plug the 4xe in on a regular basis, and you've got a relatively short commute, it can make good sense. The EPA's estimate for EV range with the 4xe is 21 miles before the engine comes to life. We managed to only squeeze 18.7 miles on our best attempt. 

   The Wrangler 4xe's electrical efficiency — how far it can drive per kWh's worth of electricity — is pretty poor, too, or at least compared to other plug-in hybrids. But you also need to temper your expectations given that the Wrangler Rubicon is shaped like a brick and has big knobby tires.  

   After the electric power runs out, the 4xe is only rated at 20 mpg combined. Ironically, that's worse than almost every engine in the Wrangler lineup with the exception of the V6 with the manual transmission and the V8. On our mixed driving evaluation route, we achieved 20.2 mpg after running out of electricity. Is the Wrangler 4xe a good value? For the 4xe to be a good value, you'll have to be a very specific buyer. Depending on which trim level you go with, the 4xe powertrain can add more than $10,000 to the price of a Wrangler. Thankfully, the 4xe Wrangler qualifies for the $7,500 federal tax credit (as well as a number of state and local incentives) though those incentives won't apply to every buyer. The EPA-estimated 21 miles of EV range should be enough for most short commutes, so that will help with the cost of gas. 

   Build quality is, as it is on other Wranglers, distinct and satisfying. Materials are attractive and have a good tactile feel, but the interior here is the same as on other, much less expensive Wranglers. Jeep's warranty coverage and roadside assistance are average. Few vehicles are as distinctive as the Jeep Wrangler. This is one of the few no-compromise off-road vehicles left. Take that and combine it with a powerful plug-in hybrid powertrain and you've got a distinctive vehicle by pretty much every standard.",Inline 4 cylinder ,115," 470 lb-ft @ 5,250 ",four wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

There's a lot to like, but it's never been  particularly a standout in its class. For 2023, the Corolla Hatchback gets a  number of updates, including redesigned headlights and bumpers and improved  in-car tech and driver aids, that should add a bit to the Corolla Hatchback's  appeal. 
Starting  things off is a new infotainment system for the 8-inch center touchscreen.  Changes start with a quicker processor and sharper-looking graphics. You'll now  get wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration and an improved voice control system that allows you to do more  things, such as adjust the stereo volume and cabin temperature.

Toyota says that many of the included systems, such as  forward collision warning and lane keeping assistance, have been improved to  provide better detection and functionality.
Overall,  we think the updated Corolla Hatchback is a solid pick. But you might want to  also check out the Honda Civic hatchback and Mazda 3 hatchback. The Civic is  roomier on the inside than the Corolla, and the Mazda 3 is more upscale and  offers available all-wheel drive and turbocharged power.  While  we don't always recommend a vehicle's top trim, we think the XSE trim is the best of the Corolla  Hatchback's two available trims.

The compressed natural gas (CNG) conversion is no longer available. Otherwise, the Savana Cargo carries forward unchanged. For many  commercial businesses and contractors, a full-size cargo van is a great  workhorse to get the job done. But of all the cargo vans on the market, the  2017 GMC Savana is perhaps the least desirable in our opinion.   Like its  Chevy relative, the Express, the Savana does offer plenty of towing capacity  thanks to its stout V8 engines. But otherwise the Savana lags behind rival  vans. The Savana's cargo area is small, and GMC doesn't offer different roof  heights for even more room. Its dated design also results in subpar  maneuverability and feature availability. There's simply no compelling reason  to choose the 2017 GMC Savana over its rivals. The 2017 GMC Savana Cargo is a large work van that will handle pretty much anything you ask of it. Unfortunately, rivals do the same and are newer, offer greater cargo capacity and are powered by more fuel-efficient engines. We recommend buying one of them instead. Edmunds has not yet driven any version of this vehicle. The following is our first take on what's significant about it and what you can expect. As in other cargo vans, the Savana's interior makes liberal use of hard plastics. The engine protrudes into the front footwells, a characteristic of old-school vans that rivals have long since abolished. A low roof and no door behind the driver make it difficult to enter and move around the back. The cargo area measures 239.7 cubic feet in the short-wheelbase Savana, a few cubes smaller than the class average. This expands to 284.4 cubic feet in the long-wheelbase version. Competitors offer much more storage room because they can be ordered with even longer cargo floors and higher roofs. The Savana fails to impress on the tech front, with just a two-speaker stereo with AM/FM radio and an auxiliary jack listed as standard equipment. Optional extras include a CD player, satellite radio and a touchscreen interface that's older than what you'll find in newer GMC vehicles. The Savana Cargo is only available in the Work Van trim level, so your starting configuration will be limited to engine, load rating and wheelbase choice. Unless you absolutely need the extra payload capacity, we recommend starting with the 2500 to keep costs down, though it's worth upgrading to the extended-wheelbase version to make up for the Savana's comparatively small cargo area. The diesel engine will likewise keep the Savana competitive with fuel-sipping rivals.  By default, the rear-wheel-drive Savana Cargo is  powered by a 4.8-liter V8 (285 horsepower, 295 pound-feet of torque) paired to  a six-speed automatic transmission. Alternate powertrains are available if the standard V8  doesn't meet your requirements, including a 6.0-liter V8 (342 , 373 lb-ft)  matched to a six-speed automatic and a 2.8-liter diesel four-cylinder engine  (181 , 369 lb-ft) with an eight-speed auto. The Work Van's  standard features include 16-inch steel wheels, 60/40-split opening doors on  the right side, a driver information display, air-conditioning, power windows  and locks, vinyl upholstery and floor covering, LED cargo lighting, six D-ring  cargo tie-downs, a 120-volt outlet, and a two-speaker audio system with AM/FM  radio and an auxiliary jack. Major equipment packages include the Convenience  (tilt-adjustable steering wheel and cruise control), Chrome Appearance (chrome  bumpers and grille), Hotel Shuttle (Chrome Appearance plus the 6.0-liter V8, a  sliding rear passenger door, heated power mirrors, a second row of seating,  tinted glass and rear cargo windows) and Ambulance (6.0-liter V8, a heavy-duty  locking differential and a more powerful battery and alternator) packages. A  separate bundle adds a 6.5-inch touchscreen, navigation, Bluetooth, a CD player  and a USB port. Some of the above features can be added as  stand-alone options. Other options include all-terrain tires, remote locking  and unlocking, remote engine start, rear parking sensors, a back-up alarm, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, cloth upholstery, power-adjustable front seats,  a rearview camera, a  4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, GM's OnStar emergency communications, satellite radio, a spray-in cargo liner, and rear  air-conditioning and heating.

The new IS 300, complete with rear-wheel drive and a 215-horse inline six, chases the BMW 3 Series in the entry luxury sport marketplace, and will continue to do so until a proper manual transmission is available. A fine sport sedan in need of more luxury. Lexus, traditional purveyor of highly refined but generally characterless luxury automobiles, is looking to change its staid, reliable, upstanding citizen image. In 1998, the upscale Toyota division lobbed the GS 400 over the net, scoring with consumers who wanted to blend the sporting V8-powered personality of a BMW 5 Series with daring styling and Japanese reliability. But that serve into opposing territory fell somewhat short of the mark in terms of initial quality and outright performance, and a lack of a manual gearbox represented a glaring omission in a vehicle targeting the vaunted 540i.Has Lexus learned a lesson? The new IS 300, targeting the BMW 3 Series, benefits from the installation of a smooth, 3.0-liter inline six that makes 215 horsepower and 218 foot-pounds of torque at 3,800 rpm. As with the GS 300, whose engine the IS shares, rear-wheel drive is the method of motivation, but for now, we Americans are stuck with a five-speed automatic transmission equipped with E-Shift steering wheel gear-selection buttons, just like in a Formula One car. A manual is on the way, purists, if you can wait a year.So perhaps the lesson hasn't gone unheeded. We get plenty of power, and a row-'em-yourself transmission is just around the corner. But buyers of these kinds of sedans want performance and style. The IS 300 is mostly successful in this arena, with taut, balanced exterior dimensions stretched over large, available 17-inch wheels optionally finished in smoked chrome. We aren't fans of the circular decklid-mounted taillights, and the clear rear lens covers look too much like the ones you see on the neighbor kid's lowered '94 Accord, but the overall shape is well balanced and attractive.Inside is where Lexus gets a gold star for imagination, with a chronograph gauge cluster the centerpiece of a highly styled interior. Drilled aluminum pedals announce the IS 300's intentions loud and clear, while fashionable metallic accents litter the cabin.Double wishbone suspension components front and rear, fine-tuned at Germany's Nurburgring racetrack, keep the standard 16-inch all-season performance tires glued to the ground, while standard four-wheel disc antilock brakes and full-range traction control keep them from sliding and spinning. A limited-slip differential is optional, while standard high-intensity discharge (HID) headlights provide superb nighttime road illumination.Safety is also addressed, with three-point seatbelts for each of the five seating positions and front seat-mounted side airbags standard. Pre-tensioning and force limiting front harnesses maximize protection in a crash, while an interior trunk lid release handle helps prevent entrapment in the trunk.With a base price in the low 30s, the IS 300 isn't the bargain the LS 400 was when Lexus debuted a decade ago. With both Audi and BMW offering all-wheel drive technology in their elegant and smooth-riding compact sedans, not to mention superlative interior materials and manual transmissions, Lexus may have its work cut out for it as it learns what it takes to tackle Germany's finest.",Inline 6 cylinder ,276," 218 lb-ft @ 3,800 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed shiftable automatic

How do you choose between a Chevrolet or GMC full-size van? Which dealer is closest to your house? They're basically the same vehicle. They both stack up well against the formidable Ford Econoline and ancient Dodge Ram Van, so if the Savana provides what you need in this kind of vehicle, buy it. When the then-new Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van. The GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced way back in 1971 (when vans were groovy), and sold steadily until they were discontinued. Competition and safety regulations had forced GM to redo the big vans for '96, but by then Ford had already re-engineered the Econoline twice! To help distinguish the all-new design, GMC rebadged its new van Savana.Savana features flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard four-wheel antilock brakes and dual airbags. Front foot- and legroom is adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of travel. Front air conditioning and rear heat ducts are standard, but for better warming (and cooling), an optional rear heating and air-conditioning unit is available. The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet and storage for items like CDs and cassettes. Savana is available in 135- and 155-inch wheelbases, three weight series (1500, 2500 or 3500) and two (base SL and luxury SLE) trim levels. There is a choice of side-entry doors as well: a sliding door or a pair of 60/40 hinged doors.Inside the short-wheelbase Savana, you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the extended version provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume with the rear seats removed. Up to 15 passengers can be seated within the longer van on as many as five bench seats. Rear hinged doors open a full 180 degrees for easy loading and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened. Gross vehicle weight ratings of up to 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase.The base engine is a 200-horsepower Vortec 4300 V6 that is quieter and more durable this year, thanks to a new roller timing chain and rocker arms. Optional motors include the GM family of V8s, from the popular Vortec 5000, to the venerable 5700, to the monster Vortec 7400. Also available is a robust 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 good for 195 horsepower and 430 stump-pulling pound-feet of torque. A new exhaust system with specially designed catalytic converters help all but the biggest engines meet California low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards. GM's heavy-duty 4L80-E transmission handles all the shifting chores, featuring a more efficient torque converter.Savana's styling is rounded and bulbous, with a front end that mimics GM's truck family and a high-arched rear with D-pillar mounted taillights. Easily as odd-looking as the old Lumina minivan's high-mounted rear lamps, the round-topped rear and sheer size of this van make it seem as if you were looking at the rear of a commuter train car.

Like  the smaller Forester and Outback, the Ascent comes with standard all-wheel  drive and enough ground clearance to help you maneuver in inclement weather or  off road.

Subaru launched the Ascent for the 2019  model year. For 2023, it receives a variety of updates. 
Changes include updated front and rear  styling, with new lighting, bumpers and grille. The Ascent also comes standard  this year with a bigger center touchscreen display.

It offers a  choice of three engines, an impressive voice-command interface, and cargo space  that ranks near the top of the class. After a thorough update last year, the  2018 Escape offers a new trim level that bridges the gap between standard and  luxury models.  The Escape offers optional all-wheel drive,  respectable fuel economy, cargo space that ranks near the top of the class  (only Toyota and Honda offer more) and an available hands-free power liftgate.  You can outfit the Escape from comfortable casual (SE trim with no options) to  rugged luxury (a loaded Titanium model that can breach $40,000). On the road,  its agility instills a level of driver confidence that's rare in this class.  After a more comprehensive update last year that  introduced a new four-cylinder engine and improved things such as smartphone  integration (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto were introduced) and small-item  storage (the lever-mounted parking brake was replaced with a button), the 2018  Escape now offers a SEL trim level that bridges the gap between the more  mainstream SE model and the luxury fixings of the Titanium. Overall, the Escape excels in some areas and falls  short in others. With its turbo four-cylinder, quick (if twitchy) steering, and  tight suspension, the Escape is one of the more engaging compact SUVs to drive,  only outmatched by the Mazda CX-5. Large cargo space and an excellent tech  interface are other advantages. On the other hand, the Escape isn't quite as  refined as the Honda or Mazda, its ""fun"" engine is only available on  its top trim level, and that ""fun"" engine doesn't return particularly  impressive fuel economy.

What's it like to live with?
To  learn more about the Ford Escape of this generation, read our updates from a  full year and more than 20,000 miles of living with a Ford Escape SE. We cover  everything from seat comfort to real-world reliability. We were impressed with  the performance from the Escape's turbocharged 2.0-liter engine but think it  falls short in many other areas. Get the full scoop from our long-term test. Note that while we tested a 2017  Escape, the 2018 Escape is of the same generation and all of our reporting  still applies. Shopping for a small crossover presents a dizzying array of options, but the Ford Escape remains a smart choice in a group of great contenders. It offers a choice of three engines, an impressive voice-command interface, and cargo space that ranks near the top of the class. After a thorough update last year, the 2018 Escape offers a new trim level that bridges the gap between standard and luxury models. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions, although trim levels share many  aspects. The ratings in this review are based on our test of the 2013 Ford  Escape Titanium AWD (turbo 2.0L inline-4 | 6-speed automatic | AWD).NOTE:  Since this test was conducted, the current generation Escape has been updated  with new infotainment features and driver aids. Our findings remain broadly  applicable to this year's Escape, however.  The turbocharged 2.0-liter engine is powerful, and it makes accelerating up to highway speeds and passing slow-moving traffic a breeze. In our testing, an Escape Titanium accelerated from zero to 60 mph in an impressively quick 7.1 seconds. Brake performance is solid and consistent. The Escape is very stable, even during our panic-simulation stop tests. In everyday driving, the brakes offer linear response and feel. It has an artificial steering feel, which is the norm these days for compact SUVs. Still, there's enough feedback to make you feel in control. All-wheel-drive Escapes benefit from an advanced power distribution system that makes the Escape a capable handler as well as a solid all-weather choice. Front-wheel-drive Escapes also feel sure-footed thanks to the well-tuned suspension. In most situations, the transmission responds quickly. It does get caught flat-footed on occasion, but not any more often than most SUVs in this class. We like the Escape's seats because they provide all-day comfort. Heating, an option on some trim levels, is a nice touch. The Escape has a surprisingly comfy ride — surprising because it trades off very little in the way of ride quality in return for its excellent handling. The Escape's turbo four-cylinder is much quieter than some competitors, especially at wide-open throttle. It also remains very smooth even at high engine speeds. The climate control cluster (and LCD readout) feels as if it came from a mid-'90s Taurus, but hey, it works. You'll find large vents up front and center console vents for rear passengers but no temperature or fan speed control. Ford has made it a point to place commonly used controls within reach and in sight, and it shows in the Escape. It may not look very elegant, but everything is where you would expect to find it. The seat height in the Escape is just right. Similar to entering a minivan, there's no bending down to get in. The eight-way power driver seat in the SE trim is a nice touch (changed to 10-way adjustable for 2018). The combination of the seat and a manual tilt-and-telescope steering wheel makes it easy to find a comfortable perch. We had no problems fitting comfortably into either the front or back seats, but the Escape doesn't have a sense of spaciousness like the roomier Honda CR-V. Visibility out the front and the rear is only average. The Escape is definitely not as airy or as easy to see out of as some of its competitors. Build quality is as good as you can expect in a vehicle in this price range. Materials appear durable and well put together. The center console space is much improved as the Escape now has an electronic parking brake button instead of a handle. There are several nooks for devices, keys, cups and bottles, and a deep, narrow center console for larger items. Both front seats have seatback pockets for rear passengers. The 60/40-split folding rear seats fold flat and flush to enhance cargo area and utility. There's no seatback release in the cargo area, so you'll need to walk around to the rear doors, but the seat-side levers make it quick work. LATCH anchors are at the seatback surface, so there's no need to fumble and search under the cushion. Reinforcement anchors in the rear seatbacks are similarly easy to access. Rated to tow as few as 1,500 pounds (base model S) up to 3,500 pounds with the 2.0-liter engine and the optional Class II trailer tow package. The 1.5-liter engine is rated at 2,000 pounds. The SE's optional nine-speaker audio system won't impress audiophiles but should sound fine to most. (We haven't evaluated the 10-speaker Sony audio system.) The navigation system offers clear map views and easy menu functions. Easy Bluetooth pairing. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are now included with optional Sync 3 system. FordPass with Sync Connect app enables various remote functions and vehicle health monitoring, even helps to find parking. AppLink (base model S) enables voice control of various smartphone apps. A rearview camera and blind-spot mirrors come standard, but blind-spot monitoring costs extra. Forward collision alert and lane departure warning and intervention are also optional. Ford's Sync system has excellent voice recognition. It understands just about anything you say and is quick to respond. The Escape SEL is a good way to get near the Titanium's near-luxury offerings while keeping the price affordable. With the SEL, you get some nice features, including a power liftgate, leather upholstery and the Sync 3 tech interface. If safety is important to you, consider getting an SEL with the optional Safe and Smart package, which adds a comprehensive set of advanced driver aids, such as lane departure intervention and forward collision mitigation. The S starts with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder  engine (168 horsepower, 170 pound-feet of torque), a six-speed automatic  transmission and front-wheel drive. Standard features include 17-inch steel  wheels, automatic headlights, MyKey parental controls, cruise control,  air-conditioning, a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, a height-adjustable  driver seat, a 60/40-split folding and reclining rear seat, a 4.2-inch central  display, a rearview camera, the Sync tech interface with AppLink smartphone  integration,  Bluetooth, and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and a USB port. Note  that this model is generally aimed at business fleet buyers and may not be easy  to find on your local dealer's lot. Upgrading  to the SE adds 17-inch alloy wheels  (optional on the S), added chrome exterior trim, sound-reducing window glass, a  turbocharged 1.5-liter engine (179 hp, 177 lb-ft), roof rails, foglights, a  keyless entry keypad, rear privacy glass, dual-zone automatic climate control,  steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters, rear air vents, an eight-way  power-adjustable driver seat (with power lumbar adjustment), heated front  seats, upgraded cloth upholstery, a rear center armrest and satellite radio. Optional  on the SE is all-wheel drive and a  Sport Appearance package that adds black 19-inch wheels, black-painted exterior  trim, LED daytime running lights, paddle shifters, partial leather upholstery,  and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob. The optional Sync 3 tech  package includes an 8-inch touchscreen, enhanced voice controls, Apple CarPlay  and Android Auto, Sync Connect (includes remote app services and onboard Wi-Fi)  and a nine-speaker sound system with dual USB ports. A panoramic sunroof, roof  rail crossbars, a navigation system, and a tow package rated up to 2,000 pounds  are also optional. The SEL bundles all SE equipment and adds a  power liftgate, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, leather  upholstery, power-adjustable side mirrors with heating, rear parking sensors  and the Sync 3 tech interface. Eighteen-inch wheels are optional on the SEL,  along with all of the options available for the SE trim. At the top  of the lineup is the Titanium. It bundles all SEL features but adds a  turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (245 hp, 275 lb-ft), a six-speed  automatic transmission, 18-inch wheels, a hands-free power liftgate, keyless  entry and ignition, remote start, ambient interior lighting, an auto-dimming  rearview mirror, xenon headlights, heated and 10-way power-adjustable front  seats, driver-seat memory settings, a 110-volt, household-style power outlet,  and additional 12-volt power outlets. Also standard are a navigation system, a  10-speaker Sony audio system with HD radio, front and rear parking sensors, and  an automated parallel and perpendicular parking feature (which includes front  and side parking sensors). Titanium  options are similar to SEL options, with the exception of optional 19-inch  wheels and an uprated tow package capable of pulling up to 3,500 pounds.A Safe and Smart package is available for the SE, SEL and Titanium trims, and it includes  adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency  braking, automatic high beams, blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic  alert, lane departure warning and intervention, and automatic wipers.",Inline 4 cylinder ,161," 170 lb-ft @ 4,500 ",front wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

The 2001 Acura NSX is an exotic that still turns heads. Overpriced for what you get, though. Buy a used one and get virtually the same car. Believe it or not, it's been 10 years since Acura introduced this all-aluminum bodied sports car. Back then it received well-deserved accolades for its futuristic construction and true sporting design. It still gets our kudos for being well-balanced, highly poised, easy to drive and graceful, even though you can get more horsepower and a relatively similar ride for half the price from other sports cars.We're not sure why the NSX has to be so expensive. Equipped with a 3.2-liter, 24-valve V6 engine, the NSX manages 290 horsepower (252 if equipped with an automatic), which is enough to move the car from zero to 60 mph in about 5 seconds. The mid-engine design provides excellent weight distribution, keeping the wheels securely planted around turns. Braking is confident and secure with only 122 feet required to get from 60 to zero. The radical exterior (yes, after a decade it's still exotic) of the NSX belies its logical and comfy interior. It's really as comfortable and easy to drive as its distant relative, the Honda Accord. All controls are logically placed, the seating position is ideal and the targa top is easily stored. While never a strong point of mid-engined exotic sports cars, rear visibility is better than you might expect. The shift action of the six-speed transmission (revised last year) thrills us. The clutch and brake pedals are well placed and provide excellent feedback, as does the razor-sharp steering. On a test track it makes us feel like Schumacher.But, we're still not sure why it has to be so expensive.Since its 1991 introduction, other sports cars, such as the Dodge Viper and Chevrolet Corvette, have caught up to the radical NSX, and the 'Vette offers more horsepower at half the price. Even the Porsche 911 is a viable alternative.It seems that Acura may have seen the future once again with the regard to the NSX. The Japanese-based automaker is reportedly developing a more powerful and less expensive version for release soon. Don't write off the current model, though. It still has plenty to offer. Drivers looking for a supercar that likes being driven at the top end of its tachometer while keeping a leech-like grip on the blacktop couldn't ask for more. And don't forget that the NSX is part of the Acura (Honda) family, which means it won't spend most of its time on a hoist with a man making $90/hour whanging away underneath it, like other exotics. Combine that with its livable interior and excellent ergonomics and you've got a keeper that could be used for daily commutes or joyful driving.

The 2011 GMC Yukon is a leading choice for a traditional large SUV thanks to its comfortable cabin and strong towing and hauling capabilities. But for many people, a large crossover SUV might work out better. The 2011 GMC Yukon is related to GM's full-size pickups and shares  virtually everything but styling details with the 2011 Chevrolet Tahoe. As  such, this large, V8-powered SUV is capable of transporting up to nine people  and towing upwards of 8,400 pounds. Though now entering its fifth year since a  complete redesign, the Yukon remains one of the best choices in its dwindling  class of truck-based SUVs. Highlights include a ride that's far more  comfortable and handling that's far more composed than you'd expect from a  truck. Its cabin is also well built, now featuring much higher quality than you  might remember from GM's past big SUVs.
As capable as the Yukon is in the role of family hauler, it's  worth pointing out that a large crossover SUV will likely be a better choice  for most people. The 2011 GMC  Acadia, for instance, drives more comfortably, gets better fuel economy and  has a third-row seat that's roomier, easier to reach and more convenient to fold  into the cargo floor. The Yukon's third row must be physically removed from the  truck in order for you to utilize an otherwise sizable cargo hold. 
Should a more rugged, tow-ready vehicle be needed, the 2011  GMC Yukon (including its high-lux Denali trim) is certainly one of the best  vehicles available. Its Tahoe sibling is another. The 2011 Ford Expedition offers a fold-away third-row seat but isn't as powerful as the Yukon. The 2011 Toyota Sequoia is  probably the Yukon's most serious competitor; it offers a similar mix of  performance and utility. But if you don't expect to have anything beyond modest  towing needs, we suggest checking out large crossovers like the GMC Acadia (and  related Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse), 2011 Ford Flex and Mazda CX-9. The 2011 GMC Yukon SLE and SLT are powered by a 5.3-liter V8 good for 320 horsepower and 335 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive is standard. There are two four-wheel-drive systems available: a single-speed transfer case and a more traditional two-speed case with low-range gearing. The Yukon's Tahoe sibling with four-wheel drive went from zero to 60 mph in 8.5 seconds. Estimated fuel economy is 15 mpg city/21 mpg highway and 17 mpg combined with rear- or four-wheel drive. Depending on drivetrain and equipment, the Yukon can tow as much as 8,400 pounds.
The GMC Yukon Denali gets a 6.2-liter V8 that produces 403  and 417 lb-ft of torque. A six-speed automatic with manual shift capability is standard. In Edmunds testing, a Cadillac Escalade powered by the same V8 as the Yukon Denali went from zero to 60 mph in a quick 7.5 seconds. Rear-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. EPA-estimated fuel economy is 13/18/15.  The 2011 GMC Yukon comes standard with antilock brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags, side curtain airbags and OnStar emergency telematics. Rear parking sensors and a rearview camera are available on all Yukons, while the SLT-2 and Denali can be had with a blind-spot warning system.
In Edmunds brake testing of the related Tahoe, the SUV came to a stop from 60 mph in 134 feet, an average distance for this class of vehicle. In government crash testing, the Yukon received the top five-star rating for both frontal and side-impact protection. The 2011 GMC Yukon excels at highway cruising with a quiet cabin and a suspension that smoothes bumps and rough pavement without feeling sloppy when pointed through corners. Its relatively compact 39-foot turning circle also makes this GMC reasonably maneuverable in town. Still, the Yukon doesn't feel particularly agile in traffic and also exhibits some vagueness in its steering. It feels right at home when towing a trailer, however, cruising effortlessly and easily maintaining speed up long grades. The Denali shares the Escalade's potent 6.2-liter V8 and is thus notably quick for such a sizable vehicle. The GMC Yukon boasts an attractive cabin with high-quality materials. The control layout is simple and straightforward, and the available navigation system is also easy to use despite a smaller screen than newer GM models have. The front seats are comfortable, though the lack of a telescoping steering wheel might be a drawback for some drivers. The Yukon can carry up to nine passengers, making it one of the most versatile utility vehicles in that regard. However, those in the rearmost row will find limited legroom due to a low-mounted seat cushion.
That third-row seat also poses problems for cargo capacity, as it doesn't fold away into the floor. You must either fold the seatback down and place your stuff on top or physically remove the heavy seat from the truck. Once you do, 109 cubic feet of cargo space are available. 
The SLE comes standard with 17-inch wheels, roof rails, automatic headlights, running boards, heated mirrors, tri-zone automatic climate control, cruise control, six-way power front bucket seats (manual recline), a leather-wrapped tilt-only steering wheel, Bluetooth, OnStar and a nine-speaker Bose sound system with satellite radio, iPod/USB interface, auxiliary audio jack, CD player and rear seat headphone jacks. The SLE can be optioned with a 40/20/40-split three-person bench seat that raises seating capacity from eight to nine people. A Convenience package adds rear parking sensors, remote engine start, a rearview camera (with mirror display) and power-adjustable pedals.
The SLT adds foglamps (optional SLE), leather upholstery, the Convenience package and the expanded availability of optional content. Options include an Off-Road Suspension package, heated eight-way power front seats with driver memory and power-adjustable lumbar, ventilated front seats, second-row captain's chairs and a navigation system with real-time traffic and auto-dimming rearview mirror. The SLT-2 Equipment package adds a power tailgate, power-folding mirrors, heated second-row seats and a second-row power seat release.
The Denali adds all the SLT's above optional equipment plus 20-inch alloy wheels, special Denali styling cues, additional interior sound insulation, a heated steering wheel and a 10-speaker surround-sound Bose audio system.

Hyundai,hyundai sonata,1998,hyundai sonata 1998,"['Cheap, functional transportation with a huge rear seat.']",['Lots of engine and wind noise.  Bouncy suspension.'],3.9,"No changes to the Sonata for 1998. Sonata is Hyundai's midsize entry, and faces some very stiff competition in this category.  Ford's Contour/Mystique populates this class of automobiles, as does the Breeze/Cirrus/Stratus trio from Chrysler.  Perennial favorites such as the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Mazda 626 also go head-to-head with this Hyundai. Hyundai's forte to date has been budget prices and standard (or low-priced) luxuries that couldn't be matched by competitors.  It seems those days are over.  The 1996 Sonata GLS we sampled ran nearly $21,500.  True, it was well loaded with automatic, sunroof, leather and power everything, but a similarly equipped Contour SE or Chrysler Cirrus was priced less than the Sonata.  Considering Hyundai's quality record, we don't find the GLS to be a viable option in this class, particularly since the Contour/Mystique twins are a real kick in the pants to drive.That's not to say that the Sonata isn't a satisfying car.  The doors thunk shut nicely, it is quiet and comfortable inside and the leather makes it feel like a much more expensive sedan.  Everything looks and functions as though quality has been built-in, but the radio and climate controls are a tad overdone.  The back seat could benefit from better thigh and back support, but it isn't any more uncomfortable than the rear quarters of a Dodge Stratus.  Overall, we are impressed with this roomy effort from Hyundai.Unfortunately, the Sonata competes with many cars that feel as good and often cost less.  Factor in the depreciation that the Hyundai is sure to endure, as well as the questionable quality levels of past Sonatas, and this new one's shine begins to dull.

Audi,audi a6,2000,audi a6 2000,"['New selection of engines, well-appointed interior, all-wheel-drive stability.']","[""Non-linear steering, questionable exterior styling, 4.2 model's molded rear seat.""]",4.4,"There are two new models joining the A6 2.8 and A6 2.8 Avant. The first is the A6 2.7T powered by a turbocharged V6 engine. The second model is the A6 4.2 powered by a virile V8. Refined and luxurious, the all-weather A6 family offers a satisfying alternative to the BMW 5 Series or Mercedes E-Class -- the 2.7T is our favorite. For 2000, Audi has added two new versions of the A6. Both of them are considerably more powerful than the A6 2.8 Sedan and the A6 2.8 Avant Wagon that were previously offered in America. The A6 2.7T Sedan has a twin-turbo 2.7-liter V6 that produces 250 horsepower and 258 foot-pounds of torque. Audi has used two small turbos rather than one large one to make the engine more responsive. In a nice tip of the hat to enthusiasts, the 2.7T comes with a six-speed manual transmission as standard equipment. A five-speed Tiptronic-controlled automatic transmission is a no-cost option.The Audi A6 4.2 Sedan features the 4.2-liter V8 normally found in the larger A8 Sedan. Obviously Audi's challenge to the V8-powered BMW 540i and Mercedes-Benz E430, this engine produces 300 horsepower and 295 foot-pounds of torque. This engine comes only with a five-speed Tiptronic-controlled automatic transmission. Beyond the engine, the 4.2 also comes with more aggressive styling, bigger wheels and tires, and more standard equipment.For 2000, the 2.8 Sedan and 2.8 Avant get an optional five-speed manual transmission. Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system is optional on the 2.8 Sedan and standard on all of the remaining models. This system constantly monitors the grip of the tires. When one of them starts to lose traction, the quattro system automatically applies power to the tires with the most adhesion to the road surface.All of the A6 models feature an interior that is one of the best in its class. Audi greets drivers with a generous amount of supple materials and features. As a bonus, A6 buyers can choose from three different types of interiors. The atmospheres -- Ambition, Ambiente and Advance -- differ in their use of texture and appearance of the seat upholstery, and the color and type of genuine wood and aluminum trim.The A6's styling is unmistakably Audi, with a swept greenhouse and muscular fenders. However, the A6 isn't a stunner like the A4. The rounded sheetmetal and sharply creased trim detail don't blend well to our eye, and the taillights on the sedan appear to have been lifted from Chevrolet's lowly S-10 pickup. From some angles, the car looks great. From others, it appears somewhat dumpy and jumbled. Front overhang can appear especially out of balance. Fortunately, the gracefully swept greenhouse on both the sedan and wagon lends a touch of class and elegance to an otherwise characterless profile. Despite these nitpicks, we believe the A6 is an enticing choice in the hotly contested entry-level luxury class. If you're looking for a wagon, the A6 Avant should serve nicely. But our personal favorite is the A6 2.7T. This version offers better acceleration than the 2.8 and nearly equals the 4.2. It also doesn't cost much more than the 2.8, and certainly costs less than the 4.2.",V6 cylinder ,142," 207 lb-ft @ 3,200 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed automatic 
Honda,honda pilot,2009,honda pilot 2009,"['Comfortable ride, ample cargo capacity, refined powertrain, adult-ready third-row seat, innovative interior storage.']","['Poor braking distances, not enough power, fuel economy should be better, button-happy stereo and climate controls.']",4.6,"The fully redesigned 2009 Honda Pilot midsize crossover SUV sports more rugged exterior and interior styling along with a more usable third-row seat. The 2009 Honda Pilot looks tougher than its predecessor and offers more room for third-row passengers, but the stereo and climate controls are less than intuitive, and some interior plastics feel cheap. The first-generation Honda Pilot was a trendsetter, spearheading the initial wave of carlike SUVs that gave rise to the crossover SUV craze. The redesigned 2009 Honda Pilot seems designed to set a trend as well -- namely, a trend toward angular, Jeep-like styling in the midsize crossover SUV segment. We're not sure whether it will catch on, but no one will call the Pilot's new look generic. The real question, though, is whether the virtues of the first-generation Pilot -- one of our favorite midsize crossover SUVs -- have been retained.The answer is yes and no. On the bright side, Honda has made a point of enlarging third-row accommodations so that actual adults can fit back there, in part by adding an extra inch of width and 3 inches of length. Traditional Pilot traits like a well-cushioned ride, a smooth powertrain and optional four-wheel drive are also present and accounted for. However, the 3.5-liter V6, which receives only mild revisions for second-generation duty, feels sluggish compared to other V6s in this segment. Despite this lack of power, fuel economy is about equal to more muscular competitors. More distressing, though, were the long stopping distances we observed at our test track -- this alone makes it difficult to recommend the Pilot.Another departure from the past that's not entirely welcome is the 2009 Pilot's befuddling array of buttons for operating the audio and climate control systems, as opposed to the no-brainer layout in last year's model. But those attracted to the new Pilot's distinctive styling may be willing to forgive such idiosyncrasies. Maximum cargo volume remains essentially the same at 87 cubic feet, which should satisfy all but the most haul-happy families. Fuel economy, while still nothing to write home about, has improved a smidge.Competition is stiff in the midsize crossover SUV segment. GM offers the impressive Buick Enclave/Chevrolet Traverse/GMC Acadia/Saturn Outlook quadruplets, while the Ford Flex, Hyundai Veracruz, Mazda CX-9 and Toyota Highlander are equally viable contenders. If we had our way, Honda would have done a little more to distinguish the 2009 Pilot from both the competition and its likable but aged predecessor. It's certainly still worthy of consideration, but unless you're smitten with the new Pilot's tough-guy styling, we'd recommend giving other midsize crossover SUVs a thorough look as well. The 2009 Honda Pilot is powered by a 3.5-liter V6 that generates 250 horsepower and 253 pound-feet of torque -- increases of 6  and 13 lb-ft over last year's model. A five-speed automatic is the only available transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, but all Pilot models are available with an all-wheel-drive system that automatically apportions power to the rear wheels -- up to 70 percent -- when front slippage occurs. This system also has a driver-selectable ""lock"" feature that routes the maximum 70 percent of torque to the rear wheels at speeds below 19 mph.Having gained a few horsepower as well as a few pounds, the 2009 Pilot was projected to be about as fleet-footed as its forebear. Imagine our surprise, then, when our test vehicle loped from zero to 60 mph in a leisurely 9.7 seconds -- that's roughly a half-second slower than the previous-generation model despite similar gear ratios. At least fuel economy has increased slightly thanks to Honda's Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, which shuts down half of the V6's cylinders when they're not needed. According to the EPA, 2WD models should achieve 17 mpg city/23 mpg highway and 19 mpg combined, while AWD models come in at 16/22/18. Standard safety equipment includes antilock disc brakes, stability control, front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. In government crash tests, the Pilot performed flawlessly, scoring a perfect five stars in frontal and side-impact testing. With an even 8 inches of ground clearance -- up 0.2 inch from the previous model -- the 2009 Pilot should make quick work of light-duty off-road tasks when equipped with all-wheel drive. But most Pilot owners are about as likely to leave the pavement as the Pilot is to receive an official ""trail rating."" Around town, the 3.5-liter V6's relative lack of low-end torque makes it feel rather flat-footed off the line. Passing power isn't much better, as Honda's VTEC technology uncharacteristically fails to bring the V6 to life at higher rpm. And although the feel of the brake pedal instills confidence, the Pilot turned in an unacceptable braking performance at our test track, requiring almost 150 feet to stop from 60 mph. That's nearly 20 feet longer than some competing crossovers.Dynamically, the 2009 Honda Pilot feels every bit as big as it looks. There's bountiful body roll, and brake dive is significant even at low speeds. The reasonably precise steering is extraordinarily slow but nicely weighted, and the soft suspension affords a comfortable ride over rough roads and on the highway. The latter traits should endear the Pilot to family-minded buyers. The 2009 Honda Pilot's interior layout is attractive in the same rugged way as the exterior, but it drew split opinions among our staff in regards to whether it maintains Honda's traditional combination of intuitive controls and high-quality materials. The center stack is littered with small buttons that are difficult to decipher at a glance, but some found they become intuitive with repeated use. The main information screen/navigation system's central control knob and related buttons are located at knee level, requiring a potentially unsafe downward glance, but some liked that they fell right at hand level and could be operated by feel. The new Pilot's dash consists of roughly textured hard plastic: Some of our editors appreciated the low-sheen rugged look, while others thought they looked cheap and preferred the richer-feeling materials found in competitors such as the Hyundai Veracruz. Gauges are clear and pretty nifty-looking to boot, while the navigation system is one of the best in the business once you've got it up and running. The sound quality of the uplevel 10-speaker stereo is also top-notch.The ace up the 2009 Pilot's sleeve in this category is its appreciably roomier third-row seat. There are 1.8 extra inches of legroom back there relative to the previous Pilot, and Honda claims that a ""95th-percentile adult male"" can now ride in the third row without issue. We're not sure how happy that guy's going to be about it, but it's true that the new Pilot's third row isn't the penalty box it used to be. Both the second and third rows are plagued by low cushions, though, which means that even moderately long-legged passengers will be forced to adopt a knees-in-the-air riding style. Overall, rival crossovers like the Flex and GM's Acadia/Enclave/Outlook/Traverse foursome offer superior third-row accommodations. There are no available options on LX or EX models. Optional on the EX-L is a DVD rear entertainment system that's packaged with a 10-speaker audio system. The DVD system is the only option on Touring models, which come standard with the 10-speaker stereo.",V6 cylinder ,276," 253 lb-ft @ 4,800 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed automatic

Four new colors are also available. A very capable small SUV thanks to its powerful V6 engine, spacious cabin, handsome looks and car-like handling. The 2002 Ford Escape is one of our favorites. One of the benefits of coming late to the party is that when you do arrive, you can make a big splash. That's what Ford has done with the appealing Escape sport-utility.Designed to battle the Honda CR-V, Jeep Liberty, Nissan Xterra, Toyota RAV4 and others of the small-SUV ilk, the five-passenger Escape's calling cards are a large, comfortable interior and a powerful available V6 engine. As an added bonus, it's also priced competitively. These factors position the Escape for tremendous success in a growing market. Developed in partnership with Mazda, which sells a version called the Tribute, Escape comes in XLS or XLT flavors with either two- or four-wheel drive. Base models have a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine making 127 horsepower and 135 pound-feet of torque. Burdened with people and gear, a four-cylinder Escape is bound to be rather weedy. Fortunately, there is an available 3.0-liter V6. With 201 horsepower and 196 lb-ft of torque, it is one of the most powerful engines in its class, and accelerates the four-wheel drive Escape to 60 mph in less than 9 seconds. Equipped with the V6 and the standard four-speed automatic transmission, the Escape can tow up to 3,500 pounds. Both the four-cylinder and V6 engines are LEV-compliant.As opposed to Ford's larger SUVs, the 2WD Escape is front-wheel drive. The 4WD system can be set to either ""4x4 automatic"" or ""4x4 lock"" mode. In automatic mode, power is applied to the rear wheels only when a loss of traction occurs. In the locked mode, the Escape applies power to all four wheels at all times. The Escape does not have a low-range transfer case, however.Ford hopes that with its sporting, rugged good looks, the Escape will appeal to young families and people with active lifestyles. Don't let the outside fool you, though. Underneath, the Escape is more car than truck. The unibody chassis is equipped with rack-and-pinion steering, a four-wheel independent suspension and four-wheel ABS through a front disc/rear drum arrangement. Inside, the Escape offers a big allotment of space for passengers and cargo. This is truly a five-passenger SUV. With the rear seats removed, the Escape offers 64.8 cubic feet of cargo.

Chevrolet,chevrolet corvette,1999,chevrolet corvette 1999,['High performance.  Daily-driver livability.   Bargain sticker price.'],"['Some cheesy interior bits, slow kick-down with automatic transmission.']",4.9,"A hardtop model aimed at enthusiasts is introduced, and its options list is short. Other Corvettes can be equipped with numerous options including a new heads-up display and a power tilt/telescope steering wheel. More than forty years after the 1953 Corvette debuted Chevrolet introduced the fifth-generation Corvette for 1997.  The C5 almost didn't happen.  Originally scheduled for release in 1993, the Corvette was killed for a short time before performance zealots within General Motors resuscitated the project and made the new car a reality.  With the addition of a hardtop model to the lineup, three different Corvettes are available for 1999.Pushrod power, in the form of a reworked, 5.7-liter V8 engine dubbed the LS1, motivates the Corvette.  Horsepower is rated 345 at 5,600 rpm, while torque measures 350 lbs.-ft. at 4,400 rpm.  The result?  Equipped with the standard four-speed automatic transmission, the Corvette will hit 60 mph in a shade over five seconds.  Opt for the six-speed manual transmission and you'll cut less than half a second off the trap time.  To help reign in the power on slippery surfaces, acceleration slip regulation (a.k.a., traction control) is standard equipment.  EPA mileage figures are phenomenal for a high-powered sports car; the Corvette will return 28 mpg on the highway with the manual tranny.Four-wheel-disc antilock brakes keep stopping distances short with larger rotors than previous Corvettes.  Front tires are 17 inches in diameter, and rears are a whopping 18 inches across, which contributes to an excellent .93g of road grip.  The rubber stays planted well too, thanks to a fully independent, four-wheel short/long-arm height-adjustable suspension.  Optional on coupe and convertible is an Active Handling system, which keeps the Corvette in line even if the driver isn't.Body panels are still composed of a material other than metal, though no longer fiberglass.  Sheet molded compound wraps around an ultra-stiff structure that features a full-length perimeter frame with tubular steel side rails.  The windshield frame is aluminum, and the instrument panel is attached directly to a beefy cross member designed to reduce noise and vibration.  A sandwich composite floor with a lightweight balsa wood core damps noise and vibration while making the floor exceptionally stiff.Inside, a dashboard with analog gauges and intuitive radio and climate controls greets passengers.  Luggage space beneath the coupe's rear hatch glass is an incredible 25 cubic feet, made possible with the use of dual mid-ship mounted fuel tanks that are snuggled within the Corvette's structure.  Even the hardtop and convertible can tote more cargo than any Corvette in history.  Inside, the car feels more airy, thanks to a narrower door sill and taller height combined with a low cowl.Improvements for 1999 are few but significant.  Aside from the introduction of the enthusiast-oriented hardtop model, a heads-up display (HUD) and a power tilt and telescoping steering wheel can be purchased for installation on the coupe and convertible.  Also available on those two models is Twilight Sentinel, an automatic headlight system.  Red Magnetic Metallic paint is optional for those wishing to spend extra money on such things.Yes, the Corvette is an outstanding effort and competes favorably with the best in the class.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a million bucks, to our eyes.  Long, low, and lean, the Corvette is certainly attractive.  We take issue, however, with the thick truncated tail and the odd-looking air scoops for the front brakes.  Other critics have complained of derivative styling cues and the lack of chrome-finished exhaust tips.  Still, the Corvette's new shape will wear well into the next century, particularly in convertible format.Don't let the fact that the C5 will swallow two golf bags sway you into thinking this a gentrified sporting coupe.

There are some good midsize SUVs available. This is not one of them. The Honda Passport has been quietly going about its business for the past eight years. While the bulk of attention in the mid-sized sport-ute segment is directed toward the Ford Explorer, Toyota 4Runner, Dodge Durango and Nissan Pathfinder, the Passport has evolved to offer a combination of power, space and versatility that, if not compelling, at least comes in an attractive wrapper.The Passport first arrived in 1993 as a re-badged Isuzu Rodeo, an arrangement that allowed Honda to get in on the hot SUV craze without engineering its own truck. In 1998, the Passport was completely redesigned. Still built by Isuzu in its Lafayette, Ind. plant, the Honda got bigger inside, more comfortable and more powerful. The standard 205-horsepower 3.2-liter V6 makes 214 foot-pounds of torque at a relatively low 3,000 rpm, providing enough get-up-and-go to satisfy most weekend warriors. But with no optional V8 engine available, the Passport compares poorly to other models in this class. Even the Pathfinder's V6 makes up to 250 horsepower.The content-heavy base LX, dressed-up EX and luxurious EX-L trim levels are available with two- or four-wheel drive. The 4WD transfer case is a shift-on-the-fly affair operated via a poorly located dash-mounted button. The Passport feels undersprung off-road and mushy on the highway, failing to please in either environment. Isuzu's Rodeo gets a driver-selectable suspension system to help in this regard, but doesn't share that particular toy with Honda.Four-wheel drive models get disc brakes at each corner, while rear-wheel-drive models get discs in front and drums in back. For safety, ABS and dual front airbags are standard on all models. Power windows, power locks, dual power mirrors, cruise, A/C, and an eight-speaker stereo with cassette are also standard. The EX trim level adds a four-speed automatic transmission, foglights, interior woodgrain trim, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16-inch alloy wheels, dual heated power mirrors, power moonroof and keyless remote entry. The EX-L has all that and a four-way power driver seat, leather upholstery and door panel trim, in-dash CD changer and two-tone paint with body side molding.Fit and finish fails to live up to Honda standards, but most materials are of decent quality. You and your passengers will also appreciate the Passport's user-friendly ergonomics. Front seat comfort is lacking, but rear seats are roomy and supportive. With the backseat folded down, 81.1 cubic feet of cargo space is available.Outside, the Passport is a handsome devil. Its square profile has the aspect of compact muscularity, making it a natural campsite companion. The elegant EX-L version, with its multi-spoked alloy wheels, two-tone paint and body cladding, is equally well suited to carry you to the opera.Other makes get all the attention for a reason. Considering that we've had less than stellar experiences with the Passport and Isuzu Rodeo, which is borne out by J.D. Power and Associates' naming the Passport one of the poorest quality vehicles sold in 2000, we recommend shopping for something else. Even if that something else is a Rodeo, which comes with a far superior warranty package.",V6 cylinder ,190," 214 lb-ft @ 3,000 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

The new Grand Cherokee is even more rugged and still offers plenty of luxury for less money.'],4.7,"The 4Runner receives a number of upgrades this year, starting with a new and improved four-wheel-drive system equipped with a center differential and featuring a full-time 4WD mode in addition to the current two-high, four-high and four-low modes. New exterior features include a front bumper redesign, multireflector headlamps and an enhanced sport package with fender flares and a hood scoop on the SR5 model. Inside, a new center console/cupholder design will improve beverage-carrying capacity of the 4Runner and an automatic climate control system will be featured on the Limited models. In 1996, Toyota separated this high-volume SUV from its pickup truck roots. Thus, the current 4Runner shares little with the Tacoma pickup. As a result, engineers have created a refined vehicle without sacrificing tough off-road ability. Generous suspension travel and tread width provide capable off-road ability, ride and handling. The interior is quite roomy, thanks to a wheelbase that is two inches longer than the previous version. A low floor and wide doors make getting into and out of the 4Runner less of an exercise in contortionism than those riding in Jeep Cherokees or Nissan Pathfinders are likely to experience.Two engines are available on the 4Runner: a 2.7-liter inline four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower at 4800 and 177 foot-pounds of torque at 4000 rpm; and a 3.4-liter V6, producing 183 horsepower at 4800 and 217 foot-pounds of torque at 3600 rpm. These figures represent a substantial improvement over the previous anemic four cylinder and wheezy V6. In fact, the 2.7-liter four is more powerful than the 1995 model's 3.0-liter six, and is nearly as powerful as the base engine found in the Ford Explorer XL.Needless to say, all of this adds up to a competitive sport-ute. Safety isn't ignored in the 4Runner, either, which sports dual airbags and standard antilock brakes on V6 models. (Antilock brakes are optional on four-cylinder models.)Overall, the 4Runner is a nice truck which provides the sophistication that we have come to expect from Toyota products with the overall ruggedness more often associated with Jeeps. Prices are high, however, running from $21,000 for a 2WD four-cylinder Base model to over $36,000 for a fully-loaded Limited. This lands the 4Runner Limited right smack dab in Mercedes-Benz ML320, Nissan Pathfinder LE and Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited territory. The competition in this segment is getting fierce and there are plenty of good choices for your money, definitely something worth considering when shelling out such a large chunk of change.",Inline 4 cylinder ,255," 177 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Subaru,subaru legacy,1999,subaru legacy 1999,"['All-wheel drive, all the time.  Sharp styling.  Throaty engine note.']",['Aging interior design.  Too much glossy plastic inside.'],4.1,"Subaru celebrates 30 years of selling cars in the United States by adding special editions to the Legacy lineup. The  L sedan and wagon are available with a package of goodies that includes power moonroof, alloy wheels, rear spoiler or roof rack, body-color trim, power antenna and seat height adjuster. New colors include Sandstone Metallic and  Winestone Pearl. The 2.5GT Limited is newly available with a manual transmission, while all 2.5GT, Limited and Outback models receive standard remote keyless entry. Subaru distances itself from mainstream automakers by emphasizing its all-wheel drive (AWD) models, thus carving out a unique niche which other companies are just now beginning to address.  A wise move, since loyal Subaru buyers stick with the brand partially because of the wide variety of AWD models in  the company's stable.  In the early 90s, the company attempted to steal market share from Nissan, Toyota, Honda and Mazda with bread-and-butter front-wheel drive models.  The two-wheelers failed dismally. These days, Subaru is enjoying rising success in the United States, in part due to consumer awareness of the safety benefits of all-wheel drive vehicles, and in part because of the popularity of the sport utility vehicle.  In 1996, Subaru introduced a jacked-up, duded-out edition of the hot-selling Legacy station wagon.  Called the Outback, it was sold as the world's first sport utility wagon.  (Evidently, Subaru marketing gurus, like much of the buying public, have forgotten the AMC Eagle Sportswagon of the early 80s.)  Since the introduction of the Outback, Subaru sales have climbed steadily each year. If ain't broke, don't fix it, goes the old adage.  Subaru is taking this advice for 1999.  In the summer of 1998, the Sport Utility Sedan (SUS) debuted, essentially a Legacy four-door wearing an Outback costume.  Later, a couple of new 30th Anniversary models available in L trim arrived in showrooms with a power moonroof, alloy wheels, and other standard accoutrements.  New colors called Sandstone Metallic and Winestone Pearl were added to the paint chart, while all 2.5GT, Limited and Outback received standard remote keyless entry.  Also new for 1999 was a manually shifted version of the 2.5GT Limited sedan. Two engines are available in Legacy models.  Brighton and L have a 2.2-liter, 137-horsepower boxer under the hood.  Step up to the 2.5GT, SUS or the Outback and you'll enjoy a 165-horsepower 2.5-liter flat four that provides entertaining acceleration around town, particularly with the manual transmission. Bargains can be had in the Legacy lineup.  The L model comes equipped with cruise control, tachometer,  power door locks, and four-wheel disc brakes with ABS.  The real deal is the Brighton wagon.  With all-wheel drive, a 40-watt sound system and air conditioning all standard, this model is priced much lower  than most other two-wheel drive wagons on the market.  Add some alloy wheels, and nobody will know it's the cheapest Legacy available.  Unfortunately, ABS is not available on the Brighton. Subaru has a good thing going with the Legacy, which offers a little something for everyone.  Roomy, comfortable, and loaded with utility, the Legacy's standard all-wheel drive should make you think twice about that Taurus, RAV4, or CR-V.",Flat 4 cylinder ,195," 149 lb-ft @ 3,600 ",all wheel drive , 5-speed manual

After allowing GM to dominate the full-size SUV arena for years, Ford introduced a vehicle in 1997 that had its sights squarely aimed at the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon.  Ford boasts that its Expedition is superior to the GM full-size sport-utes in every way.  We had the chance to drive many of these brute-utes this year, and here is what we found out.Larger than the Tahoe and Yukon, the Expedition can seat nine people with its optional third-row bench  seat; the Tahoe and Yukon can only seat six.  Unlike the Suburban, which may have difficulty fitting into a standard garage, the Expedition can be handled easier in most parking maneuvers.  The Expedition also has the best payload and towing capacity in its class: 2,000 lbs. and 8000 lbs., respectively.On the road, the Expedition is well mannered.  It's obvious that this is not a car, but compared to the vehicle it replaces, the Expedition rides like a limousine.  Interior ergonomics are first rate and will be familiar to anyone who has spent time in the new F-150.  From the front seat forward, the Expedition is nearly identical to the new pickup.  That's a good thing: we love the cab of the 1997 F-150 with its easy-to-use climate and stereo controls, steering-wheel-mounted cruise control, plenty of cupholders and great storage space. Ford has put a lot of time and money into making this truck the next sales leader in their already dominant light-truck lineup.  We came away impressed and think you will too.  The Expedition comes standard  with dual airbags (a first in this segment), antilock brakes and fold-flat second row seats - features that we feel are important in this increasingly competitive segment.  Our few gripes stem from the powertrain.  After driving a few Vortec-powered Suburbans this year, we've become spoiled by the GM engine's gobs of torque and horsepower.  The Expedition's power output won't be confused with a Chevy Tracker, but it did leave us wondering if we could squeeze one of GM's 5.7-liter powerhouses into the engine bay.  One option that we think everyone should investigate is the lighted running boards.  The Expedition towers above the ground, and entering and exiting this truck will take its toll on most passengers after a few days.We've seen many of these monsters turning up in our neighborhood and after driving the Expedition ourselves we know why.

A hydraulically driven engine-cooling fan improves fuel economy on the 4.7-liter V8 and a quarter-turn fuel cap improves efficiency at the gas station. Limiteds get an AM/FM stereo with cassette and CD player as standard equipment, along with new ""Euro-style"" gathered leather seats as optional. The Trailer Tow Group now includes an underdash connector to make plugging in aftermarket trailer wiring harnesses a snap. Finally, child seat tethor anchors improve the Grand Cherokee's family-friendly nature while a LEV-compliant 4.7-liter V8 makes this Jeep more earth-friendly. A charmer in terms of overall performance, looks and features, only a spotty reliability record prevents us from giving the JGC our whole-hearted endorsement. Jeep's rough-and-ready Grand Cherokee is one of the best-selling SUVs on the market, and it's easy to see why. With ruggedly handsome styling, roomy comfort for four adults, plenty of cargo space, and unsurpassed abilities both on and off the highway, Grand Cherokee delivers what most people want in family transport.Grand Cherokee's Jeep-genetics are obvious with just one glance. A vertical slot grille, trapezoidal wheel openings, and steep approach and departure angles all announce ""Jeep"" loudly and clearly. Outfitted with recirculating-ball steering, a three-link rear suspension and front Quadra Link coil suspension, the truck delivers a stable and carlike ride, and handles like a pro both on and off the pavement.The Grand's standard engine is a 4.0-liter inline six that produces 195 horsepower and 230 foot-pounds of torque. This aged powerplant provides disappointing acceleration and lacks refinement in terms of NVH control. Next step up is the optional 4.7-liter V8 with the new five-speed automatic transmission. We heartily recommend the V8, which brews up 235 horsepower and 295 foot-pounds of twisting force. That may not sound like much. In fact, this hearty power-maker provides acceleration on par with some muscle cars.You'll find standard cloth upholstery inside the Laredo and if you go with the low-buck, no-frills approach, you'll pretty much be able to buy a plain-Jane version of the JGC that'll provide you with decent levels of comfort without breaking the bank. The Limited, however, lets you slide behind the wheel onto leather-trimmed seats (optional on the Laredo) that feature 10-way power-adjustment. We're huge fans of the Jeep's behind-the-wheel stereo controls (standard on Limited, optional on Laredo), the Infinity sound system and the infrared dual zone climate control system that allows the driver and passenger to have separate control settings. The optional Quadra-Drive four-wheel-drive system keeps things moving even if only one tire has traction, and its reaction time is faster than you can say ""stuck."" The Laredo's standard transfer case is the full-time Selec-Trac, while the Limited gets the on-demand Quadra-Trac II. While going off-road may not be something you've considered doing with your just-purchased luxury vehicle, remember that this is a Jeep, the original 4x4, and it hasn't lost any of its go-anywhere war heritage. Its petite dimensions allow it to squeeze through tight corners, and its high 8.7-inch ground clearance makes rock climbing a breeze. We can honestly say that it knocks the pants off of any other midsize SUV out there in terms of off-road prowess. The Jeep Grand Cherokee makes itself at home on the asphalt or in the boonies, and the 4x4 systems make it a walk in the park -- even if it's a rocky one.",Inline 6 cylinder ,160," 230 lb-ft @ 3,000 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Three new colors can be applied to the 1996 Integra: pearls in red, green or black. Honda enjoys the distinction of landing luxury cars in the United States before any other Japanese automaker had even considered the idea.  The Legend sedan, marketed under the Acura nameplate, was an interesting choice over domestic luxury sedans, and was an inexpensive and reliable alternative to European luxury marques.  However, Honda couldn't expect to sell enough Legends to keep its new Acura franchise afloat, so engineers spruced up the Honda Civic platform and introduced the nimble Integra to compliment the bigger sedan in showrooms.Since 1986, when the Integra debuted, it has garnered praise from a variety of automotive and consumer groups.  Integras have always been sporty, practical, fun-to-drive, and reliable.  Needless to say, they are popular cars with a wide demographic group.  The current iteration, which is the third generation of the Integra, is no exception to this rule.These sport coupes and sedans are quick and comfortable, with excellent build quality.  Since 1994, they've sported swoopy, modern styling, featuring quad, circular headlamps.  Unfortunately, the front fascia design is marred by a thick, black rubber molding between the edge of the hood and the fascia, and this cutline is painfully obvious on lighter-colored cars.For 1996, Acura has given the Integra three new paint colors, new aluminum wheel and wheelcover designs, body color side moldings on LS models.  Continuing from last year are dual airbags and antilock brakes, the latter available and standard on the LS, GS-R and Special Edition Integras only.With Acura's legendary reliability, we recommend the Integra, particularly for those on a budget or in need of a set of sporty wheels.

LS versions get a revised stereo and speed-sensitive volume control. Later in the year, a new Special Edition trim debuts. As much automotive fun as you can have for less than $25,000. Financially, it certainly pays to buy in bulk. To own a big-and-bad Ford Excursion, you'll have to pay only about $5 per pound (based on MSRP for a base model). To own a lithe Mazda Miata, you'll have to pay about $9 per pound. But, hey, sometimes you just have to pay more to get the good stuff. While it seems strange to pay over $20,000 for a Miata, the price is still considerably less than those asked for roadsters like the BMW Z3, Mercedes-Benz SLK, Porsche Boxster, and Honda S2000. And while the Miata might not be able to match these cars' absolute performance numbers, it certainly equals or exceeds them with regard to the intangibles. The Miata is about simplicity in design and operation. It's about having fun behind the wheel. It's about feeling free and young on warm summer nights. Not a serious car, the Miata, but that's part of its charm. For 2002, the Miata receives an available in-dash six-CD changer and a perimeter theft alarm when equipped with remote keyless entry. Also new is a standard trunk light, and LS models get a new stereo with speed-sensitive volume control. Last year, Mazda added variable valve timing to the 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, bumping horsepower to 142 at 7,000 and torque to 125 pound-feet at 5,000 rpm. A five-speed manual transmission drives the rear wheels, but a six-speed is optional on LS models. Any Miata can be equipped with an automatic, but if that's what you're considering, perhaps we can direct you to the cute little VW Cabrio. This is a sports car, and an automatic transmission has no business here. Though the Miata's trunk is miniscule when compared to what can be crammed into the latest SUVs, it can handle daily commuting or weekend getaways. The shifter moves with quick and short precision and all of the switchgear is easy to reach and use. White-faced gauges with chrome rings front snug but comfortable seats, which are trimmed in black cloth on base models or a caramel-colored leather on the LS. Base Miatas have black tops, while LS versions get caramel to match their interiors. This year's Special Edition  trim comes in two color schemes - Titanium Gray paint with a deep saddle brown leather interior and Blazing Yellow Mica with a black leather interior, the first ever for a Miata. Standard features on the SE include a six-speed manual transmission, 16-inch Enkei alloy wheels, a 200-watt Bose sound system with an in-dash six-disc changer, and a chrome fuel filler door. Inside, the SE has a two-tone, three-spoke Nardi steering wheel; a Nardi leather shift knob and handbrake lever; white-faced gauges ringed in aluminum; and aluminum pedals, door handles and scuff plates. Mazda will produce just 1,500 Special Edition Miatas in Titanium Gray and 1,000 in Blazing Yellow Mica.Droning trips on American interstates are not the Miata's forte, but with a lowered top and an open road, the Miata has few equals. The engine is perfectly matched to the suspension and steering, making the car a joy to pilot on curving roads. When equipped with the Suspension package (which includes items like a Torsen limited-slip differential and upgraded shock absorbers), the Miata's performance envelope is wider, but some fun is lost in not being able to adjust the tail easily via the throttle. In our opinion, you can utilize 90 percent of the Miata's abilities under normal driving conditions, while a Porsche Boxster driver is lucky to experience 60 percent of that car's potential most of the time.

Toyota,toyota highlander,,toyota highlander 2024,"['Comfortable, quiet ride', 'Easy to see out of', 'Above-average fuel efficiency for a three-row SUV']","['Third row is kids-only', 'Not much cargo space behind the third row']",,"As  three-row family vehicles go, Toyota's Highlander is among the most practical  and easiest to drive. It's easy to see out of and comfortable for both city  driving and long highway trips. High fuel economy for a conventionally powered  SUV is another draw. And if you want a more efficient or bigger Highlander,  there's always the gas/electric Hybrid or the supersized Grand Highlander to  consider. 
Credit  for Highlander's above-average fuel economy goes to its turbocharged  four-cylinder engine, which is an unconventional choice in this class. Most  midsize three-row SUVs use bigger V6 engines, many of which are more powerful.  The Highlander's four-cylinder is noisier and a bit rougher in operation than  the many competitors' V6s, but overall we still like its powertrain. The  Highlander's eight-speed automatic responds quickly and is a good pairing with  the turbo-four's power delivery. The Highlander is available in front- or  all-wheel drive.
We  also like the Highlander's generous allocation of features across its many  trims. Premium features like a 12.3-inch  infotainment screen and a power liftgate are available in the midlevel  trims. And wireless connectivity for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone  integration is standard across all trims.
On  the downside, the Highlander's third-row seats are pretty cramped, and there's  not much space behind that row for storage. Other rivals such as the Honda  Pilot, Hyundai Palisade, Kia Telluride and Volkswagen Atlas provide more room.  But overall, we think the  2023 Highlander is a likable enough SUV to warrant consideration.  Toyota  hasn't released the information on the 2024 Highlander as of this writing.  We'll update our recommendations if anything changes, but based on last year's  Highlander we recommend the midrange XLE trim. For a reasonable  premium over the supporting trims, you get several niceties such as heated  front seats, synthetic leather upholstery, second-row sunshades and a wireless  charging pad.",,215,,,

Front and rear lighting is restyled, and the fascia up front is tweaked and now includes a chrome-ringed grille. An internal trunk release has been added, along with a push-button fresh/recirculate control for the ventilation system. Two new colors replace an equal number of shades that are fading away. Reliable but bland, the 2001 Toyota Corolla is a conservative pick in the economy sedan class. Toyota's venerable Corolla has gone through many changes since it was first introduced in 1968. Over the course of its long life, the Corolla has appeared as a hatchback, coupe, wagon and sedan. The world has seen enough people fall in love with this car to make it the best-selling nameplate in the history of automobiles. Now, while that's neat and all, we're sure that what's really important to you and your wallet is whether this modern Corolla still has what it takes to stomp out its competitors. In short, it doesn't.Dating to 1998, the current Corolla faces stiff competition from the Ford Focus, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, Mazda Protege, and Nissan Sentra, all of which have been substantially redesigned or newly introduced since this particular Toyota was fresh out of the blocks. And they are all more satisfying cars. To help fend them off until the next redesign, the Corolla comes equipped with a zippy, smooth-revving, 1.8-liter, four-cylinder aluminum engine that cranks out 125 horsepower, thanks to a variable valve timing and lift system that Toyota calls VVT-i. VVT-i employs continuously variable intake valve timing to provide greater engine performance, better fuel economy and reduced pollution over a wide rev range. When equipped with a manual transmission, this car pulls strongly. Automatic gearboxes are available too, including a technologically advanced (Not!) three-speed unit on base models.Three trim levels are available on the slightly restyled 2001 Corolla. Base CE, better-equipped LE, and sporty S. The new S model includes ""sporty"" trim, fog lights, fake leather-wrapped steering wheel, and a tachometer with outside temperature display, among other things.This year, Toyota is also freshening the exterior styling in a bid to draw buyers into showrooms. Changes include a revised front end with chrome-ringed grille, new headlights and taillights, and body-colored trim for LE and S models. Impulse Red and Indigo Ink replace Venetian Red Pearl and Twilight Blue Pearl on the color palette. Inside, a button has been added to control fresh/recirculated airflow, and in the trunk, and an internal release handle keeps kids from getting trapped.Our biggest gripe with the Corolla is minimal legroom for both the driver and passengers, and the horribly uncomfortable seats. Center stack ergonomics also aren't up to standards in the class, and the soft suspension keels over in turns, making the tires howl in pain. But the ride is smooth, the cabin is quiet at speed, side airbags are an unusual option for the class, and the parts used in the car's construction exude quality.Few competitors can match Toyota's run-forever reputation and high levels of build quality. But with lots of better cars competing for slices of the econo-sedan pie, Toyota has its work cut out for it in 2001. Especially since the Chevrolet Prizm, an identical twin of the Corolla, is sold with big, fat, juicy rebates at the Chevy dealer down the street.",,563," 125 lb-ft @ 4,000 ",front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

New wheel covers and colors are offered, while remote keyless entry makes it easier to lock and unlock the Jetta.  GLX models have new one-touch up power windows with pinch protection. Volkswagen's sedan version of the Golf, the Jetta, has always been one of our favorite four-doors.  Like most cars conceived in Germany, the Jetta has an uncanny ability to keep the driver in touch with every undulation and irregularity in the road without sacrificing comfort.  It has a roomy cabin, logically laid-out controls and displays and zippy performance.GL, GLS, Trek and GT offer enough oomph to keep most drivers satisfied when equipped with a five-speed transmission.  The optional automatic saps what little power the Jetta has to offer, and we don't recommend it.  Most drivers who want a Jetta will be of the persuasion that eschews the autobox in favor of rowing their own gears anyway because, let's face it, why buy a VW if you don't enjoy driving?Driving enjoyment is what the top-of-the-line GLX is all about.  Sporting a powerful and compact V6 engine, thick alloy wheels and lowered sport suspension, the GLX is a poor man's BMW 328i.  If you have a need for speed, this is the Jetta to buy, but prepare to endure a sore backside.  The granite-like side bolsters of the seat cushion are excruciatingly uncomfortable.This year, modifications are kept to a minimum because an all-new Jetta is due in showrooms for 1999.  New wheel covers, fresh paint colors and convenience items are designed to persuade buyers to buy the 1998.  A Turbo Direct Injection (TDI) model arrived early in the model year, providing outstanding fuel economy in return for an inconsequential loss in power.  Regular four-banger Jettas are a blast once they're moving.  Sharp steering response, a taut chassis and a superb driving position combine to make you forget about the wimpy 2.0-liter, 115-horsepower engine under the hood.Reliability has been a problem with Volkswagens in the past.  Current Jettas come with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty that backs up the powertrain, while free roadside assistance and scheduled maintenance are provided for the first two years or 24,000 miles of ownership.Not that you couldn't afford to fix it once in a while. The sporty midlevel GT (loaded with antilock brakes, power sunroof, premium sound, air conditioning, cruise control and side airbags) doesn't crack the  $19,000 barrier.  Prices like these make the Jetta very competitive with the Dodge Stratus, Ford Contour and Honda Accord.

It's available  with two powerful engines — a standard V8 and a turbodiesel option  — and both can pull massive trailers or haul monster payloads. On the  inside, the Sierra is generously equipped on its base and SLE trim levels and  gets lavish on the top-dog Denali model. This GMC is a comfortable and quiet  truck that can get the job done.  
The  Sierra HD isn't alone in its class, however. The Ford and Ram heavy-duty trucks  can tow significantly more. They also have interiors with more modern  aesthetics along with updated tech interfaces and safety features. A redesigned  2020 model promises to put the Sierra HD back on a competitive footing. Even  so, there's still enough good here to make the 2019 Sierra 3500HD worth  checking out. The 6.6-liter diesel makes massive torque and more than sufficient power, which give it a surge of acceleration off the line. Surprisingly, it does 0-60 mph in just 7.7 seconds. In-town acceleration is more reserved, but there's still plenty of power to get up to freeway speed. The brake pedal feel is strong and consistent in everything other than full panic-stop scenarios. During Edmunds testing, we were able to press the pedal all the way to the floor, which is far from ideal. The steering is well-weighted, but it takes several full revolutions of the steering wheel to turn this rig. There isn't much of a connection between the steering wheel and the tires, but that didn't factor too heavily into our score since most vehicles in this class feel similar. The big surprise is how well this gargantuan vehicle takes turns. There's minimal body roll around corners unless you're going way too fast. In parking lots and tight spaces, it maneuvers well enough for a dual rear-wheel setup, but this truck won't be your grocery-getter. : The low-end torque gives plenty of off-the-line acceleration, and shifts from the six-speed automatic are smooth even under full-throttle acceleration. The cruise control and the exhaust brake keep a good handle on the 3500's downhill speed. Out in the open country, this truck is very drivable. There are several laser-focused full-size trucks with specific tires, suspension and clearances designed for going off-road. This 3500HD dually is not one of those trucks. Four-wheel drive will help with inclement weather, but the stiff suspension and its sheer size limit its dirt-road capabilities. The front seats are well-padded and well-bolstered on the sides for lateral support, while the rear seats are relatively flat. The seat padding in both the front and rear is overly firm, though, and will take some serious breaking in to get comfortable. The stiff leaf-spring suspension means the 3500HD has a rigid, uncomfortable ride when unladen. Load it up with a heavy payload or a big trailer, though, and the ride quality is significantly better. We're giving the latter more weight because we assume a dually is unlikely to be an ""air hauler."" While there isn't as much road noise as you'd expect from the dual rear wheels, there is quite a bit of wind noise from the square front end and big mirrors. The diesel engine rumbles a bit, too, but it isn't particularly grating or abrasive and it's relatively smooth while cruising on the highway. The dashboard is about as basic and user-friendly as they come. The buttons are large and readable, within arm's reach and easy to operate. The solid switchgear contributes to ease of use. The proper grab handles and side steps help with entry, but it's still a tall truck. Most adults will have to do some climbing to get in. Keep in mind that this is pretty standard for the segment. It's not any harder to get in and out of the Sierra than any of its main rivals. The optional power-adjustable pedals, tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and highly adjustable driver's seat mean you can pretty much get the position you want. As with most trucks this big, seating position may be a bit high for shorter drivers, but it isn't a deal-breaker. Pick any seating position in the 3500HD, and you'll have plenty of room to spread out. Headroom, legroom and shoulder room are all extensive inside this massive cabin. Pretty much every crew-cab 3500-series truck provides lots of space, and the GMC is no exception. The massive windshield and door pillars give the 3500 big blind spots. The large towing mirrors help with lane changes, but knowing where this truck's corners are can be tough. A rearview camera is standard, but competitors offer surround-view cameras and the GMC doesn't. The body panels and interior pieces are well put-together, without any rattling, shaking or malfunctioning during our test. There's an abundance of pockets in the front and rear — doors, center console, two gloveboxes. If you can't find a place for your stuff in this truck, you just have too much stuff. Some competitors have smarter slight storage solutions for phones and devices, but only by a small margin. As with pretty much every other heavy-duty truck, the Sierra 3500HD is available with a standard bed (6 feet 6 inches) and a long bed (8 feet 1 inch). Our test truck had the long bed, which allows for a massive amount of cargo space. The rear seats fold up for big interior storage as well. The 3500 can fit three car seats in the back without much fuss. There are two sets of easily accessible lower LATCH anchors and three shelf anchors that are a bit harder to reach. The trick, of course, is hoisting the kids up into their high perches. The 6.6-liter turbodiesel has massive torque and power, but the towing capacities are significantly lower than those of its Ram and Ford competitors. Cruise control, exhaust braking and transmission logic are all very good while towing. When you're not towing your fifth wheel, you can haul any variety of beds, dressers and various household furniture pieces in the back of the 3500HD. The payload rating is only a few hundred pounds below class leaders. The menu logic on the touchscreen system is easy to understand, but it's not the most elegant in the class. The touchscreen responses are slower than with class leaders. While we like the optional 8-inch touchscreen, it doesn't stand out much from rival systems. Our experience with smartphone devices was poor, with many dropped connections over the course of the test. We generally like the interface when it's working, but even then it takes quite a bit of time to load music. It's best to use Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Several attempts to use the built-in voice controls fell short, with a success rate of about 50 percent. It was easier to use the physical knobs and touchscreen controls. That said, Siri and Google Voice can be accessed if you've paired your smartphone by holding the talk button longer. If  you're looking for a capable heavy-duty truck with an impressive amount of  equipment, we recommend the midlevel Sierra SLT. It has a wide range of available option packages along with  lots of standard gear such as leather upholstery, heated front seats and  power-adjustable seats. And if you want Denali-level creature comforts, you can  get most of those as packaged or stand-alone options. For towing heavy  trailers, we'd advise getting the 6.6-liter diesel V8. 
The base Sierra comes standard with a  6.0-liter V8 engine (360 horsepower and 380 lb-ft), a six-speed automatic  transmission, 18-inch steel wheels, an automatic locking rear differential,  xenon headlights, air conditioning, a choice of cloth or vinyl upholstery, a  40/20/40-split front bench with a fold-down center armrest, power door locks  and windows, cruise control, and a tilt-only steering wheel. Also standard are  a rearview camera, Bluetooth, a 7-inch touchscreen, a USB port and a  six-speaker stereo.
From  the base Sierra on up, you also have your choice of engine. A turbocharged  6.6-liter diesel V8 (445  and 910 lb-ft) is available, also paired to a  six-speed automatic transmission.
Many  options are available for the base Sierra. Highlights include a remote locking  tailgate, LED bed lighting, a 110-volt power outlet, satellite radio, and  OnStar services with 4G LTE Wi-Fi.
The  next rung up on the trim-level ladder is the SLE, which adds to the standard equipment with an 8-inch  touchscreen, 18-inch alloy wheels (single rear-wheel models only), tinted rear  windows, a remote-locking EZ-Lift tailgate, remote keyless entry, carpeted  floor, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, full power accessories, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a CD player, satellite and HD radio, and most  of the base Sierra's options.
Next  up is our recommendation, the SLT.  Building on the SLE's equipment, the SLT adds foglights, power-folding mirrors,  dual-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery, power-adjustable and  heated front seats, driver-seat memory functions, power-adjustable pedals, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, remote  start, and a 110-volt household-style power outlet.
For  a luxurious take on your hard-working truck, there's the top level with the Denali. It adds a spray-in bedliner, a  power-sliding rear window with defogger, front and rear parking sensors, a  navigation system, wireless phone charging, a Bose audio system, an upgraded  driver information display, upgraded interior trim, ventilated front seats and  a heated steering wheel.
Many  of the standard features on upper trims can be added at lower trim levels in  grouped packages. Other optional highlights depend on trim level and include  different axle ratios, a bed storage box, tonneau covers, trailering mirrors, a  sunroof, a gooseneck/fifth-wheel trailering prep package, a rear-seat  entertainment system, and a Driver Alert package, which includes front and rear  parking sensors, lane departure warning, forward collision warning and a  safety-alert driver's seat. 
Only  available on the SLT is the All Terrain HD package, which includes 18-inch  wheels, the Z71 off-road suspension, skid plates, front and rear parking  sensors, and a heated steering wheel. A separate Suspension package (available  on the SLE and the SLT) offers hill descent control, skid plates, specially  tuned shock absorbers and unique styling treatments.",,161," 380 lb-ft @ 4,200 ",rear wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic

The Savana's underpinnings are body-on-frame rather than unibody, making it the only van left on the market with that setup (aside from its twin brother, the Chevy Express). That setup, however, sacrifices comfort, leaving passengers with a stiff, bumpy ride. On the inside, the interior is cheap and dated. There aren't any roof-height options to choose from like you get from more recently redesigned rivals.  If you're looking for sheer capability, though, the 2020 Savana stands out for its available 12- and 15-passenger seating configurations (thanks to two body lengths). The heavy-duty underpinnings also mean it's capable of towing as much as 9,600 pounds. And depending on configuration, you can take the rear seats out and you've got 255 cubic feet of cargo space. The 2020 GMC Savana is lacking in the modern-charm department, but it makes up for some of its drawbacks with a bit of brute force and some old-school tenacity. Since there are a wide variety of configurations available on the Savana, it's best to choose based on your needs first, then your desired equipment. For maximum towing, we recommend the optional 6.0-liter V8 engine. From there, if additional cargo or passenger space is a priority, you can upgrade to the extended-wheelbase model.

No other changes are in store for the 2002 Toyota Tundra. The 2002 Toyota Tundra is a full-size pickup suited more for the general consumer than for commercial use. Since Toyota is the maker of America's best-selling sedan, it must have been frustrating for the company in the '90s to see domestic automakers reaping huge benefits from full-size pickups, especially since the closest thing to a full-size pickup truck previously offered by Toyota was the poorly received T100. But the company learned from its mistakes, and the result is the full-fledged maximum-sized Tundra.Now three years into its current life cycle, the Tundra is capable of running with the big dogs. Though smaller than most V8s in this class, the smooth-revving and ultra-refined 4.7-liter makes 245 horsepower and 315 pound-feet of torque and is available only with a four-speed automatic transmission. Payload capacity is 2,000 pounds and towing capacities for the V8 start at 5,000 pounds (it goes up to 7,000 pounds with an optional tow package). A 3.4-liter dual overhead-cam V6, making 190  and 220 lb-ft of torque, is standard on regular-cab Tundras, and may be mated to either a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission.Toyota has failed, in some regards, to meet the demands of current truck buyers when it comes to configuration. The Tundra is available in regular and extended-cab versions. Unfortunately, regular-cab versions come only in longbed form, while extended-cab models come only as shortbeds. The latter does include two ""suicide"" doors for easier rear-seat access (which, by the way, is what Toyota calls its four-door Tundra layout: Access Cab), but the space back there is smaller in comparison to that of trucks from Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge and GMC. Those domestic truck-makers also let the buyer build a pickup to meet specific style and creature comfort needs, ranging from bare-bones work trucks to luxury-lined haulers. Toyota gives you three trim levels and a comparatively sparse option list, though dealers will likely be happy to load you up with running boards and gold packages if given the chance.Inside, the Tundra feels a bit more compact than its American counterparts, lacking adequate seat-track travel and a seat height adjuster (in the volume-leading SR5 Access Cab) for optimal comfort when taller drivers are behind the wheel. Rear seat room is also tight, with legroom at a premium for anyone of average height. Tundra's cabin does offer a quiet ride that surpasses competing trucks, as well as many cars, and options like leather seating and a CD changer further contribute to the Tundra's relaxing internal environment for shorter folks. But interior plastics come straight from the Corolla parts bin, and many have a cheap feel and luster that no amount of cowhide can mask. We wish Toyota offered more variety in areas like configuration and option packages, and an increase in cab space would help the Tundra compete better with the extended cab models from GM, Ford and Dodge. Still, the fact that a V8-powered pickup can now be had with a Toyota nameplate on it means that there's a new sub-set of rules for America's truck buyer.",,156," 220 lb-ft @ 3,600 ",rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Bmw,bmw x3-m,2021,,,"['Excessively stiff ride, even in the softest suspension setting', 'Tire roar on the highway can be wearing on long drives']",4.7,"A pumped-up version of the standard X3, the 2021 BMW X3 M offers more power, more high-performance parts, and more exclusivity than the standard car. Under the hood of the X3 M is a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine that produces 473 horsepower. Not enough? Go for the X3 M Competition version that ups the ante to 503 . It also comes with a few extra performance enhancements such as thicker suspension stabilizer bars and an upgraded exhaust. 
BMW still keeps an eye toward luxury. Much like the standard X3, the X3 M offers a plush and practical interior. It comes with plenty of standard features, but of course you can add even more high-end features that are available in packages or as stand-alone options. But how much does the X3 M's harsh ride overwhelm this small luxury SUV's appeal? Read our Expert Rating below to learn more.  Stick with the standard X3 M. The ride quality is better, and you still have that staggeringly swift acceleration from the 473- turbocharged six-cylinder. Also check out the Driving Assistance package and the Executive package if you want maximum-level tech and some extra creature comforts. How does the X3 M drive? This hopped-up X3 does its M badge justice. We tested the Competition model with its 503-horsepower motor. In our testing, it sprinted to 60 mph in 3.8 seconds and ripped through the quarter-mile in 11.9 seconds at an impressive 116.4 mph. It's fast, though other high-performance SUVs are similar — the Mercedes-Benz AMG GLC 63 S and Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio logged identical 0-60 sprints of 3.5 seconds. 

   Braking performance is impressive. Our X3 M stopped from 60 mph in a scant 104 feet. The brakes are also smooth in daily driving situations. High levels of grip are on offer, and the X3 M pulled a stunning 0.99 g on the skidpad. As exciting as all that grip may be, the X3 M, like BMWs in general, offers nearly zero feedback through the steering wheel. That critical lack of feel can prevent you from having the utmost confidence during spirited driving.

   Around town, you'd be hard-pressed to remember you're in a 503- SUV. The main issue is a trigger-happy gas pedal. It's tricky to pull away from a stop smoothly. How comfortable is the X3 M? The X3 M Competition has special sport front seats. They're comfortable and remain so after long distances. They also have heating and ventilation, although we found the ventilation fans a bit noisy. 

   It's a good thing the seats are as comfortable as they are because the ride most certainly is not. You expect to have a firm ride in such a high-performance vehicle, but the X3 M Competition's ride borders on punishing on anything but an immaculate surface. 

   This SUV, though, is remarkably quiet. The only constant source of noise is roar from the wide performance tires. Engine noise is nicely subdued with just enough growl to enhance the driving experience without being obnoxious. How’s the interior? The X3 M has the same general interior design as the regular X3. One noticeable difference is the gear shifter, which is the same one BMW puts in the M5. It has a unique gear-selection pattern that continually caught us out. Can we just have a normal shifter, please? 

   The other sources of frustration are also located in the center console area. The high-gloss black plastic around the shift lever causes excessive glare on sunny days. Also, there are too many flush-mounted buttons. Their similar shape and size make it difficult to locate the right one while you're driving. Otherwise, all the hallmarks of a standard X3 are here, including a spacious interior for all passengers, expansive forward and side visibility, and a comfortable driving position. How’s the tech? The X3 M uses the same infotainment system as the standard X3. That's a good thing — we like the crisp graphics and fairly intuitive and easy-to-use control knob. Unfortunately, the system doesn't support Android Auto smartphone integration, though it should be coming for 2021. Wireless Apple CarPlay is included, and wireless charging and onboard Wi-Fi are options.

   The X3 M also comes with a high-quality Harman Kardon audio system and BMW's excellent voice recognition system. Adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go capability is still part of an option package. We experienced a few false alarms from the X3's frontal collision mitigation system (it applies the brakes automatically to stop the vehicle to avoid or minimize a collision) that resulted in unneeded braking. How’s the storage? BMW didn't diminish the X3's already excellent practicality in the conversion to M duty. There's still 28.7 cubic feet of storage behind the rear seats. Fold them down and you get 62.7 cubic feet of space. That's considerably more than competitors such as the Porsche Macan Turbo, Mercedes-Benz AMG GLC 63 and Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio.

   Up front, there's ample space from various pockets and cubbies to store smaller items. Even rear passengers have fairly generous door pockets for drinks and larger items. And thanks to the spacious back seat and easy-to-access anchor points, installing a child safety seat is straightforward. How’s the fuel economy? The X3 M Competition has an EPA estimate of just 16 mpg combined (14 city/19 highway). But in our time with this super SUV, we found it quite easy to exceed the EPA's estimates. On our 115-mile mixed-driving evaluation route, we saw a credible 19.1 mpg. And that included some fairly brisk driving. City mileage was closer to 16 mpg, but if you use a light foot, the X3 M won't need fuel as often as you might expect. Is the X3 M a good value? With the X3 M40i offering a good deal of performance and the X3 M Competition not offering much in the way of luxurious upgrades, you might wonder if the M Competition's extra price is worth the money. But if you're into high-performance hardware, the M Competition is worth every penny. From the bespoke motor to the trick M5-sourced driveline parts, the M Competition delivers the goods and is definitely special. 

   Even with all the unique performance parts and amazing engine, BMW still offers its standard warranties of four years/50,000 miles for basic and powertrain protection. That's average for the segment, but the four years/unlimited miles of roadside assistance and three years/36,000 miles of free maintenance are above average. If you set out to build a perfect modern-day sleeper — something capable of incredible speed but without any hint of its capability — you'd likely wind up with the X3 M Competition. The engine makes a thumping 503  yet uses a stealthy exhaust system so as to not alert the authorities (or your neighbors). It rivals an all-wheel-drive sports car in traction and handling capabilities too. 

   There are other high-performance SUVs that shout louder and likely handle a bit better, but the low-key packaging of the X3 M and tremendous performance envelope make this SUV a compelling option.",,145," 442 lb-ft @ 2,600 ",all wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

But as prevalent as EVs are,  they can't yet do everything. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles offer zero tailpipe  emissions, just like EVs, plus the ability to refuel quickly. The 2022 Hyundai  Nexo is one such EV alternative and one of only a handful of hydrogen cars on  the market. 
The  Hyundai Nexo is an SUV that sits roughly in between the compact Tucson and the  midsize Santa Fe in terms of size. Its electric motor produces 161 horsepower  and 291 lb-ft of torque, while its hydrogen fuel cell and tank provide up to  380 miles of range depending on trim. Like every other fuel cell-powered car,  the Nexo is only available in California.
Inside,  you'll find an impressive complement of tech features, including a 10.25-inch  touchscreen infotainment system, wireless charging and adaptive cruise control.  Of course, you'll pay a hefty premium for those niceties and the Nexo's  futuristic drivetrain. Hyundai gives you three years of free fuel, though with  the limited number of hydrogen filling stations you probably shouldn't plan on  going too far.
Fuel  cell vehicles are rare. The Toyota Mirai is now the Nexo's only hydrogen  competitor since the Honda Clarity is no longer available. The Mirai is a  sedan, so the Nexo has the utility advantage. Among this small group, the Nexo  is the most practical and the best value proposition. However, hydrogen in  general isn't ready for prime time due to the limited refueling infrastructure  and high vehicle cost. You're  going to spend a lot to get into a base Nexo, so you may as well fork over a  few extra grand to get the top-of-the-line Limited model, which comes loaded with amenities like ventilated front seats, a  heated steering wheel, hands-free liftgate, sunroof, 360-degree camera, and  front and rear parking sensors.",,252, 291 lb-ft ,front wheel drive , 1-speed direct drive

Fresh off a recent  redesign, not much has changed for the 2021 S8, but the once optional summer  performance tires are now standard equipment.  
The  S8 also benefits from rear-wheel steering, which makes this big sedan not only  more maneuverable in tight spaces but also improves high-speed handling and  stability. If you'd prefer not to drive, and instead be driven, the S8 can be  configured with reclining rear seats with heating, ventilation and massage  capability. Foldout trays and footrests are also available, of course.
You  might think that German manufacturers have the fast executive sedan on  lockdown. Options such as the BMW-based Alpina B7, Porsche's Panamera GTS and  the recently redesigned Mercedes-Benz S-Class are so good it seems almost  pointless to look elsewhere for a super sedan. But if you're feeling brave and  want a bit of extra style, Maserati's new Quattroporte Trofeo offers similar  performance along with distinctive Italian flair. We  wouldn't shy away from recommending the S8,  which comes well equipped, without the need for additional options.

The 2022 Acura NSX  is a two-seat coupe with an exotic powertrain, unrelenting thrust and striking  good looks. Acura's most prestigious vehicle is a supercar through and through. 
There  are no fewer than four motors powering the NSX. A twin-turbocharged V6 and  electric motor send power to the rear wheels, while the fronts each enjoy an  electric motor of their own. Last year's NSX was among the quickest cars we've  ever tested — it sprints from  zero to 60 mph in 3.1 seconds — and this year's Type S is claimed by  Acura to be even quicker. 
Introduced  to commemorate this NSX generation's final year of production, the Type S  boasts 600 horsepower, a slight boost from last year's 573 . Maximum torque  rises from 476 lb-ft to 492 lb-ft. The NSX also comes with a bevy of enhancements for  increased track performance, such as revised suspension tuning, a uniquely  calibrated transmission for quicker shifts, and an aerodynamic body kit. Acura  says worldwide production is capped at 350 units, with 300 of those going to customers in the U.S.
There  are some drawbacks to the NSX, such as a clunky touchscreen interface and a tiny cargo area that gets hot during driving. Otherwise, the NSX is an exceptional  supercar that offers an incredible amount of performance at a much lower cost  than a rival Lamborghini, McLaren or Porsche.

On standard Sierras, the previously optional Z85 firm-ride suspension is now standard on all 1500 models for improved handling and towing capacity. Base SL models now include air conditioning while uplevel SLE and SLT models add deep-tinted glass to the standard feature list. GMC advertising claims Sierra is a ""professional grade"" truck. With stout engines, roomy cabs and rugged good looks, the Sierra impresses. But the cabin is constructed of rather cheap parts, and we've found fit-and-finish concerns on several Sierras. That doesn't spell ""professional grade"" to us. Now entering its fourth model year in current guise, GMC's full-size Sierra pickup continues along the refinement trail for 2002. While it shares a platform and components with Chevrolet's Silverado, the Sierra benefits from styling and feature enhancements to position the GMC as a ""professional grade"" truck.Looks and special content aside, the biggest draw for GMC's half-ton pickup is a first-class engine lineup. The base Vortec 4.3-liter V6 provides a solid 200 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque for light-duty towing and hauling. If a V8 is more to your liking, there are two to choose from. A 4.8-liter V8 rated at 270  and 285 lb-ft of torque is standard on all half-ton extended cab Sierras. For a little extra get up and go, order the 5.3-liter V8 rated at 285  and 325 lb-ft of torque. Both engines move the Sierra along with surprising speed while delivering as much as 20 miles per gallon on the highway. Transmission choices are limited to a five-speed manual or a four-speed overdrive automatic. The five-speed manual is standard equipment on all Sierra 1500s equipped with either the 4.3-liter V6 or 4.8-liter V8. The four-speed automatic that features a driver-selectable tow/haul mode for firmer shifts under load is optional with the 4.3-liter and 4.8-liter engines and the only choice on 5.3-liter-equipped Sierras.  Underneath, all Sierra 1500s utilize an independent suspension in front (coil springs on 2WD, torsion bars on 4WD) and a straight axle leaf spring setup in the rear. A notable change for this year is the switch to the Z85 firm-ride package as standard equipment on all half-ton Sierras. For a cushier ride, the Z83 soft ride suspension is still available. Or you can check the ZX3 option, which provides a dash-mounted switch that can alternate between both firm and soft suspension settings. With the proper equipment, a Sierra 1500 can tow up to 9,200 lbs. Like most full size trucks, the Sierra comes in a variety of configurations, including regular (two-door) or extended (four door) cabs, short (6.5-foot) or long (8-foot) beds, Wideside or Sportside box designs, and rear- or four-wheel-drive versions. A choice of three trim levels (SL, SLE or SLT) and a dizzying array of options and equipment packages are available to customize your truck exactly the way you want it.For the ultimate half-ton Sierra look no further than the Sierra Denali. Debuting as the C3 last year, the renamed Sierra Denali features a luxurious interior, sharply styled exterior, and exclusive hardware not available on any other GMC half-ton. The Sierra Denali gets the first application of GM's new Quadrasteer four-wheel steering system that shaves nearly ten feet off the Denali's turning circle as well as improving high-speed stability while towing a heavy trailer. A 6.0-liter, 325 horsepower V8 provides the power while a heavy-duty four-speed transmission and full-time all wheel drive put all the power to the ground. Heavy-duty ¾ ton brakes, a performance-tuned suspension and a standard towing package round out the Denali's impressive equipment list. Upgrades to the Denali's interior include six-way power heated bucket seats, an in-dash six-disc CD changer, steering wheel audio controls, a comprehensive trip computer, and two-tone leather upholstery.  All Sierras feature a roomy interior with ample storage space, straightforward controls, and a full complement of safety and convenience features. Rear seat accommodations in extended cab Sierras are surprisingly comfortable with easy access provided by clamshell-style rear doors on both the passenger and driver sides. All the available options and features are too numerous to list here, but needless to say, if you can't find it on a Sierra, it probably doesn't come on a full-size pickup.

Honda,honda civic,1998,honda civic 1998,,,4.6,"Select 1998 Honda Civic models get new wheel covers, a rear hatch handle and map lights. More than two decades ago, Honda introduced the Civic. It was a small, anonymous, unassuming car, competing in a market saturated by mammoth sedans sporting ornate chrome, garish styling treatments, and acres of sheetmetal. The producers of these defunct dinosaurs didn't bat an eye at Honda's fuel sipping entry, despite the fuel crisis of 1973. Big mistake.Since then, Americans have seen four generations of the Civic come and go, each much improved over the previous model, and each becoming immensely popular with consumers. 1996 brought us a new generation; certainly improved but not so much so that we'd consider it revolutionary. The 1998 Civic isn't much smaller than an Accord. Available in hatchback, sedan and coupe body styles, Honda has heeded customers who claimed the 1992-1995 Civic was too sporty looking. A grille was tacked on up front, sheetmetal contours provide a squarish profile, and larger rear taillamps give the Civic a more conservative look. Sedans, coupes, and hatchbacks have been given more individualistic styling themes, with the hatchback retaining honors as most odd among the trio.Dual airbags are part of the package, with antilock brakes standard on EX sedan and optional on EX coupe models. HX coupes carry through with an available continuously-variable transmission, making it the most exciting Civic offered. The Civic has few shortcomings, aside from its anonymous personality. Hondas tend to be on the expensive end of the scale when new, but over time, they are a far better value than most of their contemporaries. The Civic is no exception to the rule. It is a car for people who don't enjoy repair garage waiting rooms. It is a car that holds its resale value better than most of the cars it competes with. It is a car that easily endears itself to its owner.We think the Civic is a solid buy. For those who like a bit of spice in their commute, try the EX version of the coupe. Want a fuel miser? The HX coupe is your car. Strict budgets demand a look at the CX, while sedans are aimed more at the creature comfort side of the scale. Style-conscious buyers will go for the svelte coupe, or the suave EX sedan.

More standard equipment comes on the 2.5 Coupe and Sedan while the L model remains unchanged. The Outback Sport receives some exterior design changes. All Impreza models now come with 24-hour roadside assistance. Variety of body styles and AWD make the Impreza a nice alternative to other mainstream economy cars. The Impreza was originally built to battle the Ford Escorts, Toyota Corollas and Chevy Cavaliers that sold so well to young adults, but a zippy advertising campaign touting the underpowered Impreza as ""What to Drive"" alienated traditional Subie buyers and turned off the young adults it was supposed to attract. Sales of the Impreza were less than successful, and Subaru scrambled to find a solution. The first Subaru to wear an Outback badge was the Impreza Outback Sport wagon in 1994. The success of this model led to the Legacy-based Outback Wagon in 1995 and the mini-SUV-challenging Forester in 1998. Features unique to this version of the Impreza include a heavy-duty four-wheel independent suspension with 6.5 inches of ground clearance, 205/60 R15 M+S tires, splash guards, a two-tone paint scheme and a rear bumper step pad. The wagon has a small cargo area when the rear seat is raised, partially due to the steeply raked rear window. Drop the seat, though, and you've got 62 cubic feet to mess around with. Quibbles about the Outback Sport include a cramped rear seat and ugly plastic wheelcovers.For 2000, Subaru introduces the Impreza 2.5 RS Sedan, a vehicle that combines the performance and handling of the race rally-inspired 2.5 RS Coupe with the comfort and convenience of a four-door sedan. For a $100 base price increase, the 2.5 RS Coupe and Sedan receive more standard fare, including cruise control and viscous limited-slip rear differential.Overall, we find much to like about the Impreza. We've driven 2.5 RS, Outback and L Coupe models, and thoroughly enjoyed them. All Imprezas behave like street-legal rally cars, and they're a hoot to toss around. Fling one into a corner, and it clings to the pavement. Imprezas are a blast to drive hard and fast, and the all-wheel-drive system performs brilliantly on a variety of road surfaces. Each Impreza model is available with an $800 automatic transmission. Interiors are comfortable -- though the side glass feels a bit too close -- and steering and braking are communicative. There is one thing that bothers us about the Impreza lineup, and that's the lack of an antilock brake option on the L model. To get ABS, you must order the 2.5 RS. This doesn't make much sense coming from a company touting safety in its advertising. We'd also like Subaru to offer one of their turbocharged engines in the 2.5 RS. The company makes an amazing Japan-only performance car, based on the 2.5 RS, called the 22B. Alas, this twin-turbocharged monster is not available in the United States.Though prices haven't changed much for the millennium, we've always thought they were a bit on the high side to begin with. Despite the benefits of all-wheel drive, the budget-minded compact shopper must ask whether the price commanded by this Subaru is worth it.

Chevrolet,chevrolet blazer,2002,chevrolet blazer 2002,"['Wide range of features and options, competent drivetrain.']","['Spotty build quality, cheesy interior parts, uncomfortable rear seats.']",3.7,"Most new additions for 2002 involve cosmetic enhancements such as new exterior colors and optional sport stripes on the Xtreme model. LS models get a monotone paint scheme along with newly styled wheels. The ancient Blazer has effectively been replaced by the all-new, far superior TrailBazer ... and for good reason. Back in 1982, Chevrolet rolled out the S-10 Blazer, the first modern compact sport-utility vehicle. Two decades later, the Blazer remains a strong seller in one of the hottest automotive markets. The fact that it still offers a two-door bodystyle is one reason for its continued popularity. Chevrolet has scaled down the available trim levels this year, but the Blazer still offers just about every feature you would want in a basic, reasonably priced sport-ute. There are three basic models to choose from: two-door LS, four-door LS and two-door Xtreme. LS models offer either two- or four-wheel drive, while the Xtreme is available as a two-wheel drive only. LS models feature your standard complement of equipment and options. Cruise control, a tilt steering wheel, power windows and locks are all standard. Optional upgrades include a leather seating package, Bose stereo system and remote keyless entry. All Blazers feature the 4.3-liter Vortech V6 engine rated at 190 horsepower and 250 lb-ft of torque. LS-trim Blazers come standard with a four-speed automatic transmission, while the Xtreme model comes with a five-speed manual, with the four-speed an available option. Four-wheel disc brakes with ABS are standard on all models.  There are accommodations for as many as six passengers in the four-door Blazer, but we wouldn't recommend squeezing that many in for anything but a short trip. There's lots of cargo space, with the spare tire mounted underneath the cargo floor on four-door models. Chevy claims that with the rear seat folded, a washing machine box will fit into the cargo bay. Sadly, the Blazer's interior is marred by acres of chintzy plastic and precious little foot room in front of a rather low and mushy seat. Adult passengers won't find the rear accommodations much better. The Blazer offers a reasonably controlled ride on the pavement, although there's a little more body roll in the turns than we would like. The transmission shifts smoothly and the engine is strong off the line, but it runs out of breath in the higher ranges. All 4x4 models can be equipped with the AutoTrac push-button electronic transfer case. This four-wheel-drive system features an Auto mode that automatically engages four-wheel drive when it senses wheel slippage. This gives drivers the fuel economy of two-wheel drive and the safety of four-wheel drive without having to play with finicky shift levers. For those who don't need four-wheel drive and would prefer something a little sportier, check out the Blazer Xtreme. This two-door, two-wheel-drive-only model features a lowered sport-tuned suspension, deep-dish wheels with low-profile tires, extended lower body cladding, deep-tinted windows and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. A sunroof and upgraded stereos are also available to enhance the Xtreme's street machine image. If you're looking for a two-door midsize sport-ute, the Blazer and Ford's Explorer Sport are about the only games in town. With a starting price thousands less than the Ford, the Blazer is the obvious choice for value-conscious shoppers. Of course, that price lands you some low-quality interior materials and a somewhat dated design, but we would hardly call the Explorer Sport much of an improvement. If you plan on actually using your sport-utility as a utility vehicle, the Blazer would probably serve you well; but if you want all the refinement that modern SUVs offer, you'll have to pony up for one of the newer designs on the market.",V6 cylinder ,115,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Dodge,dodge challenger,2015,dodge challenger 2015,"['Strong V8 engines, topped by the new 707- Hellcat', 'supple, quiet ride', 'room for four adults', 'huge trunk.']","['Poor rearward visibility', 'beefy size dulls acceleration and handling.']",4.7,"For 2015, the Dodge Challenger gets a major overhaul. Headlining the act is the new SRT Hellcat, which gets a supercharged V8 engine good for a rather outlandish 707 . On all Challengers, you'll find new styling details, a revised and upgraded interior and a new eight-speed automatic transmission. The 2015 Dodge Challenger boasts a rare mix of talents, combining the power and attitude of a muscle car with the refinement of a luxury coupe. Paying homage to the past while still being fully up to date  is a pretty tough feat, yet the 2015 Dodge Challenger manages to do just that. This  retro-styled muscle car sports updated styling this year. That seeming oxymoron  means it has swapped out its previous 1970-style grille and taillights for  1971-inspired units that, to our eyes, work even better. Yet underneath those  classic lines the Challenger is completely modern with its keyless ignition,  infotainment system and eight-speed automatic transmission, the latter allowing  a big coupe with a near-500- V8 to earn a 25 mpg highway rating.
This year also brings a much-improved interior with higher-quality  materials, and that new infotainment system is the same highly regarded 8.4-inch  touchscreen interface used in most other Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep products. The Challenger's  base V6 engine carries over, but there's a new Challenger R/T ""Scat Pack""  edition, which provides the same 485- V8 as the SRT 392 but at a lower price  point. Rumbling in with the biggest stick of all is the new SRT Hellcat, which sends  a pavement-rippling 707  and 650 pound-feet of torque to the rear wheels via  a supercharged 6.2-liter V8.
Put one of these boffo V8 engines under the hood of just  about any car and you'd be guaranteed to have something that's a blast to drive.  But what really impresses us is the Challenger's measure of practicality.  Unlike its admittedly smaller Chevy and Ford rivals, the Challenger offers an  adult-friendly backseat, a large trunk and a quiet, comfortable ride that all  make this boulevard bruiser a fine daily driver and road tripper. True, the  2015 Dodge Challenger isn't quite as athletic when you're driving  enthusiastically around tight turns. The Chevrolet Camaro and Ford Mustang boast  sharper handling (particularly in their respective track-oriented Z/28 and  GT350 guises) and simply aren't as bulky. But they also have tight backseats  and firmer rides.
All three of these cars are very impressive. But it's the Challenger  that best represents the modern take on a classic American muscle car. It's got  the ability to do John Force-worthy burnouts, the most identifiable  heritage-based style, composed ride and handling and that big interior space  that's ideally suited for cruising this big country of ours. And, if that's  still not enough for you, there's the Hellcat, which allows you to brag to your  friends that you've got more ponies under the hood than a Lamborghini Aventador.  If you're shopping for a 2015 performance coupe,  the Challenger is a must-see. All 2015 Dodge Challengers are rear-wheel drive. The base  SXT is powered by a 3.6-liter V6 engine that produces 305  and 268 lb-ft of  torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard. EPA  fuel economy estimates stand at 23 mpg combined (19  city/30 highway).
The Challenger R/T gets a 5.7-liter V8 and a standard  six-speed manual transmission that harnesses 375  and 410 lb-ft. When hooked  up to the available eight-speed automatic, the V8's output drops slightly to  372  and 400 lb-ft. In Edmunds testing, a manual-equipped Challenger R/T went  from zero to 60 mph in 5.8 seconds. Although that's respectable, it's still about  a second slower than what you can expect from a V8-powered Camaro or Mustang. Fuel  economy is 19 mpg  combined (16/25) for the automatic and 18 mpg combined (15/23)  with the manual.
The Challenger R/T Scat Pack and SRT models get their  swagger from a 6.4-liter V8 that produces 485  and 475 lb-ft of torque. A  six-speed manual is standard and an eight-speed automatic is optional. In  Edmunds testing, a manual-equipped SRT 392 went from zero to 60 mph in 4.5  seconds, which is impressively quick, if still a bit off the pace of the top Camaro  or Mustang. SRT fuel economy estimates stand at 18 mpg combined (15/25) for the automatic and 17 mpg combined (14/23) for the manual.
The Challenger SRT Hellcat packs a 6.2-liter supercharged V8  that cranks out 707  and 650 lb-ft.  With only so much traction available from the 275-width rear tires (the Viper,  with less power, has 335-width rear tires), we got a 0-60 time of 4.1 seconds  with the automatic. More telling of this car's capability is the 11.9-second,  123.4-mph quarter-mile performance. The EPA says you'll get 16 mpg combined with either transmission. Every 2015 Dodge Challenger  comes standard with antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control,  active front head restraints, front side airbags and side curtain airbags. 
Rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, blind spot monitoring, rear  cross-traffic alerts and a forward collision  warning system are available. The added functionality of the 8.4-inch  Uconnect touchscreen potentially includes remote vehicle access, emergency  assistance and stolen vehicle locating.
In Edmunds brake testing, an  R/T came to a stop from 60 mph in 111 feet, a short distance, though that's  typical for a performance car with summer-rated tires. An SRT8 392 did even  better, at 106 feet, while a Hellcat was right there with 108 feet.
In government crash testing,  the Challenger received a top  five-star rating for overall crash protection, with four stars for total frontal-impact  safety and five stars for total side-impact safety. The Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety gave the Challenger its top safety score of  Good in the moderate-overlap front-impact and side-impact crash tests. The IIHS  gave the Challenger its second best score of Acceptable in roof strength and head restraint (whiplash protection)  tests. In the small-overlap front-impact test, the Challenger received the  second lowest rating of Marginal from the IIHS.  One of the 2015 Dodge Challenger's signature traits is its excellent  ride quality. You could take this big coupe on an all-day road trip and feel as  if you never left your sofa. The default suspension tuning of the base SXT is  pretty floaty, however. As such, we recommend springing at least for the SXT  Plus, as it includes firmer underpinnings. Otherwise, the Challenger actually handles  rather well. This is especially true of the higher-performance versions, which  provide a crisp, responsive and confident drive on a curvy road. Still, none of  them will let you forget about the car's sheer bulk, especially on narrow roads.  The Mustang and Camaro are more agile and less imposing around tighter turns.
The V6 model is obviously less thrilling than the V8s, but with 305  horses on tap, it can certainly hold its own. If you've got one of the V8s  under the hood, though, you'll be treated to a proper muscle car experience.  The standard R/T's 5.7-liter V8 accelerates smartly and makes lovely noises,  while the Scat Pack, SRT 392 and SRT Hellcat's gonzo V8s are off the charts in  both respects. Although the manual transmission is easy to operate, it does  have somewhat long throws and doesn't like to be rushed. As such, those who  plan on running quarters on Grudge night may want to consider the speedy  automatic gearbox, which snaps off much quicker shifts. This year's refresh has given the Challenger the stylish cabin it has  long deserved. A driver-centric theme is evident in the canted center console  and configurable central dash display. Automatic-transmission cars sport a  T-handle that recalls the selector used in the original 1970s Challenger. Moreover,  the small-diameter, well-contoured steering wheel makes for a pleasant  interface between car and driver. Overall materials quality is very good, and  the dash features handsome metallic accents. Another notable improvement is the  use of Dodge's superb 8.4-inch, multifunction  touchscreen. It features large virtual buttons, an intuitive layout and  fairly quick responses. Even the base 5-inch screen works pretty well.
The front seats in most Challengers are wide and flat, which doesn't  do much for lateral support, but they're comfy for long-distance drives. The sport  seats have better side bolstering and are also covered in leather and simulated  suede. The backseat is remarkably roomy for two adults, with good headroom and  decent legroom. It also features a 60/40-split-folding back, a fold-down  armrest and even a middle seat for tiny or exceptionally good-natured folks. The  trunk is also generously sized; at 16.2 cubic feet, the Challenger's cargo hold  is positively enormous for this segment, rivaling some large sedans for hauling  capacity.
Our chief complaint with the interior involves rearward visibility,  which is tough due to the Challenger's high beltline and chunky rear roof  pillars. However, the available rearview camera and parking sensors are a huge  help when maneuvering into a parking spot. 
The SXT starts with the V6 engine, 18-inch alloy wheels,  keyless entry and ignition, a 7-inch configurable dash display, Bluetooth phone  and audio connectivity, full power accessories, cruise control, auto-dimming  rearview mirror, automatic climate control, a tilt-and-telescoping  leather-wrapped steering wheel, a six-way power driver seat (with power lumbar  adjustment), a 60/40-split-folding rear seat, a trip computer, a 5-inch  touchscreen interface (Uconnect),  voice commands and a six-speaker sound system with a CD player and an auxiliary  audio jack.
The SXT Plus adds 20-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, performance  suspension and brakes, foglights, automatic headlights, rear parking sensors, a  rearview camera, leather upholstery, heated and ventilated front seats, a  heated steering wheel with power tilt-and-telescoping  adjustments, an 8.4-inch Uconnect touchscreen and an upgraded sound  system with satellite radio and an iPod/USB audio interface.
The Challenger R/T essentially starts with the SXT equipment  and adds the 5.7-liter V8 engine and 20-inch alloy wheels. Opt for the Challenger R/T Plus and you'll get  the same upgrades as the SXT Plus. 
Available for  the SXT Plus and R/T Plus is the R/T Classic package, which adds old-school dual R/T side stripes,  20-inch classic five-spoke wheels, xenon headlights and upgraded leather upholstery  with simulated suede inserts. Also optional on both the SXT and the R/T is the Super  Track Pak (not a typo), which features unique 20-inch black wheels; higher-performance suspension, steering  and brakes; and, for the SXT, the body-color  rear spoiler, rear parking sensors and a rearview camera.
The R/T Scat Pack trim starts with the R/T's features and  adds a more powerful V8, 20-inch wheels, an upgraded suspension, Brembo brakes,  active exhaust system, front and rear spoilers, performance-oriented stability  control programming, front sport seats, Bluetooth audio, a navigation system, an 8.4-inch  touchscreen and an upgraded sound system with satellite radio and an iPod/USB  audio interface.
Optional on the Scat Pack is the Leather Interior Group, which includes the upgraded leather/simulated  suede sport seats, heated and ventilated front seats and a heated steering  wheel with power tilt-and-telescoping adjustment. Also available is the Scat  Pack Appearance Group, which features different wheels, a gloss black grille,  xenon headlights and ""Bumble Bee"" rear stripes.
If you're into  the Challenger for nostalgia's sake, the R/T, R/T Plus and Scat Pack can all be  equipped with a ""Shaker"" hood, conical intake filter and Shaker exterior  graphics as well.
The Challenger SRT 392 starts with the Scat Pack with the  Leather Interior Group and adds a unique hood with center scoop, forged 20-inch  wheels, improved Brembo brakes, xenon headlights, adaptive suspension dampers,  adjustable driver modes and an 18-speaker Harman Kardon audio system.
At the top of this meaty food chain is the Challenger SRT  Hellcat, which starts with the features of the SRT 392 and adds a supercharged  V8, two key fobs that control engine output (black is reduced power, red is  full power), a unique hood with a center scoop and air extractors, black rocker  panels, larger front and rear spoilers, remote start, rear parking sensors, a  rearview camera, blind-spot/rear cross-path monitoring and the Harman  Kardon audio system.
Other  option packages (depending on trim level) include the Driver Convenience Group (power-folding mirrors, xenon headlights,  rear parking sensors, blind-spot/rear cross-path monitoring, remote start) and  the Technology Group (automatic wipers,  automatic high-beam headlight control, adaptive cruise control and forward  collision warning). Individual option highlights (depending on trim level) include  a sunroof, xenon headlights, the Harman Kardon audio system and a navigation  system (includes HD and satellite radio as well as smartphone app integration).

Gmc,gmc savana-cargo,2007,gmc savana-cargo 2007,"['Strong powertrains, dual side access doors, multiple wheelbase configurations, optional all-wheel drive.']","['Cheap interior plastics, stability control only available on 1-ton (3500) vans.']",3.8,"A flex-fuel, E85-capable version of the 5.3-liter V8 debuts for the 2007 GMC Savana Cargo van. The 2007 GMC Savana Cargo is pretty much the only game in town if you're looking for a traditional full-size van that doesn't look and drive as if it were designed two decades ago. Having been around for more than four decades, GMC's full-size van lived through the '70s, '80s and half of the '90s via sheet metal changes and updates to the running gear. Still, it rode on the same basic platform that it had had since the swinging '60s until a complete frame-up redesign took place in 1996. To celebrate the rebirth, the van's name was changed to ""Savana."" A new exterior look, new engines, extended body styles and improved ergonomics soon made the Savana hard to overlook when compared with Ford's dated Econoline. A number of important under-the-skin changes took place for 2003, including a wider selection of V8 engines, the first-time availability of all-wheel drive, upgraded brakes, a stronger frame and various interior improvements -- all of which went a long way toward making the Savana safer and more capable than ever before.As the variant meant almost exclusively for contractors and businesses, the 2007 GMC Savana Cargo provides immense cargo and payload capacities -- about 253 cubic feet and nearly 3,600 pounds, respectively, in the 3500 model. It also comes with less standard equipment than the already spartan passenger-van version of the Savana. This means that it's pretty inexpensive in stock condition but customers will likely want to consider some of the available optional features and job-specific packages to tailor the van for their needs. Given the Savana's superior driving dynamics and newer design, we usually recommend it over the aged Econoline. Those seeking an alternative to the traditional domestic vans might want to check out the Mercedes-Benz-designed Dodge Sprinter. The standard engine on rear-wheel-drive 1500 models is a 4.3-liter V6 rated at 195 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. A flexible-fuel 5.3-liter V8, with 295  and 335 lb-ft of torque, is standard on AWD 1500 and optional on two-wheel-drive 1500 series vans. Heavy-duty 2500 models come standard with a 4.8-liter V8 rated at 285  and 295 lb-ft of torque. A 6.0-liter V8 rated at 300  and 360 lb-ft of torque is standard on the 3500 and optional on the 2500. Also available on 2500 and 3500 series vans is a 6.6-liter turbodiesel V8 with 250  and 460 lb-ft of torque. All 1500s use a four-speed automatic transmission, while 2500 and 3500 series vans get a heavy-duty version. Trailer towing capacities range from 5,900 to a stout 10,000 pounds, depending on the model. Antilock disc brakes are standard on all models. Light-duty models (GVWR less than 8,600 pounds) feature a front-passenger-sensing system that will deactivate the front airbag if it senses a small adult or child sitting up front. Heavy-duty models use a manual airbag-deactivation switch for the front passenger. A stout frame and rack-and-pinion steering (half-ton models only) give the 2007 GMC Savana Cargo a leg up on the Ford Econoline when it comes to ride and handling. Although the Savana is still far from nimble, its modern running gear makes day-to-day driving a much more enjoyable experience. The brakes require less effort than those of the Econoline, and the powerful engines really make a difference when it comes to merging and passing when the van is loaded up. The interior is built for functionality and not much else. The controls are simple to use and well within reach of the driver. A number of job-specific interior configurations can be ordered to tailor the van's cargo area to one's business. The 2007 GMC Savana Cargo (GMC also refers to it as the ""Work Van"") is a full-size van meant primarily for commercial users. The standard wheelbase (135-inch) Savana comes in half-ton (1500), 3/4-ton (2500) and 1-ton (3500) configurations, while the extended-wheelbase version (155-inch) is available on the 2500 and 3500 series vans only. Standard equipment on the Savana Cargo includes air-conditioning and a theft-deterrent system but not much else. Option choices include swing-out passenger-side access doors, a sliding passenger-side door, a rear air-conditioner and heater, power windows and door locks, cloth upholstery, cruise control, a tilt steering wheel, keyless entry and a CD stereo. GMC is also able to outfit the Savana for job-specific cargo configurations.",V6 cylinder ,73,,rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Lexus,lexus rx-350l,2021,,"['Impeccable cabin finished with top-quality materials', 'Advanced safety features come standard', 'Excellent ride and seat comfort']","['Third-row space is tight for anyone other than small kids', 'Toucad controller is distracting to use', 'Less overall cargo capacity than competitors', 'Hard to see out of']",4,"The  2021 Lexus RX 350L is a midsize crossover identical to the RX 350 except for  one key differentiator: The RX 350L has a stretched wheelbase and adds a third  row of seating. That means it has many of the RX 350's strengths —  namely, that model's penchant for passenger and ride comfort. It also offers  surprisingly nimble handling for such a big vehicle, and it's especially  shocking since this elongated version isn't available with the RX 350's  performance-minded F Sport package. Once you consider its relatively low cost  for the class, the RX 350L makes a lot of sense on paper.  
But  the Lexus RX 350L doesn't make the most of its extended wheelbase. Many  purpose-built three-row competitors have a more spacious back seat, and there's  little cargo room behind the RX's third row. And, like with the standard RX  350, you have to spec the L just right. If you don't opt for the Navigation  package, for instance, you'll be stuck with a small central display without  touchscreen capability. You'll instead have to use a trackpad controller, and  this combination makes for one of our least favorite infotainment systems on  the market. Though pricier, the RX's rivals generally do not ask you to  compromise this much or pay such close attention to the options list. The  RX 350L comes pretty well loaded out of the gate, so we don't think you have to  go wild on the options. The most significant stand-alone options require the  addition of the Premium package, but  from there you can add worthy and relatively inexpensive features such as  heated and ventilated front seats. The Navigation  package is also worth checking out since it includes an eye-popping central  display with touchscreen capability — something the standard display  lacks. If you opt for the Navigation package, spend a little extra and get the  Mark Levinson hi-fi audio system. Your ears will thank you. How does the RX 350L drive? The RX 350L feels good on the road, with solid pickup, easy steering, smooth stops and competent handling. Our instrumented test numbers tell their own story, though, and the RX trails many of its competitors by at least a small margin in acceleration, braking performance and handling grip. 

   While we can overlook the numbers, we noticed an occasional delay between asking for power and the transmission response. This phenomenon is a bit inconsistent, but it could be the biggest annoyance day to day if it becomes a common occurrence. How comfortable is the RX 350L? Comfort is where the RX excels, but only for those seated in the first two rows. The front seats are wide and accommodating, with a contoured back that benefits from four-way lumbar adjustment. The second-row seats are pretty comfy as long you don't have to make sacrifices for anyone sitting in the tiny third row.

   The RX 350L's suspension takes the edges off all bumps around town, even the big ones. The cabin is also well insulated from traffic and wind noise. You won't have to raise your voice to have a conversation. The one oddity is the rear-seating climate control panel that's located on one side of the third row of seats. How’s the interior? The interior feels luxurious and roomy if you leave the third-row seats stowed. Raise the third row, however, and things go south. The third row is very cramped, and room in the second row can suffer because you'll likely have to slide the seats up to use the third row. It's a poor showing in the three-row segment. Visibility can be an issue in parking lot scenarios, and you could be playing a guessing game without the optional 360-degree camera.

   We appreciate the number of clearly labeled buttons around the cabin. You still have to use the infotainment a fair amount to access certain controls, but Lexus has improved it this year, replacing the old joystick-style controller with a toucad and adding a touchscreen interface. The location of the touchscreen makes it a bit of a reach for anyone, but it's better than not having that functionality. How’s the tech? Lexus' Mark Levinson stereos are always a high point, and the big infotainment screen is crisp and appealing. Lexus' Enform app has a handful of useful features, but it only integrates a limited selection of third-party apps. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration operates fine for the most part, though some of our Android users experienced issues with some apps missing and sometimes had no functionality at all. Charging options are available for the first two rows, with a generous six USBs total.

   The driver aids mostly work well, especially adaptive cruise, which will operate in stop-and-go traffic. Most other systems are similarly strong, but the lane keeping assist offers very little intervention and can lose sight of lane markers. How’s the storage? For the size gained in its growth spurt, the L version of the RX reaps few benefits in utility. The biggest gains come with the third row folded, netting a total of 23 cubic feet of cargo space, but in all configurations the Lexus falls far short of three-row competitors. It does much better on small-item storage. There are clever little cubbies for the driver and front passenger, with plenty of options for not just storing but also organizing your stuff.

   The child safety seat anchors in the second row are easily accessible, but you might have trouble fitting bulkier rear-facing car seats if you have the second row forward to allow for use of the third. And if you plan to do any towing, 3,500 pounds is the limit. It's far from a class-leading figure, but it's more than enough for light towing. How’s the fuel economy? We tested the front-wheel-drive RX 350L, which gets an EPA-estimated 22 mpg (19 city/26 highway). That's marginally better than average for a three-row crossover SUV. All-wheel-drive RX 350Ls take a 1 mpg hit across the board but still do better than average. Our test RX 350L fell a bit short on our 115-mile real-world evaluation route, averaging 21.6 mpg. Is the RX 350L a good value? The RX feels solidly put together, and though there are hard plastics around, you're unlikely to interact with them. Touch points are covered with high-quality materials that really lend a luxury feel. Lexus put some thought into this interior.

   Dollar for dollar, the RX 350L is priced pretty competitively in the segment, but the idea of paying a premium for little extra usability over the regular RX is a bit galling. You're better off spending your money elsewhere since most midsize three-row competitors are quicker, roomier and more useful. Lexus has taken a stylish and intriguing two-row midsize SUV and turned it into a three-row also-ran. It comes up short in a segment of strong contenders offering more performance, fun and practicality.

Every vehicle in the 5 Series lineup is a wonderful car. If you can afford to buy one, we recommend that you do. Sure, there are other great cars out there in this price range; we just think this is one of the best. BMWs are famous for the suppleness of their ride and the responsiveness of their steering; ""firmness without harshness"" is the phrase most often bandied about our offices when discussing these cars' uncanny ability to stay connected to the road while communicating almost telepathically with the driver. The 5 Series is no exception. Available in two flavors, 528i or 540i, drivers can choose a sedan or a sport-wagon body style. 528i models are powered by a 2.8-liter inline 6-cylinder engine that provides excellent midrange torque and makes 193 horsepower. The 528i comes with a standard five-speed manual transmission, or can be optioned with a five-speed Steptronic automanual transmission. Under the hoods of the 540i sedans and sport wagons sit 4.4-liter, 32-valve V8s that offer zero-to-60 times in the low sixes, make 282 horsepower and can also be mated to five-speed Steptronic automanual transmissions, if desired. The 540i sedan continues to be available with a six-speed manual transmission. If you love to drive, opt for this model and prepare yourself for an invigorating ride. The suspension is pleasantly firm on this lively model, but it is difficult to operate the transmission smoothly. As one would expect in a top-end, luxury/sport vehicle, equipment levels are first rate. Standard fare includes rear self-leveling suspension, car and key programmable memory, dual zone air conditioning and cruise control with steering wheel controls. All-Season Traction (AST), Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) and Dynamic Brake Control are standard on all 2000 5-Series cars. Rain-sensing windshield wipers and Xenon headlights are standard on 540 models and optional on the 528s this year. Standard safety equipment includes 9-mph bumpers, dual airbags, door-mounted side-impact airbags, and a front head-protection system. Three-point seatbelts at all seating positions, impact sensors that unlock the doors and activate the hazard lights in the event of a serious accident, remote keyless entry, two-step unlocking, coded drive-away protection, and a vehicle security system are also standard. Rear-passenger side-impact airbags are optional. To list all of the 5 Series' luxury features would take more space than we have. A few of the more noticeable ones are dual automatic climate controls, power moonroof, 200-watt stereo, 10-way power front seats with power headrests, heated steering wheel, and a right-hand outside mirror that tilts down when the car is in reverse to help drivers see curbs when parallel parking. Yes indeed, the 5 Series is a wonderful car. Given all of the inquiries we receive about it, you apparently think so, too. If you can afford to buy one, we recommend that you do.

The 2001 BMW M5 is the king of all performance sedans, a classic for the ages. BMW went and did it. After constantly improving the current 5 Series platform until it was one of the best sport sedans on the planet, they've taken the segment to an entirely new level with the radical M5. If you're already a fan of the 540i, prepare to be mesmerized by Bavaria's top performance sedan.Starting with the 4.4-liter block from the 540i, BMW's M Division bumped displacement to 5.0 liters with a bore and stroke job. Compression is set at 11:1 (requiring the use of premium fuel, of course) and the cylinder heads are redesigned to offer greater crossflow cooling. Outfitted with the requisite double-VANOS variable valve-timing system, this engine is good for 394 horsepower. Even with the M5's 3,800-pound curb weight, zero-to-60 acceleration happens in a lightning-quick 5 seconds! But don't expect those times to happen with both hands on the wheel; the M5's only transmission is a six-speed manual.Along with Corvette-like acceleration, the sedan features a lower ride height than you'll see on a standard 540i, aluminum suspension pieces, stiffer spring and shock rates, and 18-inch wheels with Z-rated tires. A sport mode switch on the center console will recalibrate the variable-assist power steering for increased road feel and snappier throttle response. When things get too snappy, traction control and electronic stability control are waiting to intervene (unless you've switched them off).While paying 70 large for a performance toy might not sit well with the other half, don't forget to mention all the amenities that come standard on every M5 Sedan. Dual-zone climate control, heated leather seats with leather inserts and eight-way power adjustments, power headrests, a GPS navigation system, a 10-speaker sound system, one-touch power windows, rain-sensing wipers, etc., etc. Remember, you're not just buying a European hot rod, this car is meant for safe and secure family transportation...right?You can customize the interior look of your M5 with a slew of no-cost options. Prefer the Nappa Heritage leather to the Nappa Point leather or the bruyere Wood Trim to the burl Wood Trim? Just check the option boxes that appeal to you. You can even delete the rear spoiler to further hide your M5's true intentions. Park Distance Control, a rear sunshade and a rear-seat pass-thru are the only extra-cost factory options, though a BMW CD changer is pre-wired and can be dealer installed for a nominal fee.The M5 represents BMW's most capable performance car yet. It is an uncompromising sport sedan in terms of both ability and amenity. If your demands for horsepower, handling, hedonism and hip-room run to the extreme, the M5 has no peer.",V8 cylinder ,150,,rear wheel drive , 6-speed manual

The hybrid version,  the LS 500h, has the added benefit of increased fuel efficiency. Sturdy build  quality and high-quality materials also continue to make the LS a notable  alternative to traditional European luxury sedan rivals. 
The  2021 LS 500h gets minor style and suspension updates, the latter intended to  reduce body roll and tighten up turns and cornering. Lexus also retuned the  hybrid power system to deliver more electric power during acceleration and give  the LS a quicker kick. There are new trim elements around the cabin and more  cushioned toucoints (softer armrests, for example). 
Among the more significant updates is  the availability of Android Auto, allowing Android users to finally control  their smartphone apps, music and messaging through the LS infotainment system.  But among the LS 500h's few flaws — it's not terribly exciting to  drive and not significantly more fuel-efficient than the regular LS —  is that same infotainment system. It uses a clumsy mouse/trackpad-style  interface and remains an exercise in patience and frustration. 
The Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, Porsche  Panamera and Mercedes-Benz S-Class (a full redesign of the latter arrives for  2022) are among today's best large luxury sedans, and nearly all of them offer  a hybrid powertrain. Overall, we don't think the LS 500h stands out enough in  this group to make it a fully compelling pick unless you're particularly  smitten with Lexus' traditional virtues of quality and comfort. Really, this flagship luxury sedan  comes with every standard feature you could want. But if by chance the 16-way  power-adjustable front seats aren't comfortable enough, you can upgrade to  seats with 28-way adjustment and massage function.

XLT models get privacy glass as standard equipment, while the upscale Eddie Bauer trim level now comes with HomeLink and a class IV trailer towing package (4x4 models only). Eddie Bauers also get second-row leather captain's chairs and a rear-seat entertainment system as optional equipment. A new ""No Boundaries"" option package includes a monochromatic black exterior, side body cladding, 17-inch wheels, illuminated running boards and special front seats. One major flaw, namely twitchy steering, turns us off the Expedition. Twitchy steering is not something you want in a tall 5,000-pound vehicle. Which one do you think Goldilocks would pick? With the new Escape on the breakfast table for 2001, it seems Ford has enough different-sized SUVs to satisfy everyone. And for those people who want something bigger than an Explorer, but smaller than an Excursion, the Expedition should be just right. After allowing GM to dominate the full-size SUV arena for years, in 1997 Ford introduced the Expedition, which had its sights squarely aimed at the Chevy Tahoe and GMC Yukon. Able to seat nine people with its optional third-row bench seat, Expedition is also easier to park and maneuver than the larger Chevy Suburban (or Excursion, for that matter). The vehicle has good payload and towing capacity: 2,000 pounds and 8,000 pounds, respectively. New standard features on the XLT include privacy glass, heated mirrors and a class IV trailer tow package. The Eddie Bauer edition gets a HomeLink navigation system as well as the trailer tow package. Power-adjustable pedals are standard on all trim levels and allow drivers of smaller stature to move the pedals toward their feet rather than moving the seat uncomfortably close to the steering wheel. Interior coddling can be increased on the Eddie Bauer edition with the optional VHS rear-seat entertainment system.On the road the Expedition is well mannered. It's obviously not a car, but compared to the old Ford Bronco, the Expedition rides like a limousine. Expedition buyers can order the vehicle with two single third-row seats instead of the standard 60/40-split bench seat for 2001. Like the second-row bench seating, the two individual seats can be stowed if extra cargo-carrying capacity is required. Ford has put a lot of time and money into making this truck a sales leader in their already dominant light-truck lineup. The Expedition comes standard with dual airbags, antilock brakes, while side airbags are optional. Our biggest gripe stems from the powertrain. While Ford has boosted output for both the 4.6- and 5.4-liter engines, they still can seem less powerful when compared to the Vortec powerplants found in GM's full-size trucks. One option that we think everyone should investigate is the lighted running boards. The Expedition towers above the ground, and entering and exiting this truck will take its toll on most passengers after a few days The Ford Expedition is a nice balance between comfort and function, and its ability to seat nine people makes it popular with large families and those who have to haul stuff around. Nevertheless, we can't overlook the surprisingly roomy Dodge Durango and the outstanding Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon when discussing big trucks.

Other big news is the availability of the optional 5.2-liter V8 engine in 2WD models, and a six-cylinder that qualifies the JGC as a transitional low emission vehicle (TLEV) in California.  Refinements have been made to the ABS system, entry-level cassette stereo and floor carpet fit.  In January, a sporty TSi model debuted with monotone paint, special aluminum wheels and other goodies. For years, the Ford Explorer has been the best-selling sport-utility vehicle in this country, but in 1993 a new challenger called Grand Cherokee arrived to try to wrest the sales crown away from the champ.  It was not successful.  However, it did outsell every other sport utility on the market, and became the Explorer's biggest threat.Indeed, this Jeep has the most car-like feel of sport utilities, and is among the most stable on pavement.  In fact, with the optional 5.2-liter V8 pumping away under the hood, the Grand Cherokee becomes the Porsche of sport-utes.  Equipped with a dual airbag system and four-wheel antilock disc brakes, Grand Cherokee buyers have long list of equipment to wade through, including three different drive systems (2WD, part-time 4WD, full-time 4WD), four different trim levels (Laredo, TSi, Limited, Orvis), and a host of luxury and convenience items.The exterior is all hard edges and angles, but is instantly recognizable as a Jeep product and looks rugged.  A retro touch we could do without is the location of the spare tire.  The Grand Cherokee doesn't have tiny tires, and the cargo area is among the smallest in the class to begin with, so why is the tire in the cargo area?  It should be under the cargo floor, mounted under the truck or placed on a rack on the liftgate.  Otherwise, we have few quibbles with this sport ute.Jeep improved the Grand Cherokee for 1997.  Mechanical changes are limited to the availability of the optional 5.2-liter V8 on 2WD models, and a revised 4.0-liter inline six that allows the JGC to qualify as a Transitional Low Emissions Vehicle in California.  According to Jeep, the anti-lock brake system has been refined this year.Inside, Jeep modified the tilt steering column, extended the rear seat heating ducts, and improved the fit and appearance of the floor carpeting.  The entry-level cassette stereo has been upgraded as well.  Outside, Jeep adds three new exterior colors, and all Grand Cherokees have a full-body anti-chip coat of primer under the paint.  As you can see, Jeep isn't resting on its laurels waiting for the competition to leave the Grand Cherokee in the dust.In January, the TSi model debuted, sporting specific alloy wheels, monotone paint in a choice of three shades, dark blue pinstriping, leather seats, high powered audio system, and more luxurious interior trimmings.Unfortunately, just as Jeep caught up to and surpassed the Explorer in comfort and safety features last year, Ford went and squeezed a V8 under the Explorer's hood.  This year, Ford is offering a new overhead cam V6 engine in the Explorer which puts out 20 more horsepower than the Jeep inline six.  The Ford also has more room, a more comfy rear seat, and a lower price tag.  Plus, you don't have to load cargo around a big ol' tire in the back.  The verdict?  For around town family hauling, we prefer the value-packed Explorer XLT.

You can  even order your Encore with remote engine start and a heated steering wheel. 
True  to form, though, the Encore doesn't have a whole lot of space for cargo. The  back seat also isn't particularly roomy, and average-size adults will begin to  feel cozy fairly quickly once the doors are closed. Also, the Encore isn't much  fun to drive, partially because its singular engine choice is underpowered.  Buick used to offer an optional upgraded engine with more power, but it's no  longer available for 2020.

The hard- or soft top is available in Dark Tan, and new colors decorate both the exterior and the interior. The Wrangler is the off-road icon.  Originally built for military use, the original Jeep has retained its Spartan utility while slowly evolving into a practical means of transportation.  The Wrangler is still the drive-me-hard-through-the-slop beast of yesterday, with a few appreciated improvements for the daily commute.Jeep Wranglers have long been the standard for those valiant explorers who truly wish to go where no one has gone before.  The go-anywhere ability of the Wrangler has been improved by the Quadra-Coil suspension which allows an additional seven inches of articulation over the old leaf spring set-up; thus resulting in increased approach and departure angles.  The Quadra-Coil suspension, along with improved shocks and tires, also greatly improve the Wrangler's on-road manners. Available in SE, Sport and Sahara trim levels, the Wrangler fits into several budgets.  Our favorite model is the Sport, which comes with the powerful 4.0-liter engine yet retains no-nonsense utility; nicely equipped, the Sport comes in at under $20,000.  The SE is for people who don't mind a lack of power or available ABS, and the Sahara is for anyone who can't live without leather and a quality sound system.  Nobody, however, will mistake this vehicle for a smooth-running family sedan; the Wrangler is very much a truck thanks to its high step-in height and abundant wind and road noise.  A five-speed manual transmission remains standard and a three-speed automatic is available for those who don't plan on any serious off-roading. For 1999, Jeep has decided to give the Wrangler some additional user-friendliness by tossing out the sliding heater controls and replacing them with twist knobs.  A revised frame makes the Wrangler 16 lbs. lighter than before, and a passenger-side airbag cutoff switch, introduced in May of 1998, continues to offer value for anyone who must tote children up front.Over the past few years, Jeep has done a great job improving the Wrangler.  Gone are some of the nagging complaints we had about safety, wind noise and engine roar; what remains is a solid truck with hard-core capabilities and rugged good looks.

And in many cases, some people just simply want a larger and more powerful truck to drive around.  The 2022 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD's towing capacity maxes out at around 18,500 pounds when properly equipped, and it can carry close to 4,0000 pounds of cargo in its bed with the right configuration. These impressive numbers are in part thanks to the truck's powerful gasoline and turbodiesel engines. Chevy also offers the 2500HD in regular-, double- and crew-cab body styles, plus standard or long bed lengths, to further suit your particular needs.

The Silverado can also be equipped with eight cameras that provide 15 parking, driving and hitch viewpoints. Updates for the 2022 model year are minimal, but Chevrolet did make the handy Multi-Flex tailgate available on all trim levels. The Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD provides the power and capability you'd expect from a heavy-duty truck and a roomy and comfortable cabin. One of the truck's main drawbacks, though, is its interior.

If you're looking for flexibility, capability, and a ""professional grade"" image, look no further than GMC's 2500 Sierra.  Available in either light-duty or completely redesigned heavy-duty versions, these versatile trucks come in a variety of configurations and trim levels to suit just about anybody's pickup truck needs.Like the 1500 Series, these trucks share platforms and componentry with Chevrolet's Silverado, but Sierra gets some styling and feature enhancements to position GMC as the ""professional grade"" truck. Looks and special content aside, the biggest draw for GMC's big pickups are their exceptional powertrains, outstanding payload capacity, and unparalleled towing and hauling ability.At the heart of the heavy-duty Sierra's redesign this year is the availability of two new engines and transmissions.  The Duramax 6600 is an all-new turbodiesel V8 developed jointly with Isuzu that cranks out 300 horsepower and a whopping 520 foot-pounds of torque. (That's 65 horses and 20 foot-pounds more than Ford's PowerStroke, and 55/15 over the Dodge Cummins diesels.) When it comes to gasoline power, GM leads the pack there, too. The all-new Vortec 8100 V8 puts out 340 horsepower and 455 foot-pounds of torque - both numbers eclipsing those of the V10s being offered by competitors. Even the base Vortec 6000 V8, available in both light- and heavy-duty versions, has been juiced to 300 horses.Heavy-duty models offer an electronically controlled Allison automatic transmission that boasts a patented ""grade-braking"" feature that automatically finds the optimum gear to supply downhill engine braking without manually downshifting, allowing you to concentrate on the road. It also touts ""shift stabilization"" to prevent ill-timed upshifts and downshifts, and even has bolt-on ""Power Take Off"" capability that allows owners to run PTO-driven equipment on-site, delivering 250 foot-pounds of continuous torque.With comfy seats and plenty of the latest features, the redesigned heavy-duty Sierras sport roomier cabins with increased head, leg, and hip room over their predecessors. Light-duty 2500s carry over interiors from last year with child safety-seat tether hooks constituting the only new feature for 2001. While we're not sure if the evolutionary styling of the GM's heavy-duty pickups carry the brute appeal of a Ford Super Duty or the big-nosed 3500-series Dodge, we do know that they will beat them when it comes to good ol' pullin' and haulin.' Even if you decide to stick with the somewhat more tame light-duty version, the 2500 Sierra still provides all the power and capability you'll ever need along with a comfortable interior and a smooth ride.",V8 cylinder ,177,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Offering a  delightful driving experience that speaks the language of sophistication and  style, the TTS is the flip side of performance-focused rivals like the BMW M240i and Toyota GR  Supra.  
That  said, the 288-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers  ample thrills for those who prefer the price tag to the more powerful TT RS.  With 280 lb-ft of torque on tap, the TTS is a nice power upgrade from the base  TT, which tops out at 228 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque. A snappy  seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission is the only option for the TTS  (sorry, manual fans) and all-wheel drive is standard. The sporty little TTS  promises nimble handling and plenty of  acceleration as a side dish to its upscale interior and attractive silhouette,  much like the competitive Lexus RC 350 coupe. What we like about the charming  TTS is its all-around appeal.  The 2022 TTS coupe is available in just one well-equipped trim. Niceties like leather upholstery and a premium sound system are standard, and the TTS is replete with technology.

We knew a styling update would be in the picture for the 2023 BMW 3  Series and feared the beaver-toothed grille from the 4 Series and M3/M4 would  transition to the mild-mannered luxury sedan, too. Thankfully, BMW hasn't  fussed with the exterior too much — the grille is slightly wider than  before, the headlight cluster no longer has the little notch in the middle, and  the front and rear bumpers feature sharper angles, giving it a more modern  look. 
There  are significant changes to the interior, however. For starters, the 12.3-inch  digital instrument panel and central touchscreen now share a singular curved  housing running BMW's latest iDrive 8 software. The new software makes the BMW  Intelligent Personal Assistant smarter, with improved natural language voice  recognition and additional features, including the ability to open and close  the windows or the sunroof through verbal commands. Finally, the central screen  is upgraded to measure 14.9 inches — nearly double the size of the  previously standard 8.8-inch screen — and once again offers touch  functionality. 
BMW  has also streamlined the center stack control layout. There are almost zero  dedicated physical controls for the climate system. Instead, these functions  are moved to the touchscreen in a climate menu, though the driver and passenger  temperatures are always displayed. We're not huge fans of making  attention-sapping touchscreens even more convoluted, but at least you can use  the car's voice recognition system to change the temperature. The useful set of  eight preset buttons, which can be configured for anything from radio stations  to navigation destinations and specific menus, also disappears. Lastly, the  shift lever has been replaced by a toggle switch. 
All  these changes make for a compelling entrant into the compact luxury sedan  segment, but the 3 Series will face stiff competition from the redesigned  Mercedes-Benz C-Class, the stylish Audi A4 and the up-and-coming Genesis G70.  Read on for our thoughts on how the updated 3 Series fares. If  you have a spot to plug it in, the BMW 330e is our recommendation. It's price isn't much higher than the base 3 Series, yet  it comes equipped with a plug-in hybrid powertrain supplying an estimated 23  miles of pure electric driving before switching to gas-electric hybrid  operation. And models manufactured in North America may qualify for a federal tax credit and potentially other incentives  (for new-car buyers); these incentives could actually make it the least  expensive 3 Series.",Inline 4 cylinder ,138,,rear wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic 
Chevrolet,chevrolet suburban,1998,chevrolet suburban 1998,['Huge interior with seating for up to 9 passengers.  Fun to drive.  Great V-8 engine.'],['Ride on pavement is unrefined.  All the good stuff is optional.'],4.1,"New colors, a standard theft-deterrent system, optional heated seats, second-generation airbags and an automatic 4WD system improve the 1998 Suburban. In some sections of the country, wise middle-class folks have been tooling around for several years in mile-long Suburbans, whether or not they have great need for all that expanse behind the driver's seat.  These days, throughout the suburban reaches of Houston and Dallas, among other spots, the Chevrolet and GMC Suburban have become de facto status-flaunting vehicles, pushing prices beyond the reach of the common man.Yes, those who formerly wheeled about town in a Cadillac or Lincoln or Mercedes, and wouldn't feel quite right in a pickup truck, appear to have twirled their affections toward the biggest passenger vehicles in the General Motors repertoire.  Chevrolet, in fact, considers the Suburban ""as suited to the country club as to a roughneck oil field.""Mechanically, you get the same layout in the smaller Chevrolet Tahoe, but that vehicle is only available with Chevy's Vortec 5700 V8 engine.  Select a Suburban and you can accept that motor, with 255 horsepower.  Or, with the 3/4-ton C/K 2500 series you can go all the way, opting for the mammoth Vortec 7400 V8, whipping out 290 strutting horses and a mean 410 pound-feet of ground-tromping torque.  Oh, there's also an optional turbo-diesel.  Both the half- and 3/4-ton versions come with either two- or four-wheel drive, and all have four-wheel antilock braking.This season brings a new optional four-wheel drive system.  Called Autotrac, it automatically shifts from 2WD to 4WD when wheel slippage is detected, just like Ford's Control-Trac system in the similarly gargantuan Expedition.  Also new is an Enhancement Package, which adds heated front seats, heated exterior mirrors, carpeted floor mats, a reversible rear cargo mat, an electrochromic rearview mirror with integrated compass and exterior temperature readout, a Homelink programmable three-channel transmitter, and 46mm Bilstein shocks.  New colors are available for 1998, and a theft deterrent system is standard this year.Suburbans can seat up to nine occupants and tow as much as five tons, when properly equipped.  For families that need plenty of room for youngsters, or for retirees who need loads of power to haul a travel trailer, a Suburban can make good sense.  Chevrolet is combating competition from Ford's new Expedition, but for heavy-duty use and maximum space, Chevrolet and GMC are still the only serious games in town for a mammoth ""truck wagon.""",V8 cylinder ,92,,four wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Sahara and Sport models receive upgrades, including hard doors with roll-up windows. New optional wheels, increased output from the climate control system and an improved premium sound system round out the changes to the tough and ready 2002 Jeep Wrangler. The 2002 Jeep Wrangler has a stiff ride, offers about the same noise isolation as a motorcycle and has a soft top that's a nail-buster to operate. That said, the Wrangler also offers a visceral motoring experience like no other and the off-road ability of a mountain goat. The Wrangler continues to be the quintessential off-road icon. This Jeep began as a vehicle for military use and has retained its no-nonsense utility while slowly evolving into a practical and popular means of transportation. The Wrangler has never lost its drive-me-hard-through-the-slop attitude, despite improvements for enjoyable daily commuting. And it's one of the cheapest convertibles around. Available in SE, Sport, Sahara and new X trim levels, the Wrangler fits into several budgets.The SE is the lowest-priced Wrangler, but feels it with a distinct lack of power (a 2.5-liter inline four with only 120 horsepower is all she wrote at this level) or ABS. The Sahara is the priciest of the bunch and comes loaded with the 190-horsepower 4.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine, air conditioning, leather-wrapped steering wheel, front and rear tow hooks, fog lamps, AM/FM/CD stereo, Convenience Group (with lockable storage, and dual cupholders) and alloy wheels. Newly standard for the Sahara are meaty 30-inch (outside diameter) tires, full doors with roll-up windows and speed control (though we don't imagine a Wrangler as an ideal long-distance cruiser).  In between the SE and Sahara are the X and Sport models. The X fills the previous (and huge) price gap between the bare-bones SE and the more powerful and well-equipped Sport. Fitted with the muscular inline six and cloth seating, the X gives the essentials to those folks who can afford more than the SE but can't make the more than $4,000 jump to the Sport. Those who do choose a Sport will enjoy this year's upgrades that include the full doors with real windows, fog lamps and tow hooks front and rear. Nobody, however, will mistake the Wrangler for a smooth-running family sedan; it's very much a truck, thanks to its high step-in height, slow steering ratio and abundant wind and road noise. On the street, its petite size and tight turning radius make it a blast to maneuver, but it can get a little scary to drive and control at freeway speeds in severely high winds. Its performance off-road is unparalleled. The Wrangler's Quadra-Coil suspension allows for an incredible amount of wheel articulation as well as steep approach and departure angles. And the abundance of aftermarket parts to modify the Wrangler makes it enormously popular with the rock-crawling crowd. The Wrangler does have its quirks -- rear visibility can be a challenge and taking off and putting on the soft top requires superhuman levels of patience. Once the top is on, be prepared for obtrusive flapping. Ordering the Sahara with the Dual Top Group option gets you a hardtop with tinted glass and a folding/removable soft top for a multitude of configurations -- though transitioning from one to another can be a daunting task. Despite the top's packaging flaws and Wrangler's raw-edged nature, this Jeep is fun to drive, cheap to buy and terrific in its element.",Inline 4 cylinder ,115,,four wheel drive , 5-speed manual

There are some good midsize SUVs available. This is not one of them. The Honda Passport has been quietly going about its business for the past eight years. While the bulk of attention in the mid-sized sport-ute segment is directed toward the Ford Explorer, Toyota 4Runner, Dodge Durango and Nissan Pathfinder, the Passport has evolved to offer a combination of power, space and versatility that, if not compelling, at least comes in an attractive wrapper.The Passport first arrived in 1993 as a re-badged Isuzu Rodeo, an arrangement that allowed Honda to get in on the hot SUV craze without engineering its own truck. In 1998, the Passport was completely redesigned. Still built by Isuzu in its Lafayette, Ind., plant, the Honda got bigger inside, more comfortable and more powerful. The standard 205-horsepower 3.2-liter V6 makes 214 pound-feet of torque at a relatively low 3,000 rpm, providing enough get-up-and-go to satisfy most weekend warriors. But with no optional V8 engine available, the Passport compares poorly to other models in this class. Even the Pathfinder's V6 makes up to 250 horsepower.The content-heavy base LX and dressed-up EX trim levels are available with two- or four-wheel drive. The 4WD transfer case is a shift-on-the-fly affair operated via a poorly located dash-mounted button. The Passport feels undersprung off-road and mushy on the highway, failing to please in either environment. Isuzu's Rodeo gets a driver-selectable suspension system to help in this regard, but doesn't share that particular toy with Honda.Four-wheel-drive models get disc brakes at each corner, while rear-wheel-drive models get discs in front and drums in back. For safety, ABS and dual front airbags are standard on all models. Power windows, power locks, dual power mirrors, cruise, air conditioning and an eight-speaker stereo with cassette are also standard. The EX trim level adds a four-speed automatic transmission, foglights, interior woodgrain trim, leather-wrapped steering wheel, 16-inch alloy wheels, dual heated power mirrors, power moonroof and keyless remote entry. There's also a luxury package for the EX that includes a four-way power driver seat, leather upholstery and door panel trim, in-dash CD changer and two-tone paint with body side molding.Fit and finish fails to live up to Honda standards, but most materials are of decent quality. You and your passengers will also appreciate the Passport's user-friendly ergonomics. Front seat comfort is lacking, but rear seats are roomy and supportive. With the backseat folded down, 81.1 cubic feet of cargo space is available.Outside, the Passport is a handsome devil. Its square profile has the aspect of compact muscularity, making it a natural campsite companion. A luxury package-equipped EX, with its multi-spoked alloy wheels, two-tone paint and body cladding, is equally well suited to carry you to the opera.Competitors in this segment get all the attention for a reason. Considering that we've had less than stellar experiences with the Passport and Isuzu Rodeo, and considering that J.D. Power and Associates' names the Passport one of the poorest quality vehicles sold, we recommend shopping for something else. Even if that something else is a Rodeo, which comes with a far superior warranty package.",V6 cylinder ,165,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Subaru,subaru legacy,2015,subaru legacy 2015,"['Standard all-wheel drive', 'excellent outward visibility', 'spacious cabin', 'top crash test scores.']","['Lackluster acceleration compared to top rivals', 'stiffer ride than many competitors.']",4.1,"The 2015 Subaru Legacy is redesigned. Highlights include subtle exterior changes, upgraded interior materials and improved fuel economy. A roomy cabin, an upgraded interior and standard all-wheel drive make the 2015 Subaru Legacy a solid pick for a midsize sedan, especially if rain and snow accompany your commute. Thanks to its offering standard  all-wheel-drive systems on nearly all of its cars, Subaru has  long been a popular choice for car buyers living in wet, snowy climates. But  the 2015 Subaru Legacy aims to deliver more than just all-weather capability. A  new look, improved fuel mileage, increased passenger comfort and new safety  features make the redesigned Legacy a more competitive sedan among its midsize  rivals.
Although the Legacy shares a similar look  and feel to last year's model, changes under the skin have resulted in more  passenger and cargo room. The cabin itself features nicer surfaces and  materials, although Subaru's frills-free philosophy carries over to its dash  and center stack layout. We like it for its simplicity and intuition, but some may  find it a bit too sparse.
Four- and six-cylinder engines carry over  but have been retuned to return better fuel economy. The 2.5-liter  four-cylinder now achieves an EPA-estimated 30 mpg combined, while the  six-cylinder gets a 10 percent bump in efficiency and now delivers 22 combined  mpg. Some shoppers may lament the disappearance of a six-speed manual  transmission for the four-cylinder engine, but the continuously variable  transmission (CVT) standard on all Legacys does a good job of extracting the  most performance from both engines.
These updates have made the 2015 Subaru  Legacy a more well-rounded midsize sedan, one that needn't rely solely on  all-wheel drive to sell. At the same time, however, the midsize sedan class is  loaded with excellent choices. Top models such as the 2015 Ford Fusion, 2015 Honda Accord, 2015 Mazda 6, 2015 Nissan Altima and 2015 Toyota Camry are  all excellent and can hold slight, but significant, advantages over the Legacy  in regards to style, technology and handling prowess.
Overall, it's hard to go wrong in this  segment. But if you want a refined and comfortable family sedan that can handle  any kind of weather -- or simply something different from its mainstream  competitors -- the 2015 Subaru Legacy merits strong consideration. The 2015 Subaru Legacy offers two engines:  a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 3.6-liter six-cylinder. The base 2.5-liter  horizontally opposed (""boxer"") four-cylinder produces 175 horsepower  and 174 pound-feet of torque. The six-cylinder generates 256  and 247 lb-ft  of torque. Both engines pair with the only available transmission: a CVT with  steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters.
During Edmunds track testing, a Legacy 2.5i  Premium ran from zero to 60 mph in 9.4 seconds. That's rather lackluster, as  many rivals accomplish the same sprint in less than 8 seconds.  
The EPA rates the four-cylinder Legacy at 30 mpg in combined driving (26 city/36 highway), an impressive result  in this class especially considering that all-wheel drive normally drags fuel  economy down a point or two. The six-cylinder Legacy returns 23 mpg combined (20 city/28 highway) -- an improvement on last year's model,  but still less impressive than the fuel economy of several competitors. The 2015 Subaru Legacy comes standard with  stability and traction control, antilock disc brakes, a rearview camera, front  side airbags, side curtain airbags and new seat cushion airbags that deploy  from the seat bottom to help keep occupants in place in a frontal collision.
Also optional is Subaru's EyeSight system that bundles adaptive cruise control, pre-collision  braking, lane-departure warning and sway warning. The EyeSight system uses two  cameras mounted inside the upper edge of the windshield, which Subaru says  reduces the potential for damage compared with conventional radar systems  mounted in the front bumper. EyeSight can also detect pedestrians and is  capable of braking the Legacy if the driver takes no evasive action for  potential frontal collisions.
In government crash testing, the Legacy earned a top five-star rating for overall  safety performance, with five stars in the  frontal- and side-impact categories. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Legacy received a top score of ""Good"" in moderate-overlap  frontal-offset, small-overlap frontal offset, side-impact and roof-strength testing. The Legacy's seat/head restraint design was also rated ""Good"" for whiplash  protection in rear impacts. 
In Edmunds brake  testing, a Legacy 2.5i Premium stopped from 60 mph in a short 114 feet, a  better-than-average performance for this  segment.  The 2015 Subaru Legacy's standard  all-wheel-drive system gives it plenty of capability in bad weather. The new  Legacy drives more smoothly, more quietly and more comfortably than before,  although the ride still isn't as cushy as some of its competitors. But this is a  good thing, as bumps and road rash are soaked up with a satisfying firmness  that delivers confidence behind the wheel. This is not a sport sedan by any  means, but it still delivers enough feedback to engage a discerning driver.
Both the four- and the six-cylinder engines are quiet and  provide class-acceptable acceleration. The standard CVT that comes with either  engine does an excellent job of getting the most out of the two power plants.  Although it can essentially mimic a broad range of gearing for maximum mileage,  this CVT is also programmed to deliver noticeable ""shifts"" to make it  feel more like a traditional transmission. Befitting the environments and uses of its  traditional owners, the 2015 Subaru Legacy features a simple and  straightforward interior design. Materials quality has improved compared to  last year, and there's more cushioning at common touch points like armrests and  the center console. The new, optional touchscreen navigation system can be  controlled using tablet-like gestures and delivers better response and  smartphone integration than the Legacy's last touchscreen-based system.
A slight repackaging delivers another 1.6  cubic feet of cabin space, realized in added room for arms, legs and elbows.  Rear legroom is just shy of what the Accord and Fusion offer. Despite the  Legacy's new, larger trunk, its 15 cubic feet of cargo capacity still trails  the competition a little, a compromise Subaru chalks up to the space required  for the Legacy's all-wheel-drive system.
A design change up front moves the  windshield forward slightly and improves on the Legacy's already excellent  outward visibility -- no small feat in an age of high door lines and bulky  pillars that result from modern safety standards. Firm, supportive seats and a  slightly higher driving position make the Legacy Subaru's most comfortable  sedan yet. 
Base 2.5i models come with 17-inch steel  wheels; automatic headlights; air-conditioning; cruise control; a  height-adjustable driver seat; a tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel; full  power accessories; a 60/40-split folding rear seat; a rearview camera;  Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity; and a four-speaker sound system with a  CD player, HD and satellite radio, an iPod/USB interface, an auxiliary audio  jack, and smartphone integration with Pandora  and Aha audio streaming. A 6.2-inch touchscreen display controls  most entertainment and phone functions. 
The 2.5i Premium adds 17-inch alloy wheels,  heated exterior mirrors, a windshield wiper de-icer, dual-zone automatic  climate control, an eight-way power driver seat (with power lumbar) heated  front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a rearview camera, upgraded  gauges and an upgraded audio system that includes six speakers, voice commands  and a 7-inch touchscreen display.
Available options for the 2.5i Premium  include a sunroof, a navigation system, an auto-dimming rearview mirror,  adaptive foglights, rear cross-traffic alert and Subaru's  EyeSight system. The latter combines adaptive cruise control, lane  departure warning and collision-warning/mitigation with brake intervention.  
Upgrading to the 2.5i Limited trim adds  18-inch alloy wheels, leather upholstery, a four-way power passenger seat,  driver memory functions, rear air vents, heated rear seats, rear cross-traffic  alert and a 12-speaker Harman Kardon sound system. Available options  are nearly identical to those offered on the Premium, but keyless ignition and  entry is also available.

An extra-small crossover SUV  that serves as the entry point for the automaker's SUV lineup, it is the second  least expensive Hyundai after the Accent sedan. Even so, it's ready to carry up  to five people and as much as 31.9 cubic feet of cargo. That's less than half  of what you get from the next size up SUV — a Honda CR-V, for example  — but it's still sufficient for most daily tasks. 
This  year's updates add standard equipment, especially for the midgrade Venue SEL. A  spiffy set of 17-inch alloy wheels improves the SEL's look, and it now includes  a blind-spot collision avoidance system, further cementing the Venue as a true  value leader among extra-small SUVs. The only deletion for 2021 is that the  six-speed manual transmission previously offered with the SE trim has been  dropped. As such, every Venue now comes standard with a continuously variable  automatic transmission.
Though  it doesn't offer much in the way of power and performance, the 2021 Venue  nevertheless brings significant style and tremendous bang-for-the-buck to the  extra-small SUV segment. Check out our  Expert Rating for our in-depth take on the pros and cons of this pint-size  Hyundai. Because  the Venue Denim provides less in the way of choice, we recommend the SEL trim level. It offers the greatest  blend of value, equipment and color choice. For 2021, the Venue SEL further  sweetens the deal with 17-inch alloy wheels and a blind-spot collision  avoidance system with rear cross-traffic collision avoidance warning as standard  equipment. How does the Venue drive? From behind the wheel, the Venue is perfectly adequate across the board. You'll have no issue commuting, running errands, or taking a cruise to the beach or lake. Acceleration is about average for this class, which is not fast by most accounts. At our test track, the Venue needed 9.4 seconds to get up to 60 mph.

   But it's good where it counts for a small city runabout, responding quickly right off the line, with its CVT automatic and easy brakes providing a pretty smooth driving experience overall. It's definitely not an athletic SUV, but its small size keeps it nimble and kind of fun to zip around corners. How comfortable is the Venue? You might assume based on its small size and low cost of entry that the Venue lacks comfort. Thankfully that's not the case. It's far from a luxurious experience, but the Venue fares well even compared with some larger rivals in its class. The front seats have a nice balance of cushion and support. The rear bench cushion is a bit flat, but there's a good recline to the backrest. Ride comfort can be tricky to maintain in smaller vehicles, but the Venue's won't beat you up even on longer trips.

   The climate control is single-zone only, which makes sense given the Venue's size, and we found it sufficient for keeping the cabin cool. There is some wind and road noise at highway speeds, but it's nothing out of the ordinary for this class. How’s the interior? The Venue's interior is practical, and passenger space is better than expected given its short length. It achieves this relative spaciousness through its upright seating. As long as you're not much taller than 6 feet, you should find the Venue relatively accommodating in front and cozy but livable in back. The squared-off doors make it pretty easy to get in and out of.

   The simplicity of the Venue keeps it easy to use. The 8-inch infotainment touchscreen is bright, responsive and easy to use. All other controls, buttons and knobs are clearly labeled and arranged logically. Forward and side visibility is pretty good, but your over-the-shoulder view is hampered somewhat by the thick rear roof pillars. The available blind-spot monitoring system certainly helps alleviate this issue when switching lanes. How’s the tech? The Venue has just the right amount of technology, and it's easy and straightforward to use. The available six-speaker sound system produces surprisingly good sound that's clear and has a nice amount of punch. The 8-inch touchscreen infotainment/navigation system comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. The navigation system is very reminiscent of today's smartphones in look and feel, and real-time traffic information is nice to have.

   The advanced safety and driver aids work but seem a bit oversensitive. It's worth noting that adaptive cruise is not offered on the Venue in case that's an important feature on your list. How’s the storage? The Venue is small, so there's only so much you can physically fit inside. We think it makes excellent use of the space it does have, however. There's 18.7 cubic feet behind the rear seats (31.9 cubic feet with rear seats folded), which we found sufficient for everyday use.

   The cargo area offers a couple of cool things: an adjustable load floor and a stowable cargo cover. The loading area has a wide opening and low loading height to make it easy to get things in. Up front, there's a sufficient amount of storage space for your personal items. As for child duty, the Venue's car seat anchor points are clearly marked on the seatback and easy to access. But the lack of rear legroom will make it hard to fit a larger rear-facing child safety seat. How’s the fuel economy? The EPA estimates the Venue's fuel economy at 31 mpg combined (30 city/33 highway), a pretty efficient estimate for this class. But we found it tough to match that in our real-world driving. On our highway-heavy 115-mile evaluation route, we averaged a mere 29 mpg. Perhaps it's due to our need to keep up with the flow of California traffic, but we suspect the EPA figures are a bit optimistic for a Venue roaming in the wild. Is the Venue a good value? Good value? No. We'd call this an excellent value. The Venue is well built and relatively practical. For what you pay, Hyundai packs in a lot of features. Some vehicles start where the Venue tops out on price and don't have the same amount of tech.

   Hyundai's warranty is best in class. It includes five-year/60,000 bumper-to-bumper and 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranties. Roadside assistance is provided for five years with no mileage limit, and all Hyundais now come with free scheduled maintenance for three years/36,000 miles. Is it fun to drive? Not really. The Venue is very utilitarian and that seems to be the core focus. The styling of the Venue is also rather nondescript, blending into the sea of subcompact SUVs. If you want something more distinctive, look elsewhere, at perhaps Mazda's CX-30 or even Kia's Soul or Seltos.",Inline 4 cylinder ,255,,front wheel drive , Continuously variable-speed automatic

They also receive standard 17-inch wheels, and V6 Convertibles get 16-inch wheels as standard. All cars have a revised center console and blacked-out headlights and spoilers. The Mach 460 stereo system comes with an in-dash six-disc CD changer. A new ""premium"" trim line is created for both V6 and V8 models. After a one-year hiatus, the Ford SVT Mustang Cobra returns for 2001. The original pony car is still one of the best, and there's a good reason for this sport coupe's longevity. Now 37 years old, the Mustang is quickly approaching middle age. But if it's going through a mid-life crisis, nobody is noticing. The Mustang is as popular as ever.Ford's sport coupe has outsold GM's F-bodies -- the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird -- the last six years in a row. This is in spite of the fact that the Mustang has suffered a performance disadvantage since its redesign in 1994.There are four models: the V6 Coupe, the V6 Convertible, the GT Coupe and the GT Convertible. All models can be ordered in either deluxe or premium trim. There is also a standard trim available on V6 coupes only. All V6 models have a 3.8-liter pushrod engine that makes 190 horsepower at 5,250 and 225 foot-pounds of torque at 2,800 rpm. Power is acceptable, though V6 Coupes definitely have a rental-car stigma attached to them.The GT Coupe and Convertible are more in-tune with what pony cars should be. Equipped with a 4.6-liter SOHC V8, GT output is listed at 260 horsepower at 5,250 and 302 foot-pounds of torque at 4,000 rpm. If that still isn't enough, you should know Ford has brought back the SVT Mustang Cobra this year. Because of production problems with '99 SVT Mustang Cobras (they weren't making the power they were supposed to), Ford took the car off-line for 2000 to get everything sorted out.The Ford SVT Mustang Cobra is a high-performance Mustang that has been heavily modified by Ford's Special Vehicle Team (SVT). Available in either coupe or convertible, the SVT Cobra's main calling cards are a totally different engine, a revised suspension, and an improved interior. The Cobra's firepower comes from a 4.6-liter, 32-valve DOHC V8. While based on Ford's family of modular V8s, the Cobra's engine is considerably more advanced. The engine produces 320 horsepower at 6,000 and 317 ft-lbs. of torque at 4,750 rpm.All Mustangs offer drivers and passengers supportive, upright front chairs, well-placed controls, clear views out the front and side windows, and acceptable dashboard and seat materials. For 2001, Ford upgraded the center console by adding a larger rear cupholder and repositioning the front cupholder, power point, tissue holder and parking brake boot. The standard, deluxe and premium trim groups offer varying levels of standard and optional equipment, with the premium trim group being the most inclusive.Another advantage of the Mustang is its demeanor on the road. The Mustang's suspension allows the car to be predictable during hard cornering and side-to-side weight transfers are progressive for added stability during high-speed lane changes. The braking and steering have also impressed us. Rough pavement can make the ride uncomfortable in base- and GT-model Mustangs, however, as the rear suspension still uses a solid rear axle.The Mustang has always been crashworthy, offering drivers and front-seat passengers a high level of protection as rated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. All-speed traction control and antilock brakes are standard on most trim levels. Ford thoughtfully provides a traction-control defeat switch for those people who like roasting the rear tires on a regular basis.As for the rest of us, Mustang is one of the most recognizable nameplates on the road. And since the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird are scheduled for termination in 2002, the Mustang may be the only pony car left for the new millennium.",V6 cylinder ,365,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

K1500 models have a tighter turning radius for better maneuverability.  Automatic transmissions are refined to provide smoother shifts and improved efficiency.  Three new paint colors debut. GM has figured out a way to steal some thunder from the Dodge Ram and the new Ford F-Series.  Their entire line of truck engines was refined last year, infused with notable horsepower and torque increases.  For good measure, engineers made the rear portion of the extended cab model more accessible via a trick panel that opens wide from the passenger's side to make loading cargo or people much easier.Every Sierra gasoline engine, from the base V-6 to the king-of-the-hill V-8, benefit from Vortec technology which provide healthy power and torque ratings.  For example, the standard 4300 V-6 makes an ample 200 horsepower, and the optional 5700 V-8 is a much more satisfying powerplant than Ford's new overhead cam designs.  Also available are regular- and heavy-duty turbodiesels sporting 6.5 liters of displacement.  All Sierras have four-wheel anti-lock braking.The side access panel makes the extended cab model a true family vehicle.  Loading cargo into the rear of the cab is much easier too.  To qualify for the side access panel, you must order a 1500 extended cab shortbed equipped with SLE or SLT trim and a Vortec 5000 or Vortec 5700 engine mated to an automatic transmission.  In contrast, Ford provides a third door standard on all extended cab models, making life much easier.Other comforts aren't forgotten, either.  Automakers are constantly trying to make their trucks more car-like, so GM has made rear seat heating ducts standard on the Sierra.  Shoulder belts are height adjustable to fit a variety of physiques, and upholstery choices include leather.  Heck, you'd hardly know this was a truck, especially with the passenger car tires that give some versions of the Sierra a nicer ride and quieter interior.Improvements for 1997 include a new passenger airbag on models under 8,600 lbs. GVWR, and the airbag can be deactivated for those times when a rear-facing child safety seat is installed.  Speed-sensitive steering that boosts power assist at low speeds to make parking easier has been added.  On the open road, this system firms up the steering for improved road feel.  All K1500 Sierras get a tighter turning radius this year for better maneuverability, and the automatic transmission shifts more smoothly this year thanks to revised hardware.Although Chevrolet's own C/K Series garners the greatest amount of publicity, GMC's equivalents are pretty strong sellers themselves, approaching 190,000 units each year.  Sierras, in fact, account for close to half of GMC output.  Americans continue to clamor for burly pickups, whether for their macho image or for real work.  Whether you choose a light-duty two-wheel-drive (C1500) or the massive four-wheel-drive K3500 Club Coupe, on a 155.5-inch wheelbase, GMC gives both Chevrolet and its Ford/Dodge rivals a run for their money.",V6 cylinder ,165,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Lower-powered airbags are not available on the Corvette. More than 40 years after the 1953 Corvette debuted, Chevrolet introduced the fifth-generation Corvette for 1997.  The C5 almost didn't happen.  Originally scheduled for release in 1993, the Corvette was killed for a short time before performance zealots within General Motors resuscitated the project and made the new car a reality.Pushrod power continues, in the form of a reworked 5.7-liter V8 engine dubbed the LS1.  Horsepower is 345 at 5,600 rpm, while torque measures 350 foot-pounds at 4,400 rpm.  The result?  Equipped with the standard four-speed automatic transmission, the Corvette will hit 60 mph in a shade over five seconds.  Opt for the six-speed manual transmission and you'll cut less than half a second off the trap time.  To help reign the power in on slippery surfaces, acceleration slip regulation (aka traction control) is standard equipment.  EPA mileage figures are phenomenal for a high-powered sports car; the Corvette will return 28 mpg on the highway with the manual tranny.Four-wheel disc antilock brakes keep stopping distances short with larger rotors than previous Corvettes.  Front tires are 17 inches in diameter, and rears are a whopping 18 inches across, which contributes to an excellent .93g of road grip.  The rubber stays planted well too, thanks to a fully independent four-wheel short/long-arm height-adjustable suspension.Body panels are still composed of a material other than metal, though no longer fiberglass.  Sheet molded compound wraps around an ultra-stiff structure that features a full-length perimeter frame with tubular steel side rails.  The windshield frame is aluminum, and the instrument panel is attached directly to a beefy cross member designed to reduce noise and vibration.  A sandwich composite floor with a lightweight balsa wood core damps noise and vibration while making the floor exceptionally stiff.Inside, a dashboard with real analog gauges and intuitive radio and climate controls greets passengers.  Luggage space beneath the coupe's rear hatch glass is an incredible 25 cubic feet, made possible with the use of dual mid-ship mounted fuel tanks that are snuggled within the Corvette's structure.  The car feels more airy inside, thanks to a narrower door sill and taller height combined with a low cowl.Yes, the Corvette is an outstanding effort and competes favorably with the best in the class.  Unfortunately, to our eyes, it doesn't look like a million bucks.  Long, low and lean, the Corvette is certainly attractive.  We take issue, however, with the thick truncated tail and the odd-looking air scoops for the front brakes.  Other critics have complained of derivative styling cues and the lack of chrome-finished exhaust tips.  Still, the Corvette's new shape will wear well into the next century, particularly in convertible format.Don't let the fact that the C5 will swallow two golf bags sway you into thinking this a gentrified sporting coupe.

BMWs are famous for the suppleness of their ride and the responsiveness of their steering; ""firmness without harshness"" is the phrase most often bandied about our offices when discussing these cars' uncanny ability to stay connected to the road while communicating almost telepathically with the driver.  The 5-Series is no exception.  Available in two flavors, 528i or 540i, drivers can choose a sedan bodystyle or new sport wagon.   528i models are powered by a 2.8-liter inline engine that provides excellent midrange torque and makes 193 horsepower, up from 190 last year. The 528i comes standard with a five-speed manual transmission and is also available with a sophisticated four-speed automatic.  Equipped with BMW's Adaptive Transmission Control, the four-speed tracks the driver's driving style and road conditions, allowing the shift timing to adjust accordingly. This year, both cars receive car and key memory as standard equipment, Dynamic Stability Control (DCSIII) as an option, and a revised Sports Package option, which offers 17-inch alloy wheels, high performance tires, a sport suspension, M-sport steering wheel and shadowline blackout exterior trim.  Under the hoods of the 540i sedans and sport wagons sit 4.4-liter, 32-valve V8s that offer zero-to-sixty times in the low sixes, make 282 horsepower and can be mated to five-speed Steptronic automatic transmissions.  The 540i sedan continues to be available with a five-speed automatic or a six-speed manual transmission while the new 540i sport wagon comes with the Steptronic tranny standard.  Other standard equipment includes rear self-leveling suspension, car and key memory, roof rails, retractable luggage net and Dynamic Stability Control.  All 540s get new radial style alloy wheels and high performance tires for 1999, as well as new option packages to choose from.  If you love to drive, opt for the six-speed manual 540i and prepare yourself for an invigorating ride.

Safety equipment includes four-wheel antilock disc brakes, traction control, nine-mph bumpers, dual airbags, side-impact airbags, optional rear passenger side-impact airbags, three-point seatbelts at all seating positions, impact sensors that unlock the doors and activate the hazard lights in the event of a serious accident, remote keyless entry, two-step unlocking, coded drive-away protection, and a vehicle security system.  To list all of the 5-Series' luxury features would take more space than we have; a few of the more noticeable ones are automatic climate controls, power moonroof, 200-watt stereo, 10-way power front seats with power headrests, heated outside mirrors, heated steering wheel, and a right-hand outside mirror that tilts down when the car is in reverse to help drivers see curbs when parallel parking.Yes indeed, the 5-Series is a wonderful car.

Ford,ford shelby-gt500,2013,ford shelby-gt500 2013,"['Incredible power', 'inspiring engine note', 'aggressive styling', 'relative exclusivity.']","['Harsh optional suspension', 'unimpressive interior', 'no telescoping steering wheel.']",4.8,"For 2013, the Ford Shelby GT500 receives an astonishing increase to 662 horsepower. Wait, did you get that? Six-hundred and sixty-two! With a new top speed in excess of 200 mph, the GT500 also receives plenty of exterior, interior and mechanical upgrades to keep it on the road. With enough power to corrupt the most virtuous among us, at a price that is not so far out of reach, the 2013 Ford Shelby GT500 will likely be one of the most memorable Mustangs of all time. ""A sense of power is the most intoxicating stimulant a mortal can enjoy."" -- Ellen Swallow Richards
Truer words (albeit penned a century ago) will likely not be found to describe the 2013 Ford Shelby GT500. We were already smitten with the 2012 model and its raucous 550- engine, but Ford has us downright obsessed with its new 662- power plant. That figure vaults this mega Mustang well into supercar territory, taking the prize for the most powerful production V8. Ever.
Power without control, however, is merely wasted excess. With this in mind, the 2013 Shelby GT500 has also been endowed with additional equipment intended to keep it from ending up upside-down and in flames. A new front splitter improves high-speed stability, and with a top speed in excess of 200 mph, keeping the tires in contact with the road is most certainly a priority.
Other additions include standard launch control, Brembo brakes, a carbon-fiber driveshaft, quad exhaust pipes and Mustang Track Apps (showing acceleration, braking and g-force performance) in a new display in the gauge cluster. The optional SVT Performance package piles on more upgrades, including a race-tuned suspension and cockpit-adjustable dampers.
Taking into account all of these performance-enhancing features, it becomes a little easier to justify the GT500's $25,000 premium over the already competent Mustang GT. To the Shelby GT500's detriment, though, its interior is too similar to the base Mustang and a far cry from expectations of a $55,000 car.
Then again, if you're wrestling with 662 , interior quality is probably the last thing on your mind. Considering this torrent of power and a price tag that is a fraction of what you would expect from similarly exotic, powerful cars, the 2013 Ford Shelby GT500 represents a relative bargain (at least, that's a line you can use on your significant other). It out-muscles the 2012 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 and 2012 Corvette ZR1 and dominates the 2012 Dodge Challenger SRT8. Furthermore, the Shelby has the potential to battle with the hyper-exotics from Italy and Germany (at least in a straight line). If you're fortunate to enjoy one of these limited-edition stimulants, just remember that you are indeed, mortal. Powering the 2013 Ford Shelby GT500 is a 5.8-liter supercharged V8 that generates an awe-inspiring 662  and 631 pound-feet of torque. Just as impressive as the peak output is the fact that 395 lb-ft of that torque is available just off idle. A six-speed manual is the only transmission available.
Despite the lofty power output and performance figures, the EPA estimates fuel economy at a fairly reasonable 15 mpg city/24 mpg highway and 18 mpg in combined driving. Standard safety features for the 2013 Ford Shelby GT500 include antilock disc brakes, traction control, stability control and front-seat side airbags. Ford's MyKey system (which allows you to limit the car's top speed and stereo volume) is also standard. A temporary tire-inflation kit replaces the spare tire.
In government crash tests, the Ford Mustang coupe on which the GT500 is based received an overall safety score of four stars (out of a possible five). Within that rating, it earned four overall stars for frontal-impact safety and four stars overall for side-impact safety. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Mustang coupe its top score of ""Good"" in frontal-offset crash protection and a second-best score of ""Acceptable"" for side-impact tests. Fire up the 2013 Ford Shelby GT500 and you're treated to one of the meanest-sounding engines ever built. At idle, the low, rhythmic rumble disguises the potential for tire-smoking mayhem. Lay into the throttle and the rumbling becomes a raging torrent as the GT500 catapults forward, all the while accompanied by the supercharger's addictive whine.
In the corners, the GT500 is easily upset by careless inputs. Maximizing thrills in the curves requires a high level of restraint and a healthy dose of courage. There's plenty of grip, but the Shelby's heavy curb weight seem poised to break the car loose at all times. The ride is stiff, but not too harsh. Except for some suede trim, Cobra badges and a cue-ball shift knob, the GT500 interior isn't much different from that of a well-appointed Mustang GT. The abundance of hard plastics and similarities to lesser-trim Mustangs in a $55,000 car is slightly disappointing. Gauges are slightly more legible than the hieroglyphics found in the standard Mustang, but both place the optional multifunction display too low in the center stack. Climate and audio controls are also small and hard to read at a quick glance; thankfully, the Sync voice-activated control interface nearly eliminates the need to bother. Outward visibility is best-in-class thanks to thin A-pillars and flip-down rear headrests.
Interior storage is notably scarce, with a shallow center armrest bin and a small glovebox and door pockets. The coupe's trunk can hold a generous 13.4 cubic feet of cargo, and split-folding rear seats allow you to load larger objects. The convertible lacks the folding seats and can only hold a maximum of 9.6 cubes. It's important to note, however, that these capacities do not take into account the optional massive Shaker subwoofer that essentially squanders one corner of the trunk.
Front seats are generally comfortable, although taller drivers may bemoan the lack of a telescoping steering column. Nearly any rear seat passenger, regardless of size, will find scarce legroom among their chief concerns. 
Standard features include 19-inch alloy front wheels (20-inch rear wheels), high-performance tires, Brembo brakes, a rear spoiler, automatic xenon headlights, foglights, keyless entry, air-conditioning, cruise control, Mustang Track Apps, a leather/faux-suede-wrapped steering wheel, leather/faux-suede-upholstered sport bucket seats with racing stripes and Cobra logos, a power driver seat, Ford's Sync multimedia voice control system and an eight-speaker sound system with a CD player, auxiliary/USB audio jacks and satellite radio.
The GT500 convertible adds a power-operated soft top. Both the GT500 coupe and convertible have side stripes on the rocker panels and hood stripes that run from nose to tail (but not over the convertible top). Ford offers a stripe-delete option for buyers who prefer a less ostentatious look.
Options include a glass roof for the coupe, leather Recaro front seats, heated front seats (but not for the Recaros), an upgraded nine-speaker sound system, an Electronics package (hard-drive-based navigation system, HD radio and dual-zone climate control), the SVT Performance package (unique wheels, a Torsen 3.31 limited-slip differential, cockpit-adjustable Bilstein dampers, stiffer rear springs and a unique shift knob) and the SVT Track Pack (additional coolers for the engine oil, transmission and differential).",V8 cylinder ,135,,rear wheel drive , 6-speed manual

The Trailblazer name has been absent since 2009 in the U.S. In  many ways, this reboot follows the same playbook of the larger Blazer SUV that  Chevy reintroduced last year. 
For  starters, the Trailblazer is similar to the Blazer in that it has hardly  anything to do with its forebear other than the name. The old TrailBlazer (with  a capital B) was a truck-based midsize SUV. This new Trailblazer (lowercase b!)  is a smaller crossover SUV with car-based architecture. Also like the Blazer,  the 2021 Trailblazer adopts some Camaro-like exterior styling cues for a  uniquely aggressive appearance. 
The  Trailblazer also stands out slightly from other subcompact crossovers by  offering the Activ trim level. Chevy has tuned it for off-road use by adding  specialized all-season tires, revised shock absorbers, and a bit more ground  clearance from a reshaped front fascia. The Activ also gets roof rails on a  two-tone roof. 
The  Trailblazer's edgy styling fits right into this class of extra-small SUVs. And  unlike rivals such as the Toyota C-HR, the Trailblazer doesn't sacrifice  utility in the name of style. It has a pleasing amount of passenger and cargo  space, a relatively comfortable ride, and decent power from the optional  turbocharged 1.3-liter engine. 
We've  never been particularly fond of the Chevrolet Trax, especially compared to  class leaders such as the Mazda CX-30, Hyundai Kona, Kia Soul and Honda HR-V.  The new Trailblazer, however, is a strong competitor right out of the gate.  It's worth checking out if you're shopping for a stylish and comfortable  pint-sized SUV.  We  suggest stepping up to the 1.3-liter turbocharged engine since the base engine  feels underpowered. Beyond that, consider getting the midrange LT trim. It adds  a lot of standard features you'll appreciate, such as cruise control and  keyless ignition and entry, and grants access to most of the Trailblazer's  optional packages.",Inline 3 cylinder ,137,,front wheel drive , Continuously variable-speed automatic

On the outside, there's a new three-section grille and swoopier headlights, subtly restyled fenders for the sedan and new taillight clusters. New trims include a less expensive WRX TR sedan and an upscale WRX Limited sedan and wagon. The 2.5 RS trim level becomes the 2.5 i. Mechanically, the WRX's engine goes from 2.0 liters to 2.5 liters of displacement and now makes 230  and 235 lb-ft of torque. Other Imprezas get a horsepower boost from last year's 165  to 173. The WRX line also gets aluminum front suspension links, standard 17-inch wheels, upgraded brakes with red four-piston calipers up front, and a quicker steering ratio. From the 2.5 i wagon to the WRX, the all-wheel-drive 2006 Subaru Impreza is a practical, fun-to-drive alternative to the typically dull cars that populate its segment of the market. Are you looking for a small car or wagon? Just about every automaker offers one. How are you to choose? Well, if you want your car to be more than just basic transportation, consider the Subaru Impreza. It's been on the market for over a decade now, but only in the last several years has it gained the kind of style and performance that make it such an appealing vehicle. When it was last redesigned in 2002, the Subaru Impreza not only gained more room and features, it spawned a high-performance model known as the WRX. Packing a turbocharged engine and a sport-tuned suspension, the Impreza WRX can keep pace with many cars costing thousands more. It's even available as a wagon.If the Impreza WRX doesn't suit your needs, there are other trim levels available, including the Outback Sport, a more rugged version for buyers who want extra utility without having to pay for a full-blown Outback. All trim levels offer well-laid-out interiors, numerous options and solid build quality. Standard all-wheel-drive continues to be the Impreza's drawing card, and a healthy price reduction on base models this year makes buying the 2006 Subaru Impreza a pretty irresistible proposition. Powering all 2.5 i and Outback Sport models is a 2.5-liter, horizontally opposed four-cylinder engine that makes 173 horsepower. A more powerful engine can be found in the WRX sedan and wagon. This turbocharged 2.5-liter mill (also a flat four) kicks out an impressive 230  and 235 lb-ft of torque. Transmission choices are a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. All-wheel drive is standard on all Imprezas. All Subaru Impreza models have standard four-wheel antilock disc brakes. Side airbags are standard on all models. In government crash testing, the Subaru Impreza earned four stars (out of five) for driver safety in frontal impacts and five stars for front-passenger safety. Five stars were awarded for front-seat side-impact safety. The IIHS named the Impreza a ""Best Pick"" in frontal-offset testing. There's no question that the 2006 Subaru Impreza WRX sedan and wagon are an absolute blast to drive. Previously, the WRX's power delivery was soft at low but the new 2.5-liter turbo provides more bottom-end pull and an even deeper midrange. Handling is superb thanks to a well-tuned suspension and standard all-wheel drive. Although not nearly as fast, the 2.5 i sedan and wagon are equally enjoyable to toss around on a twisty road. The Outback Sport may have a sportier look, but the less expensive 2.5 i wagon is the better handler. Though by no means a match for the cockpit of a Jetta, the Impreza's dash is modern enough in appearance, and the materials used are of good quality. For cargo, the wagons can hold 27.9 cubic feet of stuff, or 61.6 cubic feet with the rear seats folded flat. The high-performance Impreza WRX comes in three different versions: WRX TR, regular WRX and WRX Limited. The TR features a functional hood scoop, limited-slip rear differential, stiffer suspension, bigger brakes and unique wheels. The standard WRX adds STi ground effects, foglamps, aluminum pedal covers, automatic climate control, premium audio with CD changer and performance-design seats. The luxury-oriented Limited features leather seating, heated seats and mirrors, and a moonroof.",Flat 4 cylinder ,140,,all wheel drive , 5-speed manual

The 2023 GMC Acadia  fits the description. And as a bonus, it comes in several styles, from the  standard version to the flashy Denali, plus the bulked-up AT4 for the  appearance of off-road adventuring. Whichever trim interests you, GMC hopes  that you'll find the Acadia to be more upscale than some of its midsize SUV  rivals, but not as expensive as a luxury SUV. 
It's  a nice idea, but we're not quite sold. This second-generation Acadia has been  around since 2017 and has fallen behind more modern rivals such as the Hyundai  Palisade and Kia Telluride. These two related SUVs provide more utility and  better interior quality at a similar price. There are also the redesigned 2023  Honda Pilot, the relatively new Jeep Grand Cherokee L and the roomy Volkswagen  Atlas to consider. Our test team finds the Acadia to be a decent pick, but odds  are you'll find one of these other SUVs to be more to your liking overall.  Check  out the SLT trim, particularly for  its upgraded power-adjustable seats, cushier interior and improved stereo over  the base model. That brings the Acadia more in line with its premium image, and  the foglights and roof rails add functionality at a friendly price.

A versatile alternative to mainstream wagons and SUVs. What recipe does an automotive manufacturer use to boost sagging sales? Ask any Subaru executive and she'll tell you to take one part popular Australian movie star and one part advanced all-wheel-drive system. Stir in an undercurrent of SUV backlash with a dash of resurgence in the station wagon market, and behold: The perfect environment for a totally new Subaru Outback.  Available in either wagon or sedan form, the Outback is Subaru's answer to the question: Why would anyone want to drive an ill-handling, gas-guzzling, difficult to park SUV? With 7.3 inches of ground clearance, standard all-wheel drive and a base price in the low 20s, the Outback offers on-road practicality with off-road capability at a bargain price. While no match for the likes of Jeep's Grand Cherokee or Toyota's Land Cruiser in terms of hill climbing, the Outback can hold its own in light to moderate off-road situations without losing an oil pan or cracking a differential.A Phase II 2.5-liter, 16-valve, 165-horsepower boxer engine powers both Outback models. By reconfiguring the engine's valvetrain, Subaru squeezed a bit more torque from the 2.5-liter, upping the total to 166 foot-pounds @ 4,000 rpm. All models come with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The Outback Wagon and Outback Limited Sedan come with both the four-speed automatic and Subaru's Active All-Wheel Drive that can transfer power to the wheels that need it even before slippage occurs.Additionally, all Outbacks receive four-wheel disc brakes, ABS, protective lower body cladding, a heavy-duty four-wheel independent suspension, and 24-hour roadside assistance as standard equipment. Opt for the Outback wagon and you'll also get a 60/40 split folding rear seat, keyless entry, a 12-volt cargo area power outlet, a rear wiper/washer, and breakaway power side-view mirrors. Limited models, in sedan or wagon configuration, get leather upholstery, heated seats, a CD player, and a power moonroof (dual moonroofs on the wagon). Safety was another area where Subaru refused to skimp. The new Outback models feature a ""Ring-Shaped Reinforcement"" body structure for maximum protection against frontal, offset, side and rear impacts. Side beams in both the front and rear doors further enhance side-impact protection, but, regrettably, only the Limited models come with side airbags. These structural enhancements not only boost safety but also improve the Outback's torsional strength by 20 percent. Combined with the new multi-link rear suspension and rubber-isolated subframe, the sedans and wagons offer superior handling and reduced road noise compared to last year's models.We like the fact that Subaru offers a viable alternative to the SUV. The Outback proves that safety, style and all-weather traction can be had in a non-truck-based vehicle, and at a reasonable price. Now if we could just get one of their turbocharged engines from Japan over here.",Flat 4 cylinder ,,,all wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Chevrolet,chevrolet corvette,2023,chevrolet corvette 2023,,"['Not the easiest car to get in and out of', 'Poor rear visibility', 'Lacks some of the latest advanced driver safety features']",,"Since  the Chevrolet Corvette's debut in the 1950s, it's become one of America's most  successful sports cars and a household name. The current C8 model is a  mid-engine masterpiece boasting exotic styling and performance that's on par  with vehicles two to three times its price. For 2023, Chevrolet introduced the  more powerful and higher-performing Z06. It's currently the only  high-performance variant that's offered above the base Stingray model.  
The  centerpiece of the new Z06 is the all-new LT6 5.5-liter V8 engine. It's not  turbocharged or supercharged, and it's actually smaller than the standard  6.2-liter V8, but it packs some race-inspired technology. The Z06's V8 features  a lightweight flat-plane crankshaft that's normally found on high-dollar exotic  cars, and it has a sky-high redline of 8,600 rpm. That's 2,100 higher than  the standard Corvette Stingray's. Those enchantments, among others, allow the  engine to generate a whopping 670 horsepower and 460 lb-ft of torque. 
But  that's just the beginning. When compared to the standard Corvette, the Z06 also  includes larger and wider wheels, gripper tires, performance-oriented adaptive  suspension dampers and larger Brembo brakes. It also has distinct front and  rear styling and a shorter drive ratio for quicker acceleration. Speaking of  acceleration, Chevy claims the Z06 can blast from 0 to 60 mph in an astonishing  2.6 seconds. 
The  2023 model year also sees the addition of the 70th Anniversary Special Edition  model. It's a package of visual enhancements such as 70th Anniversary badging,  unique wheels, dual racing stripes, red brake calipers, a red engine cover, red  seat belts, upgraded leather upholstery with red stitching, and more. The C8.R  edition, which was new last year and featured unique colors and graphics, has  been discontinued. 
If  you're in the market for a highly capable sports car, the Corvette's blend of  performance, comfort and price makes it hard to pass up. And if you want more,  the Z06's Ferrari-like capability is well worth its six-figure price tag. When  comparing performance numbers, the Corvette can compete against more expensive  vehicles, but if you want to stay in its price range, take a look at the BMW M4  and Porsche Cayman. If you have a larger budget, consider the Z06, and make  sure to check out the Porsche 911. To help you decide, read our test team's  full review of the Corvette in the Edmunds Expert Rating below.
What's it like to live with?
Edmunds  bought a 2020 Chevrolet Corvette, and so far we have put over 25,000 miles on  it. We love its performance and comfort, and surprisingly for a V8-powered  sports car, its average mpg. We've kept track of its maintenance costs and  share what we think of its technology and what it's like as a daily driver. For  complete details and for several videos, make sure to check out our Corvette long-term  road test. The  Corvette's midlevel 2LT trim (or the  Z06's 2LZ trim) is the one to get  for the most value. It includes the generous list of features found in the base  trim and adds heated and ventilated seats, a front-view parking camera to help  prevent damaging the Corvette's nose, and blind-spot warning with rear  cross-traffic warning for a safer driving experience.",V8 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 8-speed automated manual 
Audi,audi tt,2000,audi tt 2000,"['Distinct styling, sharp handling, unique interior, optional all-wheel drive.']","[""Useless back seat, poor interior ergonomics, horsepower doesn't match what the exterior promises.""]",4.6,"Audi introduces the funky-looking TT Coupe for the 2000 model year. A turbocharged, 1.8-liter engine squeezes out 180 horsepower for this avant-garde sports car. An artistic triumph in styling, the new 2000 Audi TT Coupe is fun to drive and suitably plush. But we'd advise most people to hold out for the more powerful 2001 quattro model. The 2000 Audi TT Coupe concept car was introduced in 1995, and we hated it. When Audi announced they would build the TT, we scoffed, calling it the automotive equivalent of Miss Piggy. Then, we got up close and personal with the TT at various motor shows and driving evaluations. You could say we've developed an acquired taste for the design.In person, the car just looks right, appearing aggressive and graceful at the same time. The rear boasts rounded flanks and a cleanly arced roofline. Purposeful styling details are executed with ice-cold precision; it is an instant classic -- a shape that will be a topic of discussion for years. The base Audi TT comes with a front-engine, front-drive powertrain layout. Its turbocharged, 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine makes 180 horsepower and is connected to a standard five-speed manual transmission. Audi's quattro all-wheel-drive system is optional, and there is currently no automatic transmission available.Inside, Audi has created a ""visual and tactile feast"" of aluminum, leather and stainless steel. The effect is successful, appearing to be expensively outfitted, but not luxurious in the traditional sense. And, thanks to the hatchback design, the TT offers owners some utility, carrying 13.8 cubic feet of cargo with the rear seat up and 24.2 cubic feet if the rear seat is folded down. Owners might want to keep the rear seats lowered permanently, as they are otherwise useless for hauling people.Standard equipment includes leather sport seats, cruise control, a tachometer, alloy wheels, a split folding rear seat, and an AM/FM stereo with cassette and speed-sensitive volume control. A six-disc CD changer is optional. Power seats, a sunroof and a full-size spare tire are not available on this car.To keep passengers safe, Audi installed ABS, traction control and a first-aid kit in the TT.  Head and thorax side airbags are also standard.  Pre-tensioners and force limiters make seatbelts even more effective than conventional systems and next-generation front airbags deploy at lower speeds.   The TT's styling will make it popular with people who like to impress. However, the horsepower coming from the turbo engine seems to be lacking given the base $30,500 MSRP. True sporting enthusiasts will want to wait until a more powerful version of the TT arrives sometime next year.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Its lusty V8 engine aside, the 2021 Lexus RC F is increasingly  anachronistic in a segment that includes the likes of the Audi RS 5, BMW M4 and  Mercedes-AMG C 63.  Still,  Lexus is doing its best to keep RC F fresh. There's a new limited-production  Fuji Speedway Edition this year. And when we say limited, we mean it. Lexus  plans to build just 60 examples of the car. It comes with special paint and  extra carbon-fiber body panels, among other extras. All RC Fs also have more  standard features this year. The  RC F is the last ""F"" model Lexus sells, now that the GS F sedan is  gone from the automaker's lineup. Soon, the new 2022 Lexus IS 500 F Sport  Performance arrives, equipped with the same V8 engine found under RC F's hood.  According to Lexus, it ""ushers in a new era of F Sport Performance  models."" If you read the tea leaves, it's easy to conclude that the RC F's  days might be numbered. Should you still get a 2021 RC F? Check out our Expert  Rating below for our in-depth evaluation.What's it like to live with?Edmunds  spent six months living with a 2015 Lexus RC F, and while the car has had many  improvements over the ensuing years, it is fundamentally the same  high-performance luxury coupe we put over 10,000 miles on at the time. If  you're curious about what it's like to live with the Lexus RC F, check out our long-term test report. It's  all about the options since there's just one trim level of the RC F. Since this  car is best suited for cruising rather than maximum performance, it's probably  a good idea to get the Premium package (heated and ventilated front seats) and  the sweet-sounding Mark Levinson audio system. How does the RC F drive? The RC F comes with a responsive 472- V8, a trick active rear differential and an adaptive suspension. But none of it can fully overcome the RC F's beefy curb weight. We've yet to test the 2021 RC F, but in testing a 2018 model we were able to do 0-60 mph in 4.9 seconds. That's not slow in the broader scheme of things but slow for the category.    But it's not all doom and gloom: The engine sounds great when pushed, and the RC F is one of the few remaining V8-powered coupes on the market. The RC F's braking performance is also competitive in the sports car class, and the transmission responds quickly to shift requests from the paddle shifters. How comfortable is the RC F? Comfortable front seats and good insulation from the sound of surrounding traffic are highlights, adding to the grand-touring character of the car. The front seats also provide ample bolstering for aggressive driving and have effective heating and ventilation. The adaptive suspension does a good job taking the edge off bigger bumps and making the ride more compliant. It's still firm but it smooths out road imperfections enough to keep it comfortable on long drives.     The climate system's automatic mode works well. The capacitive-touch temperature controls are responsive, if a bit overeager, and manual adjustments are mostly easy. Unfortunately, more in-depth control requires navigating the frustrating infotainment system. How’s the interior? The RC F has a solidly constructed and upscale cabin. Most drivers will find the seating position to be roomy with enough adjustability for both sporty driving and comfort. Getting in and out is much easier than it is in other sports cars because you don't sit so low in the car. There's good visibility toward the front, though the thick rear roof pillars create blind spots.    The back seat is small and nearly unusable by people. Just consider it a storage shelf and you'll be fine. The biggest issue is that the RC F is saddled with one of the worst infotainment interfaces in the industry. Its toucad system is difficult to use, especially while in motion, and some of the menus are confusing to navigate. How’s the tech? The optional Mark Levinson stereo is excellent and provides clear sound that doesn't distort with volume. The infotainment screen is clear and can even display helpful things such as live traffic information. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto phone integration is standard but the integrated voice controls, though they provide a good amount of functionality, are slow to respond and require following correct syntax.    Another area that the Lexus falls distinctly behind is in active driver aids. Adaptive cruise control only works over 25 mph and can't handle stop-and-go traffic. The lane-keeping assist system is weak and loses track of lane lines sometimes. How’s the storage? The RC F's trunk is one of the smallest in the class, and there aren't many options for in-cabin item storage either. The cupholders, a small console box, a small glovebox, and narrow door pockets are all you get. Overall, there's not a lot of room for your stuff in this car. But at least the trunk opening is wide, and the trunk floor is deep and flat, making what space there is more usable.    The rear seats don't fold down, but there is a small pass-through for longer items. Child safety seat installation is a challenge due to the RC F's cramped rear seat room. How’s the fuel economy? The RC F's EPA ratings are average for the segment. Our test car averaged just under 20 mpg on our freeway-heavy test loop, which is a bit under what we expected. In everyday driving in traffic, our average dropped precipitously. Is the RC F a good value? The RC F is priced competitively with the class, though options can add up. It comes with above-average warranty coverage of any of its main competitors, and it's also built as solidly as you expect from a Lexus. Even the plastics are well textured or treated so they don't feel tacky. However, it is also the oldest car in its class and offers the least performance for the money. We want to like this car. The comfy seats and sweet-sounding engine are definite highlights. Plus, the sleek and hunkered-down look is distinctive. But driven aggressively, the RC F is ultimately a little disappointing, and daily driving can seem like a punishment due to the compromised utility, driver aids and infotainment.",V8 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

The five-passenger Transit Crew offers two  seats up front and a second-row three-person bench seat. It's a clever solution  for buyers who want ample cargo space but still need the ability to seat a few  passengers. The Transit Crew is well suited to business use or as the  foundation for a camper or adventure van conversion.  
The  Transit Crew offers a no-frills set of standard features — vinyl  seats and floors, air conditioning and Bluetooth phone connectivity among them  — but it's really the options that make the Crew your own. If  your priorities lean more toward passenger comfort and convenience, you'll find  upgraded infotainment, an 8-inch touchscreen, navigation and cloth upholstery.  There are also multiple custom upfitter packages available for business use. 
The  Transit Crew doesn't skimp on standard safety, and it includes side curtain  airbags, automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning. Other driver  assist tech, such as blind-spot monitoring, parking sensors and adaptive cruise  control, are available options. 
Changes  for 2021 are minor but, of note, the turbodiesel engine has been dropped,  leaving a choice between two V6 engines. Either is robust enough to move the  Transit Crew with authority, although in our test of the similar Transit  Passenger Van, we were disappointed in the EcoBoost turbo V6's fuel efficiency.
You  can get a diesel on some of the Transit's competitors, including the Chevrolet  Express and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. But for an all-around competent commercial  or recreational van with plenty of utility at a reasonable price, the Transit  Crew is a strong pick. Since the Transit Crew doesn't come in traditional tiered trim levels, we don't have one to recommend. Here you basically buy a blank canvas and add options to taste. Your primary decisions start with engine, roof height and body length. If the ability to stand upright in the cabin is important, consider the medium-roof (8.4 feet) or high-roof (9.2 feet) option. And if you plan to tow or regularly haul heavy cargo, you might want to upgrade to the EcoBoost turbo V6 engine.",V6 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 10-speed shiftable automatic

Some cars make you feel like a champion. This one makes you feel like a hero. With its ultra-low-drag styling, aluminum body structure and innovative Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) powertrain, the two-passenger Insight can travel as far as 68 miles on a gallon of gas. Taking into account the car's 10.6-gallon fuel tank, one could theoretically drive from Los Angeles to Salt Lake City and still have a bit of gas in reserve.The heart of the system is a 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine coupled with an electric motor that assists the gasoline engine under acceleration. The package features an idle-stop feature, which shuts off the engine when the driver places the shift lever in neutral and releases the clutch pedal. Unlike GM's all-electric EV1, the Insight requires no external power supply to recharge the 144-volt nickel metal hydride batteries. Regenerative braking via the ABS-assisted disc/drum brakes provides juice to the system. With a full charge and the electric motor providing full assist, the Insight accelerates swiftly, but passing power is lacking.The five-speed manual transmission has relatively short first, second and third gears for good city driving performance, with tall overdrive gearing in fourth and fifth to maximize fuel economy. New this year is a continuously variable transmission (CVT) that requires no gear swapping.Like the Acura NSX's, the Insight's unitized body is made of aluminum (except for the front fenders, which are made from plastic) and boasts a drag coefficient of only 0.25. Thanks to its aerodynamic bodywork, flat underbody, low rolling-resistance tires and extensive use of lightweight materials, the Insight requires 30 percent less power to operate at highway speeds than the previous-generation Honda Civic.But the effort to save weight pays a price in the handling department. The Insight is highly susceptible to crosswinds, and the narrow tires easily track any groove in the pavement, causing the driver to adjust the steering continually to compensate.The Insight's interior is just as futuristic as the exterior, with a sweeping dash and a high-tech LCD analog/digital instrument display. Divided into three sections, the cluster displays engine rpm, coolant temperature and the engine's idiot lights on the left bank; a large digital speedometer, odometer, lifetime fuel economy bar graph and instant fuel economy in the middle; and fuel level, battery level indicator and the electric motor charge and assist indicator on the right bank.Dual high-back bucket seats feature good lateral and lumbar support. Controls for power windows, mirrors, AM/FM cassette stereo, ventilation and available climate controls are all within easy reach, but two large adults might find themselves knocking elbows in the tight cockpit. Built fully equipped (the only option is an automatic air conditioning system) with power windows, door locks, exterior mirrors, an AM/FM cassette stereo, dual airbags, rear window defroster and a whole lot more, the Insight is an incredible value -- for a hybrid vehicle.There are currently just two hybrids for sale: the Insight and the Toyota Prius. The Prius is the more versatile of the two thanks to its backseat.

Minor additions include a special 35th anniversary package and Sebring Silver to the color palette. Camaro is donesville. ""From the country that invented rock 'n' roll"" claimed the advertisements for this Quebec, Canada-built sport coupe when it was last redesigned nearly a decade ago. A small technicality, we suppose, but there are no technicalities when it comes to the Camaro's performance abilities, particularly in Z28 or SS guise. These Camaros are blazingly quick, hold the road tenaciously, cost less than the average price of a new car in this country and get decent gas mileage when they're not being hammered along a twisty two-lane road. Two trim levels are available for 2002 in either coupe or convertible body styles. Base Camaros are powered by a 3800 Series II V6 that makes 200 horsepower. Mated to a four-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission (coupe only), this stout motor makes a strong argument for avoiding the higher insurance rates and prices of the Z28. An optional performance-handling package adds dual exhaust, tighter steering and a limited-slip differential on V6 models. The Z28 is the go-faster Camaro. Equipped with a 5.7-liter LS1 V8, the Z28 is good for 310 horsepower, 50 more than the Mustang GT. Opt for the SS performance package, and you get 325 real horsepower, thanks to forced air induction through an aggressive-looking hood scoop. Chevy says the SS will hit 60 mph in a little over 5 seconds from a stop and continue on to a 13.5-second quarter-mile if you keep the pedal planted -- about as fast as it gets for under $30K. For 2002, revisions are few. Z28 coupes and convertibles get P245/50ZR16 Goodyear Eagle RSA tires as standard equipment, and all V8-equipped models get an auxiliary power steering cooler. Sebring Silver metallic paint has been added to the exterior color palette, while Mystic Teal metallic has been dropped. A special 35th Anniversary edition adds sport stripes, blacked out wheels, and numerous cosmetic add-ons for a one-of-kind look. The interior of the Camaro is functional, but cheap in appearance, and visibility is limited through the sharply raked windshield. The Camaro holds a respectable amount of gear in the cargo hold (more than 33 cubic feet of space with the generally useless rear seats folded down), and airbags and antilock brakes are standard. Chevrolet has officially announced that this will be the last year of Camaro production..

There's also more power on tap from the 4.8- and 5.3-liter engines, increased trailer ratings and standard programmable automatic door locks. New factory appearance items, such as wheel-lip flares and a soft tonneau cover, are now available on some models. If you want power, the Sierra's got it. But if high-quality materials and solid build quality are also a priority, you might want to check the offerings from Ford and Toyota, as well. Thanks to the myriad of improvements that came with the introduction of the '99 Sierra, GMC's full-size pickup now moves to the refinement stage for 2000. Employing unique, three-piece frame construction, Sierras come in either 1500 (half-ton) or 2500 (three-quarter-ton) series.Perhaps the biggest draw for GMC's big pickup is a first-class engine lineup. The base Vortec 4.3-liter V6 has been upgraded this year to improve durability, emissions and fuel economy. It now features a roller timing chain and rocker arms, extended-life spark plugs and coolant and a new oil-level sensor. But more impressive are the three V8s, two of which tout power increases this year thanks to new camshafts. The Vortec 4800 V8 (standard on 1500 Series extended-cab models) makes 270 horsepower (up from last year's 255). And the 5.3-liter V8 gains 15 horses (now at 285) and 10 more pound-feet of torque (to 325). Both engines enjoy a long, flat torque curve for sustained hauling performance. You can also opt for a 6.0-liter V8 with 300 horsepower. Each truck is available with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. As usual, there is a variety of configurations to choose from, including the regular or extended cabs, short or long beds, Wideside or Sportside box designs, two- or four-wheel-drive versions, three trim levels (SL, SLE or SLT) and a dizzying array of options. As a premium truck brand, GMC says it is designing vehicles geared more toward on-road purposes. In other words, if you want a dirt-crunching, rock-hopping vehicle made by GM, Chevy would be the place to shop.For 2000, the roomy extended cabs get a fourth-door for better rear-seat access, and with improved V8 power and a new rating system methodology, all Sierras enjoy higher trailer-towing ratings than last year. Inside, you'll find ample storage areas, including a center armrest that is large enough for a laptop computer or a six-pack of soda, depending on your priorities. Reduced-force airbags (with passenger-side on/off switch) are standard, plus several safety and convenience features have been revamped, including locking and illuminated entry functions.The Sierra boasts far too many features to list here, but suffice it to say that GMC has a very competitive product compared to its Ford and Dodge rivals. But because GMC is set on segmenting itself as the premium truck division that caters to upscale truck buyers, prepare yourself for price creep to start forcing less-affluent young cowboy types to shop elsewhere.",V8 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Audi,audi tt,2014,audi tt 2014,"['Upscale interior', 'standard all-wheel drive', 'good fuel economy.']","[""Performance not as sharp as some competitors'"", 'awkward navigation system interface.']",4.9,"The 2014 Audi TT returns in a single trim level, with a number of former options added to the standard equipment list. The 2014 Audi TT is a fine choice in the personal sporty car realm thanks to its premium feel and avant-garde appearance. But you'll find that competitors in this price range offer more in the way of performance and utility. Ever  since their debut nearly a decade and a half ago, the Audi TT coupe and  convertible have stood out for their very distinctive styling, relatively  sporty performance and weather-beating all-wheel drive. Although the ""wow""  factor of the original TT has faded, the 2014 Audi TT provides all the same core appeal. 
Certainly,  the handsome TT won't be mistaken for anything else on the road. It also scores  points for its well-built and high-quality interior. Under the hood, the base  TT fields a 211-horsepower four-cylinder engine, a six-speed automated manual transmission  and a standard all-wheel-drive system. Performance is certainly sufficient, and  AWD provides some extra wet-weather confidence. But high-performance junkies will  have to place their bets with the souped-up 265- TTS variant (reviewed  separately).
Within  its price range, the TT lags behind the quicker and sharper handling Nissan 370Z or  the V8-powered Chevy Camaro and Ford Mustang. These cars aren't as refined as  the TT, though, nor do they have its premium-image. Still, if these qualities are  important to you, you might find the new BMW 2 Series coupe or 2014  Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class retractable  hardtop roadster more appealing. On the other hand, if you just want a little  bit of everything, the 2014 Audi TT should make for a satisfying choice.  Under  the hood, the 2014 Audi TT sports a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine  that produces 211 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. A six-speed  dual-clutch automated manual transmission and all-wheel drive are both standard.  EPA fuel economy estimates for both coupe and convertible are quite good at 26 mpg  combined (22 mpg city/31 mpg highway). 
In  Edmunds performance testing, a TT Roadster sprinted from zero to 60 mph in 6.3  seconds. That's a reasonable time, but most competing models are quicker.  Standard  safety features on the 2014 Audi TT include traction and stability control, antilock  disc brakes, hill-hold assist, front side airbags (designed to protect the head  and thorax) and front knee airbags. Models equipped with the optional  navigation system also get rear parking sensors.
In  Edmunds brake testing, a TT came to a stop from 60 mph in 111 feet, an average  distance for a car of this type with summer tires. Though  its exhaust note might not stir your soul, the 2014 Audi TT's turbocharged  2.0-liter four-cylinder engine delivers respectable power and performance over a  broad range. The quick-shifting dual-clutch automated manual transmission  helps make the most of that output. Still, 211  isn't much in this segment,  where 300-plus horsepower is more typical. As such, for driving enthusiasts the  TT's acceleration will seem subpar.
Similarly,  the TT's handling is stable and secure, but compared to more focused sports  cars, it doesn't feel as sharp or entertaining on roads with tight turns. This  isn't necessarily a deal breaker for urban commuters, but if driving enjoyment  is a priority for you, you'll find that the 2014 Audi TT has a lower fun factor  than some rivals. Like  other Audis, the 2014 TT offers a handsome interior done up in high-quality  materials. Gauges and controls are easy to see and operate, the main exception  being the navigation system's slightly clunky user interface.
Front  seats are comfortable, and the prominent side bolsters and simulated suede  Alcantara inserts offer good support during enthusiastic driving. The coupe's  rear seats are so small as to be all but useless for passengers, though they  make a fine place to stash briefcases or handbags. The convertible's soft top might  not be as cool as the retractable hardtops on some competitors, but it's hard  to find fault with a multilayer lid that does a good job of sealing out the  elements when it's up and stows in about 15 seconds when it's time for some  open-air motoring.
The  soft top's other advantage over flashier retractable hardtops is that it doesn't  greatly limit cargo capacity when it's down. While the convertible's 8.8 cubic  feet of cargo capacity might not sound like much, it's actually not bad by roadster  standards. That said, the coupe offers greater flexibility by virtue of its  large hatchback opening and 13.1-cubic-foot capacity. If that's not enough,  simply flip the rear seatbacks forward to expand the cargo hold to 24.7 cubic  feet. 
Standard  equipment includes 18-inch wheels, automatic xenon headlights, heated mirrors,  automatic climate control, leather upholstery with simulated suede inserts, eight-way  power front seats (with four-way power lumbar), a tilt-and-telescoping steering  wheel, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, cruise control, Bluetooth and a 12-speaker  Bose surround-sound audio system with a CD player, satellite radio and  auxiliary audio jack. The convertible features a fully powered soft top.
An  optional S Line Competition package adds 19-inch wheels, special exterior and  interior styling and trim details, a sport suspension and upgraded leather  upholstery. The optional navigation system bundles an iPod interface and rear  parking sensors. Heated front seats and special ""Baseball Optic""  leather upholstery are also available.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,all wheel drive , 6-speed automated manual

Revised standard and optional equipment add to the cars' appeal. The big news for this year is the addition of more standard luxuries to this sophisticated autobahn cruiser and, for those with a bent to environmentalism, the declaration that all 7-Series models are now Low Emission Vehicles.  The 7-Series sedans come in three flavors.  Those who must have it all will want to check out the amazingly appointed V12 750iL.  Want a stereo that sounds better than a symphony hall?  Check.  Want an anti-theft security system that can put Fort Knox to shame?  Check.  Want a heated steering wheel?  Check.  Want forty-one inches of rear legroom?  Check.  There weren't many features in the automotive marketplace missing on this car, yet they still managed to add a bunch of new standard equipment this year: Xenon headlights, full body-colored bumpers, five-speed Steptronic automatic transmission, infra-red reflecting windshield (which keeps the car's interior cool), new alloy wheels, car and key memory, ""Brilliant Optics"" dual glass-covered headlamp design, door-mounted puddle lights, full Nappa leather interior, clear lens rear light clusters, twin kidney grille with chrome, and the biggie, the popular On-board Navigation System.  What's not to love (besides the price)?Those on a budget (ha, ha), should take a look at the 740i.  Thirty thousand dollars less than its big brother, the 740i is geared towards buyers who are merely wealthy instead of obscenely rich.  This car has almost everything one could desire, but there are a few items on the option sheet that buyers may want to check out, particularly the brand new Sport Package.  Springing for the package will buy you a five-speed Steptronic automatic transmission, 3.15 rear axle ratio and higher-stall speed torque converter, 18-inch alloy wheels, high performance tires and a sport suspension.Nestled snugly between the 750iL and the 740i is the 740iL.  The 740iL offers all of the space of the 750iL, but leaves enough money in the checking account to send your pride and joy to Stanford for one year.  Many of the styling changes mentioned above that are new to the 750iL can also be found on the 1999 740iL, such as the infra-red reflecting windshield, full body-color bumpers, ""Brilliant Optics"" headlamps and new grille design.The 7-Series' long list of standard and optional features includes an integrated cellular phone, all-season traction control and extra-thick window glass.  Personal safety features include double locked doors, coded drive-away protection, two-step unlocking and the elimination of the passenger door locks; with a car this fine, be prepared for some unwanted attention.It is always difficult to choose the ""best"" in a class of outstanding competitors and, with super-luxury entries from Audi, Mercedes, Jaguar, Lexus and Infiniti, it seems flippant to say that one of these vehicles is superior to the others.  Still, we know which one we would buy if we won Lotto.  BMW has a tradition of improving on excellence and the 1999 7-Series cars are no exception.

Toyota,toyota sequoia,2006,toyota sequoia 2006,"['Refined drivetrain, surprisingly agile handling, versatile and comfortable interior, Toyota reputation for reliability.']","[""Nondescript styling, low towing capacity for a full-size SUV, rear seats don't fold into floor.""]",4.9,"There are no significant changes for the 2006 Toyota Sequoia, though an adoption of new and more accurate SAE engine measuring procedures by Toyota have resulted in a slight drop in the amount of stated power for the V8. The 2006 Toyota Sequoia is a thoroughly capable and comfortable full-size SUV, but if you need to tow a heavy load the competition does it better. Toyota gained most of its following in America by selling small and economical cars. More recently, as its success has grown, the company's selection of products has grown in both variety and size. The Toyota Sequoia SUV was introduced in 2001 as an alternative to the smaller 4Runner and the more lavish Land Cruiser. Built alongside the Tundra pickup in Toyota's plant in Indiana, the full-size Sequoia is the largest sport-utility vehicle in the Toyota lineup. It also happens to be longer and wider than the Tahoe and about the same size as the Expedition. Yep, this is definitely a big truck. The 2006 Toyota Sequoia offers seating for eight, two- or four-wheel drive and a standard V8 engine. It also has plenty of standard and optional features, including a stability control system and a DVD-based rear entertainment system. As another bonus, the Sequoia is backed by Toyota's long-standing reputation for reliability and durability. The main advantage that competitors have over the Sequoia is higher maximum tow ratings, but if this is of no concern to you the Sequoia's ultrarefined drivetrain, great ergonomics, impeccable build quality and high-tech safety features are sure to satisfy. Under the hood is a slightly modified version of the V8 from the Tundra pickup. Displacing 4.7 liters and rated at 273 horsepower and 314 pound-feet of torque, this engine lives up to Toyota's tradition of smooth powertrains that deliver seamless power with minimal apparent effort. Despite the available torque, the Sequoia's maximum towing capacity tops out at 6,500 pounds (6,200 on four-wheel-drive models), less than most of its heavier-duty competition. The 2006 Toyota Sequoia comes standard with stability and traction control, as well as four-wheel antilock disc brakes with EBD and panic assist. Optional are seat-mounted side airbags for front occupants and side curtain airbags for first- and second-row occupants. Besides providing added protection in side impacts, these airbags will also deploy in the event of a rollover. The Sequoia received five out of five stars for driver and front-passenger protection in government frontal-impact testing. Whether on city streets or dirt trails, the 2006 Toyota Sequoia handles well for a full-size SUV, providing both a smooth ride and easy maneuverability around turns. Those hoping for explosive V8 power will be disappointed, but the Sequoia offers fully adequate acceleration and an overall refined demeanor that family buyers will find appealing. Most Toyota Sequoia models seat eight, though opting for the Limited model's luxury package drops capacity to seven. Second-row passengers are given plenty of room, and the 60/40-split bench seat can be reclined, folded or tumbled completely forward. Although there's significantly more third-row legroom than in the Tahoe, the Toyota's narrower body makes three across too close for comfort. Additionally, the Expedition and Armada offer even more leg- and shoulder room, along with the convenience of a fold-flat seat design. Toyota lists maximum cargo capacity at 128.1 cubic feet, but that's with the second-row seats unbolted from the floor (using hand tools). With the second-row seats in use, capacity measures 65.3 cubes. The Toyota Sequoia is available in two trim levels, base SR5 and Limited, with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The SR5 is well equipped with features like 16-inch wheels; power windows, seats, mirrors and locks; a CD and cassette audio system; cruise control; and automatic climate control. Limited models come fully equipped with leather seating, a premium JBL audio system, power sunroof, a multifunction display, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, heated front seats, 17-inch alloy wheels and keyless entry. On both trucks, you can also order options like an in-dash six-disc CD changer, a navigation system, a rear-seat DVD-based entertainment system and a rear load-leveling suspension. A sport package with tubular running boards, a skid plate, load-leveling suspension and various other extras is available on the SR5, while Limited buyers can get a luxury package with second-row bucket seats, electroluminescent gauges, upgraded wood trim and seat memory.",V8 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed automatic

The V8 is powerful even among its sport luxury  competitors, and Audi sedans are known for their well-rounded driving characteristics.

There's  only one trim level, and luckily the S8 comes  well equipped with luxury features.

We feel that this is due to its solid engineering, available saffety features, and fun-to-drive attributes when equipped with a five-speed manual transmisson. The Corolla is a fine car with good handling characteristics, a well-designed interior, and attractive, if not earth-shattering, looks.  Additionally, the optional antilock brakes, better than average crash test scores and integrated child seat go a long way toward making a safe compact family-sedan that is not too expensive.Unfortunately for Toyota, there is a good reason to skip th Corolla when shopping for a new car; the Geo Prizm.  Built on the same assembly line as the Corolla, out of the same parts and by the same workers, the Prizm is everything that the Corolla is and more.

If you're looking for a compact luxury sedan, the IS could be for you, but if  you're seeking more space, consider Lexus' ES and LS sedans for more headroom  and legroom.

The biggest challenge is convenience. If you don't have a charging  station at home, you have to find a public station and wait while your car  recharges. Several automakers are eyeing hydrogen as a gasoline replacement,  and the 2020 Hyundai Nexo is the latest fuel cell vehicle to enter the fray.  The  Hyundai Nexo is a small crossover that slots between the Hyundai Tucson and  Santa Fe in terms of size. The SUV-like layout helps mitigate the cargo storage  issue that limits the appeal of its two main hydrogen-powered competitors, the  Honda Clarity and Toyota Mirai. Both are sedans and lose a lot of cargo space  because of their hydrogen fuel tanks. The Nexo also has an elevated ride height  that might appeal to you if you like SUVs. Our  main issues with Nexo relate more the limitations of the hydrogen network  itself. In our testing of both the Clarity and the Mirai, we've experienced our  share of setbacks that make us question the practicality of a hydrogen car at  this time. The limited number of fueling stations means it's impossible to take  an extended road trip from Los Angeles to anywhere except the Bay Area or San  Diego. We've also seen stations run out of fuel, so you'll have to live near  more than one station in case there's a hiccup in the pipeline. Overall,  we like the Nexo and appreciate its enhanced practicality compared to the  Clarity and Mirai. But the nascent nature of the hydrogen infrastructure limits  the Nexo's appeal to a niche audience. Since  you're already paying a hefty premium for the Nexo's advanced powertrain, it's  worth spending a little extra for the Limited.

Toyota,toyota rav4,1996,toyota rav4 1996,,,4.8,"A new mini-ute based on passenger car mechanicals debuts this year. It's available as a two-door or four-door. The mini-SUV market is booming.  Geo introduced a four-door Tracker this year, Suzuki spruced up the Sidekick with a more powerful engine and body cladding, and Kia dropped a bigger engine and an airbag into its Sportage.  Even the ancient Jeep Cherokee is selling like hotcakes, thanks to its powerful inline six-cylinder engine, low price, and rugged Jeep heritage.Toyota, who in the past half-decade has taken on the luxury-sedan market with Lexus, the full-sized pickup market with the T100, and the traditional full-sized sedan market with the Avalon, now has its sights set on wealth-deprived twenty- and thirty-somethings who want an SUV but can't afford to fork out 25 to 30 grand for a 4Runner.  The RAV4 (Recreational Active Vehicle with 4WD) is a new mini-SUV designed to capitalize on the low end of this booming market.All RAV4s are powered by a 2.0-liter, 120-horsepower engine, hooked to either a five-speed or automatic transmission powering the front or all wheels.  The RAV4 is the first sport utility with front-wheel drive.  All-wheel drive models use powertrain components from the now-defunct Celica All-Trac.  Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional on all models.  Minimum ground clearance is 7.5-inches on the four-door model; two-door RAV4s get an additional .2 inches.  We haven't driven the RAV4, but gave it a close examination at the Arizona Auto Show.  The four-door is comfortable and typically Toyota in materials and design.  Very functional, little flair, and durable in feel and appearance.  The rear seat is a bit cramped for six-footers, but is comfortable enough for short trips.  Fortunately, the split folding rear seat reclines a bit to increase head room.  The cargo area of the four-door is larger than one would expect, offering more room behind the rear seat than a Chevrolet Caprice Classic.  Two-door models are fine for singles or couples without children.  The rear seat is tiny, and less than 10 cubic feet of cargo volume is available with the back seat up.On paper and in person, the RAV4 is a sensible vehicle with loads of personality.  Pricing, as with many Japan-built imports, is this sport ute's main problem.  A 4WD four-door with automatic, ABS, alloy wheels, air conditioning, cruise, cassette and a tilt wheel is gonna run you $21,750.  Add power locks, windows, and mirrors and the price escalates to $22,700.  In contrast, a Kia Sportage EX runs less than $20,000 similarly equipped.  Loaded Trackers and Sidekicks are also less expensive.  Still, the Toyota is bigger inside, cuter outside, and comes standard with Toyota's reputation for quality.  For many buyers, this will be enough to close the sale.  However, we think the Jeep Cherokee is a better value than any of the mini-SUV's on the market, including the RAV4.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Toyota has  upgraded the touchscreen interface to include a lot more features than the  prior system. There's available navigation, more robust voice command  capabilities for many of the car's features and controls (""Hey,  Toyota"" is the prompt), and the ability to receive over-the-air updates  for new features and upgrades. It also supports wireless connectivity for Apple  CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration.
The  Corolla will also come equipped with Toyota Safety Sense 3.0, the latest driver  assistance software suite from the automaker. This is a step forward from the 2022  model, which features the previous generation of the suite. Feature sets are  similar, but Toyota says the system is better at detecting hazards.
Additionally,  the popular LE trim level  now serves as the entry point to the lineup and adds a more powerful standard  engine for 2023. With the arrival of the GR Corolla, Toyota has also  discontinued the Apex Edition versions this year. Fans of manual transmissions  will no longer be able to get one with the Corolla SE trim level either. 
Otherwise,  the 2023 Corolla sedan continues as a solid pick  for a small sedan. In addition to its appealing, easy-to-drive nature, the  Corolla excels in the areas of reliability, efficiency and practicality. But  there are also some more highly rated sedans that are worth considering, such  as the Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra and Mazda 3.  Toyota  hasn't released complete information on the 2023 Corolla as of this writing.  We'll update our recommendation if anything changes, but the LE trim looks to be the sweet spot in  the lineup. It offers a more powerful engine for 2023 and comes with the new  infotainment system and safety features, making it a good value in a compact  car.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,, Continuously variable-speed automatic

It has a low base price, a pleasing level of  standard comfort and safety features, and plenty of comfortable passenger  space. You'll like the look of the interior, especially if it's a QX50 with the  available microsuede headliner and quilted leather seats. There's also a new  infotainment system this year that comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto  smartphone integration. But  take a drive and you'll find that all is not well in QX50 Town. Our main  complaint centers around the turbocharged four-cylinder engine and its  continuously variable automatic transmission. The QX50 is sufficiently powerful  when you floor it, but power delivery in typical driving is maddeningly  nonlinear. In stop-and-go traffic especially, it'll go from low engine  loafing to pin-you-to-the-seat thrust with just a little extra throttle. Then  there's real-world fuel economy — which isn't nearly as good as what  the EPA estimates it to be — and steering that's overly light and  doesn't give you a good sense of the road. Basically,  the QX50 doesn't back up its sporty looks and, if anything, makes the task of  driving harder. Be sure to give the QX50 a thorough test drive in varying  traffic conditions to make sure you can live with it. At the same time, we  recommend checking out other small luxury SUVs that we rate more highly, such  as the Acura RDX, the Mercedes-Benz GLC and the Volvo XC60.What's it like to live with the  QX50?For  a more complete take on the Infiniti QX50 of this generation, check out our  experiences from a full year of living with a 2019 Infiniti QX50  Essential AWD. We cover everything from comfort to performance. Style and  technology were among the highlights, but we took issue with elements of its  performance. The 2020 QX50 gets a new infotainment system with smartphone  integration as well as some new safety features that weren't available on our  2019 long-term test vehicle. One  of the QX50's primary strengths is providing value for the money. As such, we  say go for the Luxe trim level. It  doesn't cost too much more than the base Pure and adds a few items that luxury  SUV shoppers should expect.

These include new fixed HID headlights, freshened front and rear bumpers and updated exhaust tips. Inside, six new color schemes are available. These schemes can be matched to the car's exterior color for a customized look. The center panel has also been updated with new chrome plating. Mechanically, the NSX remains unchanged, though the suspension has been retuned and larger wheels have been fitted. An 11-year-old exotic that still turns heads. Overpriced for what you get, though. Buy a used one and get virtually the same car without the depreciation. Believe it or not, it's been 11 years since Acura introduced this all-aluminum-bodied sports car. Back then, it received well-deserved accolades for its futuristic construction and true sporting design. It still gets our kudos for being well-balanced, highly poised, easy to drive and graceful, even though you can get more horsepower and a relatively similar ride for half the price of other sports cars.Equipped with a 3.2-liter 24-valve V6 engine, the NSX manages 290 horsepower (252 if equipped with the four-speed automatic), which is enough to move the car from 0 to 60 mph in about 5 seconds. The mid-engine design provides excellent weight distribution, keeping the wheels securely planted around turns. Braking is confident, and if driven aggressively, the NSX rewards the driver with capable and entertaining handling.Acura has updated the NSX's exterior this year, giving it fixed headlights, restyled bumpers and 17-inch wheels both front and rear. The restyling is said to improve the car's aerodynamic performance enough to boost the car's top speed from 168 mph to 175 mph. The interior design, though featuring new color schemes this year, looks dated. The NSX is still quite comfortable as exotics go, however. In many ways, it's as easy to drive as its distant relative, the Honda Accord. All controls are logically placed, the seating position is ideal and the targa top is easily stored. While never a strong point of mid-engined exotic sports cars, rear visibility is better than you might expect. The shift action of the six-speed manual transmission thrills us, and the clutch and brake pedals are well placed and provide excellent feedback, as does the razor-sharp steering.Since its 1991 introduction, other sports cars, such as the Dodge Viper and Chevrolet Corvette, have caught up to the radical NSX, and the 'Vette offers more horsepower at half the price. Even the Porsche 911 is a less expensive alternative. An all-new NSX is rumored, but its appearance won't likely happen before 2004.Don't write off the current model, though. It still has plenty to offer. Drivers looking for a supercar that likes being driven at the top end of its tachometer while keeping a leech-like grip on the blacktop couldn't ask for more. And don't forget that the NSX is part of the Acura (Honda) family, which means it won't spend most of its time on a hoist with a man making $90/hour whanging away underneath it, like other exotics. Combine that with its livable interior and excellent ergonomics and you've got a keeper that could be used for daily commutes or joyful driving. Just bring your wallet.",V6 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 4-speed shiftable automatic

Stability control and brake assist have also been added as standard equipment to the SE. A roomy and well-built economy car with surprisingly sharp reflexes, the 2008 Hyundai Elantra is a must-drive if you're shopping for a compact sedan. Every once in a while, a car will really surprise you -- the 2008 Hyundai Elantra is one of those cars. Past Elantras offered a long warranty and a low price, but couldn't really compete with all-star compact sedans like the Honda Civic, Mazda 3 and Toyota Corolla. Now in its second year since a full redesign, the Elantra is the real deal, capable of standing toe-to-toe with the big boys. Plus, it still has that long warranty and low price.Larger than the car it replaced, the supposedly compact Elantra is now considered a midsize sedan by the EPA. (Mind you, the EPA also classifies the Dodge Magnum as an SUV, so take it with a grain of salt.) Still, the Elantra is more spacious overall than its economy car rivals, and Hyundai is quick to point out that it boasts more interior volume than an Acura TL. The backseat is particularly impressive, as its high-mounted bench and generous foot room make it an easy fit for full-size adults.The Elantra's 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine is an old design and isn't as refined as those found in its Japanese competitors, but it's surprisingly responsive and returns pretty good fuel economy. It also runs clean, as it's classified as an Ultra-Low-Emissions Vehicle (ULEV) in most of the country, and a Partial-Zero-Emissions Vehicle (PZEV) in California, Oregon and the Northeast.Once underway, the 2008 Hyundai Elantra continues to impress, with decent steering and handling responses, as well as a smooth ride and a stable demeanor at high speeds. It often feels like a more upscale car than it really is, an impression furthered by the handsome, well-constructed interior. Top-quality plastics and other materials are utilized throughout; however, they are betrayed by some cheap plastics here and there, as well as a leather-wrapped steering wheel (on the SE trim) prone to making your hands feel a bit clammy.As always, there are a multitude of choices in the small economy car segment. Although top-ranked sedans like the Civic may be better known, the 2008 Elantra manages to keep up with them, matching or besting each in a number of different ways. In particular, it's hard to beat the Elantra's level of features, space and quality construction at such a low price. Of course, taking a test-drive of all these choices is recommended, but when it comes time to stop by the Hyundai store, prepare to be pleasantly surprised. The Elantra is front-wheel drive and powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine capable of 138 horsepower and 136 pound-feet of torque. All trim levels can be equipped with either a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic. In California-emissions states, automatic-equipped Elantras are certified as Partial-Zero-Emissions Vehicles (PZEV) and are rated for 132 . Fuel economy for 2008 is a very respectable 24 mpg city and 33 mpg highway regardless of transmission or which state it is sold in.The Elantra is front-wheel drive and powered by a 2.0-liter inline-4 engine capable of 138 horsepower and 136 pound-feet of torque.

Fuel economy for 2008 is a very respectable 24 mpg city and 33 mpg highway regardless of transmission or which state it is sold in. All Elantras come standard with antilock disc brakes, front-seat side airbags, full-length side curtain airbags and anti-whiplash front head restraints. The SE trim level adds standard stability control and brake assist for the ABS. In crash testing conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 2008 Hyundai Elantra earned a top five-star rating in frontal-impact collision protection and a four-star rating for side collisions. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety frontal offset testing, the Elantra received a rating of ""Good,"" the agency's top score. Considering its so-so 138 horses, the 2008 Hyundai Elantra is decently quick out of the gates (zero to 60 mph in 8.4 seconds), especially when equipped with a manual gearbox. The engine suffers from a somewhat coarse demeanor above 3,500 rpm, however. More refined is the ride quality, which is smooth yet stable, even at high speeds, and is one of the Elantra's best attributes. Wind and road noise are also negligible. Although its personality isn't overtly sporting, the Elantra is actually a capable handler. Body roll is moderate, but this Hyundai manages to hold tight through turns, offering plenty of grip and decent steering response. The Elantra's interior quality is quite literally hit or miss. For instance, the dash-top grain and cool blue lighting looks like it could have been removed from an Acura. However, there are a few pieces here and there that wouldn't cut it in a Honda Civic. Still, the overall design is attractive and pleasing, looking as if it belongs in a much more expensive car. Your carpool buddies should be impressed. They'll also appreciate the Elantra's generous amount of space provided by the generous head-, shoulder, hip- and legroom found in both the front and rear seats. Storage is also plentiful, with plenty of cubbies and a 14-cubic-foot trunk. The 2008 Hyundai Elantra is a small sedan available in GLS and SE trim levels. The base GLS is sparsely equipped with 15-inch steel wheels, keyless entry, a 60/40-split folding rear seat, a tilt steering wheel and full power accessories. The GLS Popular Equipment Package adds air-conditioning, foglights, cruise control, vanity mirrors and a six-speaker stereo with CD/MP3 player, auxiliary audio jack and satellite radio. The SE includes this equipment, but adds 16-inch alloy wheels, a trip computer and a tilt-and-telescoping leather-wrapped wheel with audio controls. This year's new SE Premium Package outfits the Elantra with heated seats and a sunroof. (The latter is a stand-alone option on the GLS.) Leather upholstery can also be added to this package.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 5-speed manual 
Ford,ford explorer,1998,ford explorer 1998,"['The Explorer is the best selling sport-ute on the market for a reason.  A comfortable interior, three engine choices, and multiple trim levels mean that there is an Explorer for nearly any budget or lifestyle.']",['Abysmal gas mileage.  Handling is sloppy in corners.'],3.9,"The 1998 Ford Explorer gets a restyled tailgate. Since its introduction in 1991, the Ford Explorer has resided at the top of the sport-utility sales heap.  With good reason. The Explorer combined style, comfort and room in one go-anywhere package. The modern-day Country Squire, some have called it, after the segment leading station wagon of the 1950s. We think that there's a good reason for this.  Simply stated, the Explorer is a more refined vehicle than the competition at Jeep and General Motors.  The interior instills a feeling of quality that is missing from the Grand Cherokee and the Blazer.  An organically sweeping dashboard houses radio controls that can actually be operated without a magnifying glass.  Materials look and feel rich.  Rear seat comfort  surpasses Chevy, and entry/exit is easier than Jeep.  Explorers offer more cargo capacity than most rivals  do, and five passengers can ride with ease.  Exterior styling is a subjective matter, but we think that the Explorer is one of the most attractive SUVs on the road.The Explorer's standard 4.0-liter V6 is one of the weakest engines found in a domestic sport-ute. Acceleration is fine from a standstill, but step on the gas at 50 mph and not much happens.  That's not good news when there's a need to pass or merge.  Fortunately, Ford introduced an optional SOHC V6 in 1997 that offers nearly as much power as the V8, for a lot less money.  We recommend this engine over the other two engine choices due to its great power and affordable price.Changes for 1998 are limited to revising the truck's tailgate.  Nothing to write home about, especially when compared to the sweeping changes of last year, which saw the first-ever application of five-speed transmission technology in a truck.  This five-speed is, in fact, the first ever developed for an American passenger vehicle.  Ford claims that the additional gear, which occurs between the former first and second gears, allows for more precise shifting, allowing the truck to move uphill and off-road more authoritatively.  When combined with the optional SOHC V6, this makes the Explorer much more fun to drive.Unlike the reworked Chevy Blazer, Explorers retain a distinctly truck-like character, which could be a  bonus or a demerit.  They're tough and solid, and easy to maneuver, though steering is a little slow and ponderous and the body leans through tight corners.  Braking is excellent and the suspension has a compliant attitude, but Ford's Explorer can bounce around, making occupants regret the Denver omelet they had for breakfast.Ford has a philosophy of building vehicles that everyone can be happy with.  Sure, the Jeep Grand Cherokee feels sportier, and the GMC Jimmy looks cooler, but the Explorer has just the right amount of class and ruggedness to make it America's best-selling off-roader.  If you are thinking about buying an SUV, chances are you've already checked out the Explorer.  If you haven't, do yourself a favor and find out  why there are so many of these trucks on the road.",V6 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive ,

Bad guys steal them.'],4.5,"Honda redesigns its best-seller for 1998.  A 3.0-liter V6 engine makes its debut in LX V6 and EX V6 models, marking the first six-cylinder VTEC in the Honda lineup. The standard 2.3-liter four-cylinder is also re-engineered, as is the chassis. The 1998 Honda Accord is also larger, and the interior boasts more room inside. The benchmark. The best-selling car in America. The highest resale value in its class. These are all statements that have been made with regularity concerning the Accord. It is always on the short list of the most popular cars in this country. The Accord won a loyal base of customers by offering sprightly performance, room for four, frugal fuel economy and a virtual guarantee that, if cared for properly, the Accord would not break.Those qualities have made it the benchmark. It is consistently the best-selling car to regular retail customers like you.  As for resale, it holds value better than most currency. Sure, the Accord is pretty pricey new, but the overall cost of ownership, when repairs, maintenance, and resale value are put into the equation, make it a bargain.During the 1995 model year, the Accord sedan finally got a V6. However, it doesn't perform as well as some versions four-cylinder Accord. Why? Added weight, different tires and an automatic transmission collaborated to make the Accord V6 slower and less nimble than a five-speed Accord EX. Additionally, critics find that the V6 powertrain was not ideally suited to the Accord, citing smooth but dull response from both the engine and transmission resulting in a bland character; decidedly out of tune with other Honda products.  For '98, Honda pumps that V6 full of VTEC magic, and though we haven't driven it yet, we're hopeful that the first VTEC V6 in the Honda lineup is just what the doctor ordered.The Accord EX equipped with a VTEC engine is quick, frugal, and loaded with equipment. As an added bonus, it's fun to drive. And knowing that, in the end, the Accord will actually cost just half what the sticker reads makes the choice a no-brainer.

While the Jetta isn't quite the bargain it used to be, its sleek looks, spirited demeanor and quality interior materials make it one of our favorite small sedans. The Jetta, Volkswagen's sedan version of the Golf, has always been one of our favorites. Like many cars conceived in Germany, the Jetta possesses an uncanny ability to keep the driver in touch with every undulation and irregularity on the road without sacrificing comfort. The fourth-generation of VW's best-selling Jetta rolled off the line with a completely new wrapper for 1999; this year, buyers will see minor equipment changes. Jetta's entry-level GL model comes with a 2.0-liter, four-cylinder engine that produces 115 horsepower and makes 122 foot-pounds of torque at 2,600 for quick off-the-line acceleration. The GL also has standard side airbags, a cassette stereo, ABS and heated remote mirrors. The next step up the Jetta ladder is the GLS trim level, which can be ordered with an optional V6 powertrain, and offers more standard goodies like cruise control, power windows and mirrors, and a center armrest. The big news for 2000 is the availability of a turbocharged 1.8-liter four in GLS trim. Known as the 1.8T, this engine makes 150 horsepower and feels spunky throughout the range -- better yet, it costs less than the V6. Additionally, a Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine is optional on the GL and GLS models. When mated to a manual transmission, the TDI will achieve approximately 49 mpg. The top-of-the-line Jetta GLX gets you that buttery-smooth, 174-horsepower VR6 engine standard and provides nifty equipment like rain-sensor wipers, automatic climate control, leather seats, self-dimming rearview mirrors and wood trim. For 2000, Jetta buyers will receive cars with a brake-wear indicator, a sliding sun-visor extension, and an optional (dealer-installed) dashboard CD player. The cold-weather package, eight-speaker stereo system and 16-inch alloy wheels (VR6 only), which are standard on the GLX, are now optional on the GLS model. The car's exterior is sleek and curvaceous, with big bumpers and wheel arches that house 15-inch wheels. Built with high-tech bonding agents and laser-welding techniques, the Jetta is structurally rigid, which makes for crisp handling and better control. The Jetta has always been a driver's car, providing an enjoyable experience with a modified MacPherson front-suspension strut concept that has more positive caster and a perfected strut layout for improved directional stability. An enhanced track-correcting torsion-beam rear axle, larger stabilizer bars and four-wheel disc brakes with ABS are also standard. Due to its popularity and subsequent price increases, the Jetta is not quite the bargain it used to be. Still, Volkswagen's bread-and-butter sedan competes well with contenders like the Dodge Stratus, Ford Contour and Honda Accord, and the top-level GLX model undercuts other V6-powered German and Japanese sedans by thousands. Plus, with the introduction of the 1.8T engine to the lineup, you can essentially build yourself an entry-level Audi A4 surrogate.

The 2013 Honda Ridgeline doesn't have the muscle that serious truck buyers demand, but its combination of a carlike ride and pickup utility makes it all the pickup many buyers will ever need. If you're using a pickup for a trade or serious towing, then  a conventional pickup still is the way to go. But if you only occasionally  require the utility of a pickup, the 2013 Honda Ridgeline is worth considering. 
There are plenty of full-size pickups with beds barely  longer than the 2013 Honda Ridgeline's 5-foot box and with the same 50-inch  width, so the Ridgeline's no less capable as a cargo hauler than many  run-of-the-mill crew cab battlewagons. At the same time, it gives you a much  more manageable footprint. And while you still enjoy a high-set seating  position and admirable ground clearance, the Ridgeline's fully independent  suspension and lighter, car-based structure make it more nimble than most  conventional pickups.
Honda  keeps the Ridgeline simple with a single four-door body style, one engine and  an all-wheel-drive system for all models. The 2013 Ridgeline's cabin is wide  and spacious and loaded with versatility for cargo and passengers. But for the  higher driving position, you could be in any number of Honda's cars or  crossovers -- if they also had the bed out back, handy in-floor storage locker  and a tailgate that swings or drops down traditional-pickup style.
The Ridgeline has some notable drawbacks, though. Its  lighter-duty suspension and structure makes it more of an urban hauler that  gets you through difficult weather or mild off-pavement excursions than a true  off-roader. The Ridgeline's V6 power also falls short of the V8s or  turbocharged V6s in full-size domestic pickups, and its fuel economy isn't so  great, either.
If you need a pickup but can't sacrifice standard pickup  toughness, stick with similar-sized conventional pickups such as the Nissan Frontier  or 2013 Toyota Tacoma. Both offer more body  styles and heavier-duty undercarriages. But the Ridgeline and its all-around  versatility might be best thought of as an alternative to midsize crossovers  useful in so many suburban households. The 2013 Honda Ridgeline offers only a 3.5-liter V6  generating 250 horsepower and 247 pound-feet of torque. Power flows through a  five-speed automatic transmission and a standard all-wheel-drive system,  although in normal driving power is sent almost exclusively to the front wheels.  The system can be locked in all-wheel-drive mode at speeds up to 18 mph. In  Edmunds testing, the Ridgeline accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 8.3 seconds,  a little slower than most competing trucks.
EPA estimated fuel economy is 15 mpg city/21 mpg highway and  17 mpg combined -- mediocre considering the Ridgeline V6's modest power and  performance. Some full-size traditional pickups with more powerful V6s are  rated better. On the bright side, the Ridgeline can tow up to 5,000 pounds, a  limit similar to some V6-powered full-size pickups. The Ridgeline's payload and  towing capacity is less than many V6 midsize pickups equipped with trailer-tow  packages, however. Every Ridgeline comes standard with antilock brakes,  stability control, front seat side airbags, side curtain airbags (with rollover  sensor) and front seat active head restraints.
In Insurance Institute for Highway  Safety tests, the Ridgeline received the organization's highest ""Good""  rating in frontal-offset and side-impact crashes, as well as for roof-strength  testing. In Edmunds testing, the Ridgeline required 133 feet to stop from 60  mph, a little long for a midsize pickup. The 2013 Ridgeline's carlike independent suspension delivers  a smooth and quiet ride compared to conventional pickups and handling is more  responsive, too. The Ridgeline's 3.5-liter V6's output is sufficient, but the  truck's excessive weight, coupled with an automatic transmission with just five  gears, means disappointing fuel economy for a truck that should have more of an  advantage in its class.  The 2013 Honda  Ridgeline's cabin is wide, as are its seats, and entry into the front or rear  seats is easy, something we can't always say about the rear seat of  conventional midsize pickups. The gauges are large and easy to read, and major  and secondary controls are operated by large stalks and knobs suitable for gloved  hands. Secondary controls for the audio and climate-control systems are simple  and functional, perhaps reflecting the overall age of the Ridgeline's interior  design. Another tipoff to the relative age of the truck's infotainment  architecture: Bluetooth hands-free phone control, often standard on even the  most modest of new models, is optional. And even then, you'll have to first buy  the RTL trim level to get it.
But the Ridgeline's  car-type structure lends a more comfortable and nicely trimmed interior than  you'll find on most competing pickups. Handy and capacious storage  spaces and cupholders abound. The 60/40-split rear seat folds to make room for  large items that won't fit in the bed's 8.5-cubic-foot lockable stowage area,  although it is capable of holding a bag or two of golf clubs. The lockable  trunk's drain plugs allow for all manner of potentially sloppy uses, but  anything in there might have to be removed if you need access to the spare tire  under the bed floor. 
The entry-level RT is well-equipped with standard features including  17-inch steel wheels, a power-sliding rear window, air-conditioning, a  60/40-split-folding rear seat (with under-seat storage), a rearview camera, full  power accessories, cruise control, a trip computer and a six-speaker sound  system with a CD player.
The Sport adds 18-inch alloy wheels, rear privacy glass,  foglights, special exterior trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and an  auxiliary audio jack.
To the RT's features list, the RTS adds 17-inch alloy  wheels, rear privacy glass, dual-zone automatic climate control, an eight-way  power driver seat and an upgraded seven-speaker audio system with a six-CD  changer. The top-level RTL gets 18-inch alloy wheels, foglights, a sunroof,  leather upholstery, ambient console lighting, heated front seats, a 115-volt AC  power outlet and satellite radio.
The Ridgeline's factory options list is limited to a navigation  system with Bluetooth, and is only available for the RTL.",V6 cylinder ,,,four wheel drive , 5-speed automatic 
Honda,honda accord,1999,honda accord 1999,"['Good build-quality, spacious interior, peppy engine, and comfortable seats.  We call it intelligent engineering.']",['Popularity.  Bad guys steal them.'],4.6,"For the 1999 Honda Accord, coupes remain unchanged after their recent overhaul, but the sedans receive new seat fabric, and the LX and EX sedans now feature fold-away side mirrors. The benchmark.  The best-selling car in America.  The highest resale value in its class.  These are all statements that have been made with regularity concerning the Honda Accord, a vehicle that is always on the short list of the most popular cars in this country.  The Accord won a loyal base of customers by offering sprightly performance, room for four, frugal fuel economy and a virtual guarantee that, if cared for properly, the Accord would not break.  Totally redesigned last year, the Accord is still a raging bargain.  The sixth generation Accord is available in new coupe and sedan bodies.  A 3.0-liter V6 engine makes its debut in LX and EX models, marking the first six-cylinder VTEC in the Honda lineup.  The standard 2.3-liter four-banger is also re-engineered, as is the chassis.  And the new interior design creates more room inside than any of Accord's competitors.However, the low price is accompanied by a low level of equipment.  Fortunately what is included in the base price is good stuff.  The seats are comfortable, front and rear.  There is an immense amount of storage and passenger space inside the car.  Ergonomics are nearly flawless. The 200-horsepower 3.0-liter SOHC VTEC V6 is a model of refinement, revving smoothly and silently.  Braking and handling are good, the transmission shifts smoothly, and the steering is light and effortless.  The car is easy to drive, but doesn't reward the driver much for your efforts.  Body roll is excessive and the tires fold over at the first available opportunity when running the Accord along a curvy road.  The verdict?  Fast, but not much fun. A Japanese Buick Regal but with a somewhat choppy highway ride.As with the Toyota Camry, refinement and attention to detail are the Accord's strengths.  Almost all interior materials are pleasing to the eye and touch, and are assembled with great care.  Gap tolerances are about half what you'd find in American products.  Storage room abounds; the Accord resembles a minivan with so many places to stash maps, drinks, change, and assorted detritus.  Spacious, comfortable and quiet, the Accord will tote many happy campers for miles on end. While not exactly spicy, the Honda Accord is a quality, fine-tuned car exhibiting remarkable design because it is so functional and user friendly.  The bottom line is that Honda builds the ultimate midsize car.  A low price, a high level of refinement, a cavernous interior, and a well-deserved reputation for reliability put the Accord at the top of the heap.  Even a loaded EX model with leather, alloy wheels, power moonroof, automatic climate control, CD player, premium sound, and steering wheel radio controls stickers for less than $25,000.  The Accord is the definitive family sedan or coupe, and it's the benchmark by which all other midsize cars are measured.",V6 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Honda,honda odyssey,1996,honda odyssey 1996,,,4.8,"Minivan-wagon hybrid carries into 1996 sans changes. With its doors open and beckoning, Honda's stylish and competent family hauler resembles a tall station wagon more than a minivan.  Why?  Because instead of the expected sliding side door--a staple of minivan design from the start--you find that all four side doors swing open, like those in a sedan.  They contain roll-down windows, too.  Naturally, Honda hopes that this unique attribute will help steal sales away from the competition, but a single special feature isn't enough to ensure success in the ferocious minivan market.Fortunately for Honda, Odysseys possess other virtues.  For starters, you get plenty of room for four or five, with a spacious center section that's exceptionally easy to enter.  Either bucket seats or a three-place bench can go there. Not enough? Well, a handy two-passenger bench seat pops out of the cargo floor to expand passenger capacity to seven.  That back bench folds flat very easily when cargo is the priority, and an inside-mounted, compact spare tire takes up very little space.The driver occupies a comfortable position, ahead of a low cowl and steering wheel, and a severely sloped windshield, its base stretched far forward.  Small front quarter windows do little for visibility in that direction, but mirrors are very good.  An unusual slanted dashboard holds a distinctive speedometer.  In addition to a large glovebox and ample console storage box, the Odyssey offers a smaller supplementary glovebox.  On the safety front, airbags are installed for both the driver and front passenger.  So is all-disc antilock braking.Power comes from a VTEC 140-horsepower, 2.2-liter 16-valve four-cylinder engine, borrowed from the Accord.  Adequately brisk performance is accompanied, unfortunately, by an excess of buzziness. If noise is a drawback for you, a V6 choice is likely to arrive soon.  Engines in both the LX and EX editions drive an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission, complete with a Grade Logic Control System and controlled by a column-mounted gearshift lever.  Both Japanese-built models are well-equipped, priced competitively, and carry on Honda's reputation for solid construction.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Trek gets alloy wheels. GL, GLS, Trek and GT run more quietly, thanks to a new cylinder head design. Volkswagen's sedan version of the Golf, the Jetta, has always been one of our favorite sedans.  Like most cars conceived in Germany, the Jetta has an uncanny ability to keep the driver in touch with every undulation and irregularity in the road without sacrificing comfort.  It has a cavernous interior, logically laid-out controls and displays, and zippy performance.GL, GLS, Trek, and new-for-1997 JAZZ and GT offer enough oomph to keep most drivers satisfied, when equipped with a five-speed transmission.  The optional automatic saps what little power the Jetta has to offer, and we don't recommend it.  Most drivers who want a Jetta will be of the persuasion that eschews the autobox in favor of rowing their own gears anyway because, let's face it, why buy a VW if you don't enjoy driving?Driving enjoyment is what the top-of-the-line GLX is all about.  Sporting a powerful and compact V6 engine, thick alloy wheels, and newly lowered sport suspension, the GLX is a poor man's BMW 325i.  If you have a need for speed, this is the Jetta to buy, but prepare to endure a sore backside.  The granite-like side bolsters of the seat cushion are excruciatingly uncomfortable.This year, Jettas equipped with the 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine run quieter thanks to a redesigned cylinder head.  The new GT model gives buyers the look of the GLX without the cost of the go-fast powertrain, providing drivers with a sporty yet economical sedan with alloy wheels, decklid spoiler, and optional ABS.  Trek models return midyear with alloy wheels and GT styling cues, but no optional ABS.  Mid-year, the JAZZ was introduced with alloy wheels, standard six-disc CD changer, and upgraded trim.  A Turbo Direct Injection (TDI) model has been expected in showrooms for more than a year, but quality glitches have kept it off the market.  VW says the car will arrive imminently and claims this car will change the way you think of diesels, touting how quick, quiet and clean it is.  We don't think Americans will be interested.Regular Jettas are a blast once they're moving.  Sharp steering response, a taut chassis, and a superb driving position combine to make you forget about the wimpy 2.0-liter, 115-horsepower engine under the hood.     Reliability has been a problem with Volkswagens in the past.  Current Jettas come with a 10-year/100,000-mile warranty that backs up the powertrain, and free roadside assistance is provided for the first two years of ownership.Not that you couldn't afford to fix it once in a while. The sporty midlevel GT, loaded with anti-lock brakes, power sunroof, CD changer, and a fun-robbing automatic transmission, doesn't crack the $20,000 barrier.  Prices like these make the Jetta very competitive with the Dodge Stratus, Ford Contour, and Honda Accord.  The GLX undercuts premium German sedans by thousands of dollars, without sacrificing performance, features or that Teutonic feel.

Toyota,toyota 4runner,2014,toyota 4runner 2014,"['Outstanding off-road capability', 'strong V6 engine', 'ample cargo capacity.']","['Lack of V8 or diesel engine option limits towing capacity', 'busy ride', 'poor fuel-economy', 'cramped third-row seat', 'cumbersome setup process for Entune system.']",4.5,"The 2014 Toyota 4Runner has revised exterior styling, new headlights and a revamped interior. A touchscreen-based audio system and Toyota's Entune suite of smartphone-connected apps are standard for all trim levels, as is a rearview camera. There are also minor changes in standard equipment. For the relatively few drivers who require an all-conquering all-terrain SUV, the 2014 Toyota 4Runner is a top choice. If  your lifestyle necessitates a vehicle with genuine off-road capability (or  heck, you just prefer your daily ride to be ready for anything), Toyota's got  you covered with the 2014 4Runner. It's one of the few remaining midsize SUVs  on the market that embodies the term ""sport-utility vehicle"" to the  fullest extent as opposed to just looking the part.
You  can still bang around off-road with the 2014 Toyota 4Runner because it employs  the same rugged body-on-frame architecture that underpins pickup trucks. And  that, along with plenty of suspension travel and protective underbody plates,  helps keep things from breaking when used as intended. The 4Runner's  four-wheel-drive system also has low-range gearing and an available locking  rear differential to help see you through rough terrain, deep snow or whatever  else you want to throw its way.
Of  course, there are plenty of consumers who enjoy the Toyota 4Runner's  traditionalist image, but mainly use it for commuting to work and running  errands with the kids. In a nod to that reality, Toyota has made some changes to the  4Runner this year. The SR5 and Trail models feature upgraded interior materials  and all models get a new instrument panel and a touchscreen audio interface  with smartphone integration via the automaker's Entune system (although we've  found Entune to be a mixed bag when it's actually time to use it). A rearview  camera -- an invaluable safety feature on any SUV -- is standard across the  board for 2014, while Limited models now allow you to bask in the comforts of  heated and ventilated front seats. And although the optional third-row seat is  not very roomy, the 4Runner continues to offer it, providing seven-passenger  capacity in a pinch.
That  third-row seat, along with high cargo capacity, is one of the 2014 4Runner's  few advantages over its closest rival, the Jeep Grand Cherokee,  which seats only five. Otherwise, though, we think the Jeep offers a better  compromise between off-road capability and on-road comfort. Plus, it's  available with a fuel-efficient diesel engine (not to mention a couple of V8s)  -- whereas the Toyota is V6 only -- and comes with a great deal more high-end  tech and safety features.
Meanwhile,  buyers wanting a true SUV with a third row they can use every day will likely  find the somewhat larger Dodge Durango more spacious and  comfortable. For those who can spend a bit more, the Volkswagen Touareg  offers premium interior accommodations, along with a strong lineup of engines  (including a diesel) and a high tow rating for a midsize SUV. And if you don't  require much off-pavement ability at all, there are numerous car-based  crossover SUVs like the 2014 Chevrolet Traverse and the 2014 Toyota Highlander that  will meet your needs. They'll also provide a softer, more carlike ride, lower  step-in height and better fuel economy. 
All  that said, the choices for a modestly sized and (relatively) modestly priced  genuine SUV seem to be narrowing every year, and the 2014 Toyota 4Runner  remains a likable option in this cadre. The  2014 Toyota 4Runner comes standard with a 4.0-liter V6 engine that produces 270  horsepower and 278 pound-feet of torque. A five-speed automatic transmission is  also standard. The SR5 and Limited models are available with either rear-wheel  drive or four-wheel drive, while the Trail is 4WD only. 
Four-wheel-drive  SR5 models have a part-time four-wheel-drive system with a low-range transfer  case, while the Limited uses a full-time 4WD system with low-range gearing and  an independently lockable center differential. The Trail model comes standard  with the part-time 4WD system and also includes a locking rear differential,  crawl control (for use in low range) and selectable electronic  terrain-sensitive systems. Properly equipped, the 4Runner is rated to tow up to  4,700 pounds.
In  Edmunds testing, a rear-drive 4Runner SR5 accelerated from a standstill to 60  mph in 7.2 seconds (7.8 seconds for a four-wheel-drive Trail model), which is  about average among competing SUVs. The EPA estimates fuel economy at 19 mpg  combined (17 mpg city/22 mpg highway) for rear-wheel-drive models and 18 mpg  combined (17 mpg city/21 mpg highway) for four-wheel-drive 4Runners  (regardless of which 4WD your vehicle has) -- slightly below average for a  midsize, off-road-oriented SUV with a gas-powered six-cylinder engine. Standard  safety features on the 2014 Toyota 4Runner include antilock disc brakes,  stability and traction control, front seat side airbags, full-length side  curtain airbags, front knee airbags and active front head restraints. All 4WD  models feature an off-road traction control system known as A-TRAC that helps  keep you moving on slippery terrain by redirecting engine torque to the  wheel(s) that have traction. A rearview camera is standard across the board.  The Limited comes with the Safety  Connect emergency communications system, which includes automatic collision  notification, a stolen-vehicle locator and roadside assistance.
In  Edmunds brake testing, a rear-wheel-drive 4Runner SR5 came to a stop from 60  mph in 122 feet, which is average among SUVs in its class. A Trail model with  its off-road-oriented tires needed a longer 132 feet to come to a standstill.
In  government crash tests, the 4Runner earned an overall rating  of four stars (out of a possible five) along with four stars in frontal  crash protection and five stars in side-impact protection. The Insurance  Institute for Highway Safety awarded the 4Runner its top rating  of ""Good"" in the moderate-overlap frontal-offset, side-impact and  roof-strength crash tests. Its seat/head restraint design also rates  ""Good"" for whiplash protection in rear-impact crashes.  Unlike  most of today's midsize SUVs, the 2014 Toyota 4Runner is designed to provide  real utility when the pavement ends. This Toyota is at its best when you're  plugging along on off-road trails -- the Trail with optional KDSS is the  version you'll want for these adventures. At the same time, the 4Runner has  enough refinement that you can simply drive it to work every day, if that's  your preference. This is still a SUV in the traditional mold, however, and  compared to modern crossover SUVs you'll feel a lot more of the bumps and ruts  in the road. Toyota's steering feels a little too light and overboosted in normal  driving situations, but this calibration turns out to be ideal for off-roading,  as it results in reduced kickback on gnarly trails.
The  Toyota 4Runner's smooth V6 engine is strong enough that only consumers planning  to tow a trailer will lament the lack of a V8 option. Still, there's  no denying that you'd get more pulling power and better fuel economy with the  optional diesel engines on rivals like the Grand Cherokee and Touareg. The  4Runner's five-speed automatic transmission provides well-timed shifts, but we  certainly wouldn't mind another gear to calm the engine on the highway and eke  out another mpg or two.  One  of the changes you'll notice immediately in the 2014 Toyota 4Runner interior is  the new instrument panel. In place of the old individual gauge binnacles, the  new design locates an oversized speedometer and tachometer on either side of a  multifunction screen trip computer. The new gauges are attractive and easy to read,  and a welcome upgrade over the previous design.
In  addition, all 2014 4Runners come with a touchscreen audio interface placed high  on the center stack. Depending on which trim level you've selected, it brings  various degrees of functionality from Toyota's Entune suite of  smartphone-enabled services and apps (among them, Pandora Internet radio, the Bing search engine and sports/stock info  updates). The SR5/Trail Premium models and the Limited integrate a navigation  system into this interface. Getting started with  Entune can be a hassle, though, since you have to install an app on your phone  and register for an account; plus, you always need an active data connection to  use it. The touchscreen interface has straightforward menus, but it's sometimes  unresponsive to touch.
Most  owners will be satisfied with the quality of the 4Runner's cabin materials,  which are oriented more toward durability than aesthetics. Although you won't  be afraid to get the Toyota's interior dirty, there's no denying that it has a  more workaday ambience than, say, the interior of the Jeep Grand Cherokee.
As  for passenger accommodations, the standard five-person seating arrangement  includes a reclining 40/20/40-split-folding second-row seat. The  optional third-row seat is bound to be a tempting option for carpoolers (as it  provides seating for seven), but you'll want to make sure your elementary  schoolers will actually fit, as this is one of the smallest, tightest third  rows of any midsize SUV.
Most  buyers will find that this space is better used for cargo. There's a healthy 47  cubic feet of cargo room behind the second-row seats, a number that jumps to an  even healthier 89.7 cubic feet with all the rear seats folded down. This is far  more space than the Grand Cherokee offers and more than many large crossovers  (such as the Ford Explorer and Honda Pilot) as well. 
The  SR5 comes standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, skid plates, a tow hitch, hill  start assist and hill descent control, a rearview camera, foglights, heated  exterior mirrors, rear privacy glass, a power-lowering liftgate window, a  windshield wiper de-icer, keyless entry, cruise control, air-conditioning with  second-row vents, cloth upholstery, a six-way power driver seat, a  leather-wrapped steering wheel with tilt/telescope adjustment, and  40/20/40-split-folding and reclining rear seats. On the electronics side, it  comes with Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity and an eight-speaker audio system with a  touchscreen interface, the Entune suite of smartphone-connected apps, a CD player, satellite radio, an auxiliary  audio jack and an iPod/USB audio interface.
The  SR5 Premium model adds a sunroof and outside mirrors with integrated turn  signals and puddle lamps. Inside, you get Toyota's SofTex premium vinyl  upholstery, heated front seats, a four-way power front passenger seat, a  navigation system and an upgraded version of Entune with voice control,  phonebook-download capability and text-to-speech messaging for enabled phones.
The  4Runner Trail model includes all of the base SR5's standard features and adds  off-road-oriented all-season tires, mudguards, body-color exterior trim,  special components and electronic aids for off-road capability and an eight-way  power driver seat. The Trail Premium model adds the sunroof and all of the  interior amenities and electronics you get on the SR5 Premium. Either 4Runner  Trail model can be equipped with the optional Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System  (KDSS). This option is aimed at serious outdoor enthusiasts, as KDSS  automatically disconnects the SUV's stabilizer bars in low-speed off-road  situations to improve suspension articulation over deep ruts and boulders.
The  2014 4Runner Limited includes all of the Trail Premium's standard content,  except for the off-road-related equipment. It also comes standard with 20-inch  alloy wheels, adaptive shock absorbers for the suspension, automatic  headlights, keyless ignition/entry, dual-zone automatic climate control,  perforated leather upholstery, heated front seats and ventilation for the  driver seat, and an upgraded JBL sound system with 15 speakers and HD radio.
Many  of the features found on the 4Runner Trail and Limited models are available as  options on the lower trim levels, though specifics will vary based on the  region of the United States in which you live. Other options include fixed  running boards for the SR5 and Trail, automatically deploying/retracting  running boards for the Limited, a sliding rear cargo floor and roof-rack crossbars.",V6 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed shiftable automatic

This is a perfect way to spend that new raise.'],['Cheap plastic buttons for the power door lock switches are out of place in a car of this caliber.'],4.7,"Side-impact airbags are now available for rear-seat passengers, as is break-resistant glass for the windows and moonroof. BMW redesigned their 5-Series line of sedans in 1996 and introduced them as a 1997 model.  No significant changes have occurred for the 1998 model year, but side-impact airbags are now available for rear-seat passengers, as is break-resistant glass for the windows and moonroof.BMWs are famous for the suppleness of their ride and the responsiveness of their steering; firmness without harshness is the phrase most often bandied about our offices when discussing these cars' uncanny ability to stay connected to the road while communicating almost telepathically with the driver.  The 5-Series is no exception.  Breakthrough, all-aluminum suspensions on six- and eight-cylinder models reduce the vehicles' unsprung weight by 46 pounds; better allowing these cars to respond to irregularities in the road. Variable-ratio, variable-assist rack-and-pinion steering, borrowed from the M3, finds its way into the 528i.  The variable-ratio steering results in a ratio that increases exponentially as the wheel is moved towards the locks; thus allowing safe, effortless high-speed correction and easy low-speed maneuvering. The 540i makes do with recirculating ball variable-assist power steering, a similar to the setup found on the 7-Series sedans.The biggest news for the 5-series, of course, is found under the hood.  The entry-level 5-Series has an inline six-cylinder engine that provides excellent midrange torque.  The 540i gets a more powerful 4.4-liter V8 that offers zero to 60 times in the low-sixes.  The 528i comes standard with a five-speed manual transmission and is also available with a sophisticated four-speed automatic.  Equipped with BMW's Adaptive Transmission Control, the four-speed tracks the driver's driving style and road conditions; allowing the shift timing to adjust accordingly.  The 540i models continue to be available with a five-speed automatic or a six-speed manual transmission.  Opt for the six-speed manual and prepare yourself for an invigorating ride; the suspension is firmed up noticeably on this lively model.As one would expect in a top-end, luxury-sport sedan, equipment levels are first-rate.  Safety equipment includes four-wheel antilock disc brakes, traction control, nine-mph bumpers, dual airbags, side-impact airbags, optional rear passenger side-impact airbags, three-point seatbelts at all seating positions, impact sensors that unlock the doors and activate the hazard lights in the event of a serious accident, remote keyless entry, two-step unlocking, coded driveaway protection and a vehicle security system.  To list all of the 5-Series' luxury features would take more space than we have; a few of the more  noticeable ones are automatic climate controls, power moonroof (540i) or sunroof (528i), 200-watt stereo, 10-way power front seats with power headrests, heated outside mirrors, heated steering wheel and a right-hand outside mirror that tilts down when the car is in reverse to help drivers see curbs when parallel parking.Yes indeed, the new 5-Series is a wonderful car.  Given all of the inquiries we receive about it, you apparently think so too.  If you can afford to buy one, we recommend that you do.  Sure there are other great cars out there in this price range; we just think that this one's the best.  Good luck, safe driving, have fun; we're sure you'll love it.",V8 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive ,

Horsepower has been increased, and a six-speed manual transmission is now optional on the Miata LS. Both the exterior and interior have been updated and there are four new exterior colors. Regular Miatas now have 15-inch wheels as standard equipment, while both the Miata LS and cars equipped with the optional suspension package get 16-inch wheels. Safety and security are improved via seatbelt pre-tensioners, improved ABS, an engine immobilizer, an internal trunk release and optional keyless remote (standard on Miata LS). As much fun as you can have while driving with your pants on. Financially, it certainly pays to buy in bulk. To own a big-and-bad Ford Excursion, you'll have to pay only about $5 per pound (based on MSRP for a base model). To own a lithe 2001 Mazda Miata, you'll have to pay close to $9 per pound. But hey, sometimes you just have to pay more to get the good stuff. While it seems strange to pay over $20,000 for a Miata, the price is still considerably less than those asked for roadsters like the BMW Z3, Mercedes-Benz SLK, Porsche Boxster, and Honda S2000. And while the Miata might not be able to match these cars' absolute performance numbers, it certainly equals or exceeds them with regard to the intangibles. The Miata is about simplicity in design and operation. It's about having fun behind the wheel. It's about feeling free and young on warm summer nights. Not a serious car, the Miata, but that's part of its charm. For 2001, the Miata receives its most thorough updating since its redesign in 1999. The exterior gains new headlights, a restyled front bumper and fascia, a new five-point air inlet, and an improved boot cover. Mazda has added variable valve timing to the 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, bumping horsepower to 155 at 7,000 and torque to 125 foot-pounds at 5,000 rpm. The six-speed manual transmission, previously available only on a couple of special limited edition models, is now an option on the Miata LS. Equipped with the six-speed transmission, a 2001 Miata LS should be the fastest Miata ever.Though the Miata's trunk is miniscule when compared to what can be crammed into the latest SUVs, it can handle daily commuting or weekend getaways. The shifter moves with quick and short precision and all of the switchgear is easy to reach and use. For 2001, the interior features new white-faced gauges with chrome rings, new seats, new interior materials, revised positions for the cupholder and power door-lock switch, and a new modular audio system. Droning trips on American interstates are not the Miata's forte. But with a lowered top and an open road, the Miata has few equals. The engine is perfectly matched to the suspension and steering, making the car a joy to pilot on curving roads. When equipped with the suspension package (which includes items like a Torsen limited-slip differential and upgraded shock absorbers), the Miata's performance envelope is wider, but some fun is lost in not being able to adjust the tail easily via the throttle. In our opinion, you can utilize 90 percent of the Miata's abilities under normal driving conditions, while a Porsche Boxster driver is lucky to experience 60 percent of that car's potential most of the time. Toyota will give the '01 Miata some tough competition with its new MR2 Spyder, but that won't change the fact that the Miata continues to be one of the best roadsters available today.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

The most noticeable is the addition of the 2WD Limited to the model lineup. SR5 models receive new interior fabrics. After a successful five-year run, the second-generation Toyota 4Runner has been retired, and not a moment too soon.  Fresh in 1990, the 4Runner aged quickly as the sport utility market exploded and other automakers introduced larger, safer and more powerful rivals.  By 1995, the compact pickup-based 4Runner offered little, other than Toyota's reputation for reliability, to entice buyers.For 1996, Toyota has separated this high-volume SUV from its pickup truck roots.  The new 4Runner shares little with the Tacoma pickup.  As a result, engineers have created a more refined vehicle without sacrificing tough off-road ability.  Suspension travel and tread width are both up to improve off-road ability, ride, and handling.  The interior is larger in every direction, thanks to a wheelbase that is two inches longer than the previous version.  A lower floor and wider doors make getting into and out of the 4Runner less of an exercise in contortionism.  Rear leg room is up by three inches, and cargo space has been improved as well.Two engines are available on the 4Runner; a 2.7-liter inline four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower at 4800 and 177 foot-pounds of torque at 4000 rpm., and a 3.4-liter V6 producing 183 horsepower at 4800 and 217 foot-pounds of torque at 3600 rpm.  These figures represent a substantial improvement over the old anemic four cylinder and wheezy V6 -- in fact, the new 2.7-liter four is more powerful than the 1995 model's 3.0-liter six.Needless to say, all of this adds up to a much improved sport-ute.  Safety hasn't been ignored in the revamped 4Runner, which sports dual airbags.  Antilock brakes are standard with the V6 and optional on four cylinder models.  Steering response and feel have also been improved by replacing the old recirculating ball-type steering with a rack and pinion setup.  Access to the cargo area is improved by switching from a two-piece tailgate to a one-piece hatch-style liftgate with a power-down rear window.Also new are 20-ounce cupholders, a bigger console storage area, and relocated rear speakers.  Seven new exterior colors debut, and all new interior fabrics and designs round out the new 4Runner package.  Overall, a very nice effort, resulting in a tough truck with looks to match.  Pricing runs from $20,000 for a 2WD four cylinder Base model to $36,000 for a fully loaded Limited.  This lands the 4Runner right smack dab in Tahoe, Explorer and Grand Cherokee territory.

But thanks to a platform designed from the  ground up for electrification, the ID.4 is noticeably more spacious than its  conventionally powered sibling. There's a lot to like about the ID.4, including  its long list of standard convenience and technology features.  
For  2023, the ID.4 also gains a new lower-priced base Standard trim that further  helps the ID.4 stand out as one of the lowest-priced EVs in its class. However,  the Standard trim has a smaller capacity battery, and that results in less  range on a full charge: a VW-estimated 208 miles. Many rival EVs, including the  ID.4's Pro trim that has the bigger battery, can go a lot farther. Check out  our page for the latest Edmunds real-world  range tests,  but we think the ID.4 Standard should have enough range to satisfy many EV  buyers. 
There  are also a few other changes this year. Volkswagen added a few new standard  features, such as a 12-inch center touchscreen, an automatic parking system,  and enhanced capability to make it more convenient to charge at Electrify  America DC fast-charging stations. Inside, the ID.4 gains some new seat  upholstery and color choices to help liven up the cabin a bit. New wheels are  part of the 2023 changes too. 
Overall,  the ID.4 is a respectable choice for an electric SUV. But it's also one of many  recent additions to the growing electric SUV segment, which includes the  Chevrolet Bolt EUV, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6, Nissan Ariya  and Tesla Model Y.
What's it like to live with?
We  added a Volkswagen ID.4 to our long-term review fleet for a year, and we've  been driving Volkswagen's latest electric SUV all over town to find out what we  like, what we don't like, and what might be deal-breakers for potential EV  shoppers. Read all about our  experiences in the Volkswagen ID.4 here. Note that while we tested a 2021  model, most of our observations apply to this year's ID.4 too. The  ID.4 comes so well equipped that we don't think you need to venture too far  into the lineup. We'd pick the Pro trim  for the larger battery, and if you need more power and traction, you can always  add all-wheel drive to get that second motor.",,,,rear wheel drive , 1-speed direct drive 
Chevrolet,chevrolet suburban,2008,chevrolet suburban 2008,"['Seats up to nine people, class-leading cargo capacity, attractive interior, comfortable seating and ride, smooth V8.']","[""Optional third-row seat doesn't fold flat, acceleration is sluggish when fully loaded, portly curb weight hampers handling.""]",4.3,"Side curtain airbags are now standard on all models. The 3/4-ton Suburban 2500 now comes with a six-speed automatic transmission and stability control. OnStar's turn-by-turn navigation is now standard on LT and LTZ trim levels. It doesn't have a fold-flat third row and it's heavier than we'd like, but if you need a full-size SUV with maximum capacity, the 2008 Chevrolet Suburban is a compelling choice. The first Chevrolet Suburban was introduced during Franklin Roosevelt's first administration. Nineteen presidential terms and 71 years later, the Suburban is still truckin', providing big families with the type of space and utility that today's growing onslaught of crossover SUVs just can't match.Dramatically redesigned and improved last year, the 2008 Chevrolet Suburban continues to impress with its handsome and well-built interior, smooth V8 engines and improved road manners. As always, the big Chevy sports a traditional body-on-frame truck chassis with a solid rear axle, but body stiffness was increased last year and a coil spring front suspension was added to create a better ride. A new rack-and-pinion steering system improves handling, while more powerful brakes do a better job of halting the hefty SUV.Few vehicles can seat eight people, let alone nine, and for those who truly need this type of seating capacity, the Suburban is really only matched by its GMC Yukon XL clone and a handful of full-size vans. Furthermore, its cavernous cargo hold and mighty towing ability are hard to beat. Competitors like the Ford Expedition EL and Nissan Armada offer advantages such as a fold-flat third-row seat, but overall we think the 2008 Chevrolet Suburban is an excellent choice among jumbo SUVs. Chevrolet offers two V8s for the 2008 Suburban. Standard on the Suburban 1500 (half-ton) is a 5.3-liter V8 with 320 horsepower and 340 pound-feet of torque. Equipped with GM's cylinder deactivation technology, this V8 promises better than normal fuel efficiency to the tune of 14 city and 19 highway for 2008. A 6.0-liter V8 that pumps out 366  and 380 lb-ft of torque is optional on LT3 and LTZ trims. Both 1500 V8 engines come with a four-speed automatic. A 6.0-liter V8 matched to a six-speed automatic that packs 352  and 383 lb-ft of torque comes on the Suburban 2500 (3/4-ton). With either the 1500 or 2500 model, buyers have a choice of either rear- or four-wheel drive. An automatic locking rear differential is optional on all trims except the LTZ, on which it's standard. Properly equipped, the Suburban 2500 can tow up to 9,700 pounds. Four-wheel antilock disc brakes are standard on all Suburbans, as are stability control and GM's OnStar emergency communications system. Turn-by-turn navigation has been added to OnStar on LT and LTZ models. A three-row side curtain airbag system with a rollover sensor is standard on all Suburbans. In government crash tests, the 2008 Chevy Suburban was awarded a top five-star rating for protecting the driver and passenger in a frontal collision. For such a big truck, the 2008 Chevrolet Suburban is fairly quick and can get to 60 mph in less than 9 seconds. However, the 5.3-liter V8 Suburban doesn't feel nearly so quick when carrying a load of passengers. Plus, dipping into the power will quickly pull mileage down to the low teens. There are only so many ways to trick physics: Depending on the model, a Suburban can weigh anywhere from 5,600 to 6,300 pounds. A new suspension with coil-over shocks up front and a five-link setup out back along with rack-and-pinion steering make for more composed handling and a smoother ride than before. But with its hefty curb weight, the Suburban doesn't feel nimble around corners -- not that that should come as a surprise. Aimed for the horizon on an interstate, there aren't many better cruisers than the 2008 Suburban. The cabin is quiet at speed, and the ride is comfortably controlled over bumps. Like the rest of GM's full-size SUVs and trucks, the Suburban's interior is a marked improvement over past iterations. Materials quality is good, fit and finish is spot on and controls are logically laid out. Depending on how you equip the Suburban, it can seat six to nine people -- a total surpassed only by full-size vans. Cargo capacity is also immense, with a maximum of 137.4 cubic feet -- a full 40 cubes larger than a Nissan Armada and a few more than the Ford Expedition EL. Although the Suburban's second row is available with a power-folding feature, the optional third-row seats must be removed manually to optimize cargo space. Based on our experience, those dense seats feel like they're constructed of depleted uranium and removing them requires not only a strong back but the ability to wrestle them out from deep inside the interior. The LT comes standard with steering-wheel-mounted and rear seat audio controls, front bucket seats with a center console, foglamps and color-keyed exterior trim. Three major equipment groups are available on the Suburban LT: LT2, LT3 and LTZ. The LT2 package adds leather seating, an in-dash six-CD changer, power-adjustable pedals, remote vehicle starting and rear parking assist. Move up to the LT3 and these features are added: heated front seats (with 12-way driver adjustment) and a Bose audio system with satellite radio. The Convenience Package 2 adds heated washer fluid, rain-sensing front wipers and a power liftgate to the LT3.Setting the Suburban LTZ apart are 20-inch alloy wheels, a locking rear differential, a power liftgate, rain-sensing wipers, power-folding second-row seats with heat, the Autoride rear air suspension and a third-row seat. Many of the features that are standard on upper trim/package levels, specifically the third-row seat, are available on the lower levels as options. Other major options for the Suburban include a navigation system, a rearview camera, power-retracting running boards and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.",V8 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

It comes as a result of a collaboration with Toyota, which builds its  related bZ4X EV in the same plant. As is the case with its Toyota sibling, the  Solterra has some great selling points as well as some drawbacks.  
Size-wise,  the Solterra is similar to Subaru's Forester. And as a Subaru, it benefits from  some light off-road capabilities thanks to its elevated ride height and 8.3  inches of ground clearance. It also comes with all-wheel drive by way of two  electric motors. They combine to produce a modest 215 horsepower — a  dual-motor Tesla Model Y generates approximately twice as much — but  we drove the Solterra on both city streets and off-road and found that it has  suitable acceleration for most people.
Subaru  estimates the Solterra can go up to 228 miles of range on a single charge,  which is also on the low end for EVs today. Some rivals can push past 300  miles. On the plus side, owners can take advantage of a free home charger or a  credit for charging on the EVgo network. For longer trips, you have access to  10 days of free Subaru rentals at participating dealers.
Like  many electric vehicles, the Solterra makes an instant impression inside. It has  interesting textures such as a denim-like cloth dashboard, soft plastic touch  points, and a glossy piano black center console and touchscreen area. The  combination lends the Solterra a distinctive eco-focused vibe compared with  traditional compact SUVs. From the driver's seat, the steering wheel and  forward digital display screen are housed in a futuristic-looking design that  sits higher than usual. 
There  are definitely some areas where the 2023 Subaru Solterra comes up short against  other top EVs, but it may redeem itself in other areas once we can get one in  and run it through our usual battery of tests and evaluations. In the meantime,  we suggest also checking out the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Hyundai Ioniq 5, Kia EV6  and Tesla Model Y as part of your search for an electric SUV. The  base Premium trim gets our  recommendation since there are no performance or range differences between  models. You get a lot of standard features for the money along with plenty of  advanced safety features, including adaptive cruise control.",,,,all wheel drive , 1-speed direct drive

Suspension is too soft.'],4.5,"Side-impact airbags debut on the 1998 Toyota Camry. Depowered front airbags further enhance this car's ability to protect its occupants in a crash. An engine immobilizer feature is now part of the theft-deterrent package. The Camry is the new standard for midsized sedans.  It has room inside for five adults, attractive yet conservative styling, exceptional pep from an available 24-valve 3.0-liter V6 and a price that doesn't break the bank so long as options are kept to a minimum.  Last year, Toyota redesigned their midsize sedan and decided to go after the number one sales spot with vigor.  At the end of the model year, sales showed that Toyota had the numbers to become the best-selling car in America.  New and old Toyota customers have fallen in love with the Camry because of its reliability, durability and good value.  The new Camry can be equipped for rugged family life, or plush luxury touring.  Options on higher-grade LE and XLE models include a premium sound system, leather interior trim and a power moonroof.  With the V6 engine, the Camry accelerates strongly.  Braking is swift and sure with the antilock system, and Camry hangs on well in corners despite rather meek all-season radials.  Inside, a two-inch increase in wheelbase has allowed designers to maximize space, creating a larger Camry than the 1996 model.  Controls and gauges are laid-out nicely in a flowing dashboard, and most secondary controls are within easy reach of the driver.  We are big fans of the fingertip cruise control stalk that allows easy operation without the chance of inadvertent activation.  Camry CE sticks with a fixed-mast stereo antenna, but LE and XLE get an in-glass antenna, which reduces wind noise.  Storage areas are abundant and feature a deep center console, door bins, and dashboard bins.  Front cupholders accommodate 20-ounce bottles of your favorite beverage.  Is the Camry the perfect family conveyance?  Not out of the box, but it's close.  We'd opt for a lightly loaded CE with the V6 engine, add some aftermarket alloy wheels, and do a bit of suspension and tire work to create the ultimate sleeper of staid bread-and-butter sedans.",V6 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

New features for the 2001 model year -- standard front and rear side curtain airbags, optional steering wheel controls for the audio and cruise for GLS (standard on the GLX) and a standard trunk entrapment release button -- carry over into 2001.5 Passats. This is our favorite midsize sedan and wagon. Don't make your family vehicle choice without driving one. Volkswagen has been busy recently, buying up smaller carmakers, designing 12- and 16-cylinder engines and creating a new line of luxury vehicles. But the company has also found time to tweak its already excellent Passat sedan and wagon for mid-2001.The exterior styling of the 2001.5 Passat is sharper and more Audi-like than the previous iteration, with a chrome-trimmed grille, new clear-lens headlight and taillight clusters and integrated foglights. Volkswagen engineers also gave the car a more structurally rigid body, which will yield greater crashworthiness, better handling and tighter exterior panel fits. Of course, we already liked the Passat's physique, and those who like a few more rounded edges may want to stick with a 2001 model.Base-trim Passats have become an even better value, as Volkswagen has given the 1.8-liter turbocharged engine a significant power boost. This engine now makes 170 horsepower (up from 150 for 2001) and a nearly lag-free 166 foot-pounds of torque (up from 155). This powerplant has always offered good acceleration (power upgrade or no), and it contributes to the Passat's overall grin factor.The 2.8-liter V6 remains unchanged; it makes 190 horsepower and 206 ft-lbs of twist. Optional on Passat GLS models and standard on GLX models, this V6 puts the fun back in functional with its broad torque band and strong acceleration. Both engines can be mated to a five-speed manual transmission or a five-speed automatic. The latter transmission is an automanual, such that you can drive it as an automatic or shift the gears manually (no clutch, though!).Regardless of drivetrain choice, all Passats offer superb steering, handling and braking. With ABS four-wheel discs standard on all trim levels, an independent front and rear suspension and perfectly weighted power rack-and-pinion steering, the Passat is one of the most entertaining midsize sedans or wagons. Some drivers might find body roll to be excessive during canyon runs, but overall the ride quality is excellent. Buyers in cold climates or seeking the stability of all-wheel drive can opt to equip their Passats with VW's 4MOTION all-wheel-drive system.Inside the 2001.5 models, drivers will find the familiar Passat trimmings with a few more upscale-type features: chrome-trimmed gauges, a telescoping steering wheel and an updated center console with a wider front armrest, two integrated cupholders and a compartmentalized storage area. The backseat also receives an integrated armrest with a cupholder and additional storage.Of course, the Passat already offered an impressive list of standard features. Items like air conditioning, cruise control, one-touch power windows, power locks, remote keyless entry, remote trunk release, full-size spare tire, side airbags and heated exterior mirrors are on the base GLS models. GLX trim adds the V6 engine, sunroof, heated front seats with driver seat memory, leather seat coverings and door inserts, variable intermittent wipers with heated jets and an auto-dimming day-night mirror. The new-for-2001 side curtain airbag system protects the heads of front and rear passengers. Seat-mounted side airbags for front passengers have been standard since the current-generation Passat was introduced in 1998.These mid-year changes should only add to what is one of the best midsize sedans on the market. Based on a stretched Audi A4 platform and built with plenty of Audi parts, the Passat looks, feels and drives like a more substantial car than its base price tag would indicate. Mid-year styling updates should wear well in this new century and its solid construction should keep the car feeling new as the miles add up.

These figures represent a substantial improvement over the previous anemic four cylinder and wheezy V6.  In fact, the 2.7-liter four is more powerful than the 1995 model's 3.0-liter six, and is nearly as powerful as the base engine found in the Ford Explorer XL.Needless to say, all of this adds up to a very competitive sport-ute.  Safety isn't ignored in the 4Runner, either, which sports dual airbags and standard antilock brakes on V6 models.  (Antilock brakes are optional on four-cylinder models.)Overall, the 4Runner is a very nice truck which provides the sophistication that we have come to expect from Toyota products with the overall ruggedness more often associated with Jeeps.  Prices are high,  however, running from $21,000 for a 2WD four-cylinder Base model to over $36,000 for a fully loaded Limited.  This lands the 4Runner right smack dab in the Mercedes-Benz ML320, Nissan Pathfinder LE and Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited territory.

It may not be the sportiest compact available, but the well-rounded 2008 Hyundai Accent provides a lot of car for the money. Prior to its redesign two years ago, the Hyundai Accent was an easily overlooked economy car. It had an outstanding warranty and an affordable price, but compromised performance and handling kept it from joining the compact leaders. All that changed with the third-generation overhaul, which provided the Accent with a responsive new engine and accompanying performance boost that enabled the Hyundai to keep up with its leading rivals.An Edmunds ""Most Wanted Sedan Under $15,000"" last year, the Hyundai Accent's solid entry-level value continues in 2008 with minor upgrades inside that include revised instrument panels on SE hatchbacks and GLS sedans. Cash-poor enthusiasts will want to check out the SE trim as it delivers more inspiring performance thanks to sport-tuned chassis components and a new B&M sport shifter for the manual transmission.The 2008 Hyundai Accent is certainly one of the better economy-minded cars available. True, it faces stiff competition from models such as the sporty Honda Fit, the well-equipped Nissan Versa and the youthful Toyota Yaris. On the domestic side, Ford's freshened Focus might also deserve a look. Overall, though, the entry-level Hyundai Accent remains a sensible and value-filled economy car in which to face the daily grind. Every Hyundai Accent comes with a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine delivering 110 horsepower and 106 pound-feet of torque. Transferring power to the front wheels is a standard five-speed manual transmission, with a four-speed automatic available across the lineup. Performance and fuel economy are competitive with similarly equipped rivals, with 2008 EPA estimates ranging from 27 mpg city and 32 mpg highway with the five-speed manual to 24/33 mpg with the optional automatic transmission. Unusual for a vehicle in this segment, all models include standard front-seat side airbags and full-length side curtain airbags. Antilock brakes are standard on SE coupes and optional on GLS sedans. In government frontal-impact crash tests, the 2008 Hyundai Accent sedan scored a perfect five stars for front occupant protection. It didn't fare as well in the side-impact category, with four stars for front occupant protection and three stars for rear-seat passengers. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety testing, the Accent scored a second-highest ""Acceptable"" rating for frontal-offset collisions and a ""Poor"" ranking in side-impact tests. Though it certainly can't be considered quick, the 2008 Hyundai Accent performs capably, without too much protest from under the hood. On smooth roads, the ride is calm and forgiving on GS and GLS models, while the performance-oriented SE delivers a firmer driving experience with greater feedback. Though generally pleasant, its ride comfort suffers over bumpy surfaces, as the suspension and steering tend to transmit too much harshness into the cabin. Handling and braking are both respectable, though, with good stability and short stopping distances for a car in this price range. Inside, the Accent's design is simple and functional. The quality of materials is acceptable, and the Accent's cabin provides a comfortable atmosphere with a feeling of spaciousness from the driver seat. Outward visibility is very good, with the short hood allowing a panoramic view of what's ahead. Hyundai likes to boast that the Accent provides more interior volume than a Honda Civic. If you plan on carrying passengers in the back, keep in mind that the Versa and Yaris hatchbacks offer more rear-seat legroom. Cargo room is average for its class, with more than 12 cubic feet in the sedan and nearly 16 cubic feet in the hatchback. The Accent SE hatchback gains the GS's optional features as standard; it also comes with 16-inch alloy wheels, a sport-tuned suspension, foglamps, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter and a rear center armrest with cupholders. A sunroof is an exclusive option. The Accent GLS sedan gets air-conditioning and the audio system as standard; full power accessories and 15-inch alloy wheels are optional.

Yes, those who formerly wheeled around town in a Cadillac or Lincoln or Mercedes, and wouldn't feel quite right in a pickup truck, appear to have twirled their affections toward the biggest passenger vehicles in the General Motors repertoire.  Chevrolet, in fact, considers the Suburban ""as suited to the country club as to a roughneck oil field.""Mechanically, you get the same layout in the smaller Chevrolet Tahoe, but that vehicle is only available with Chevy's Vortec 5700 V8 engine.

Oh, there's also an optional turbodiesel.  Both the half- and 3/4-ton versions come with either two- or four-wheel drive, and all have four-wheel antilock braking.This season's interior is upgraded with the addition of a driver's airbag.  Rear passengers are made more comfortable with the addition of height-adjustable outboard safety belts.  Drivers won't need to wrestle the Suburban at low speeds with the introduction of Electronic Variable Orifice power steering.  Locking the Suburban after unloading cargo is easier this year, because Chevy added a power lock switch to the cargo area.  Shifts are smoother from revised transmissions, which also improve efficiency.  Two new exterior colors debut: Medium Opal Blue Metallic and Medium Beige Mystique Metallic.Suburbans seat up to nine occupants and tow as much as five tons, when properly equipped.  For families who need plenty of room for youngsters, or for retirees who need loads of power to haul a travel trailer, a Suburban can make good sense.  Chevrolet can expect competition from Ford's new Expedition for 1997, but for heavy-duty use and maximum space, Chevrolet and GMC are still the only serious games in town for a mammoth ""truck wagon.""",V8 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Dwindling sales, general buyer disinterest in sedans, and  the specter of a forthcoming electric crossover-sedan mashup mean the 300 has  outlived its usefulness. The 300 owes its longevity, in part, to the Dodge  Charger, which is produced on the same platform and has offered a two-for-one  manufacturing benefit. But with the Charger also due for an imminent exit, the  business case appears to have evaporated.  
2023  caps a good 18-year run for the 300 sedan. Chrysler sold more than 400,000  units in the first few model years, and the 300's Bentley-like styling and  affordable price made it a staple in music, fashion and lifestyle niches.  Iconic menswear designer John Varvatos even had a one-off signature edition,  which got a promo push from legendary rocker and Michigan native Iggy Pop. 
But  sales tapered off, rebounded slightly in the mid-2010s after a redesign, and  have slowed to a trickle ever since. We've been fans of the 300's plush and  spacious cabin, big trunk and comfortable ride quality. Its respectable V6 and  burly V8 engines deliver satisfying acceleration, and you can get the 300 with  all-wheel drive. It remains a smart pick that looks good in the valet line and  can comfortably cover long distances. While rival full-size sedans, including  the Volkswagen Arteon and Toyota Avalon, offer more modern tech and better fuel  economy, the 300 still makes a bold statement. 
That's especially true of the 2023 Chrysler  300C, which will end the 300 run with a roar. Limited to just 2,000 units in  the U.S., the 300C essentially plugs the Charger/Challenger's 6.4-liter V8  under the hood of the stately 300. Output is bumped to a rocking 485  and 475  lb-ft. Chrysler says the 300C sprints from zero to 60 mph in 4.3 seconds. The  300C also features four-piston Brembo brakes for increased stopping performance  and adaptive dampers that will allow the 300C to switch between laidback  cruiser and corner-tackling sport sedan. We think the Touring L trim is a pretty good option. It comes with stylish  20-inch wheels and leather upholstery, and its soft suspension offers a more  comfortable ride than the S trim's sport-tuned suspension. The Touring L is  also available with all-wheel drive for added traction when the snow flies. To  this, we'd add the Popular Equipment group for the panoramic sunroof and the  Comfort group for the ventilated seats.",V6 cylinder ,,,, 8-speed shiftable automatic

Audi,audi a5,2019,audi a5 2019,"['Understated and classy interior', 'Strong overall performance', 'Plenty of standard and optional tech features']",['Limited interior storage'],4.7,"If  you're shopping for a luxury coupe, you're likely expecting refinement,  comfort, cutting-edge tech and performance. Lucky for you, the 2019 Audi A5 has  all of those. Coming off a full redesign last year, the A5 returns with some  minor changes. This time around, the manual transmission has been discontinued,  as have the adaptive suspension dampers. Also, some items have been moved from  the options column to the list of standard features. Otherwise,  the A5 remains unchanged, and that's a good thing. It occupies a narrow space  between the sporty BMW 4 Series and the classically luxurious Mercedes-Benz  C-Class. Like those German rivals, the A5 is available as a convertible, but  the line also includes a four-door hatchback called the A5 Sportback.Competition  among these three luxury coupes is tight. The Audi is the newest, but with  BMW's and Benz's frequent updates, there's really no clear winner or loser  among them. Your choice will probably come down to personal preference, but we  like the A5 for its balanced approach to luxury and performance. Edmunds has not yet driven any version of the 2018 Audi A5. However, we've driven the related A4 and S5. Here's our take on what's significant about it and what you can expect. If the mechanically similar A4 sedan is any indication, the A5 will rise to the top when it comes to performance. It will also score slightly above average for everyday drivability. We do suspect there will be a slight hesitation from the four-cylinder engine upon initial acceleration, though. The A5's seats are firm and well shaped for hours of comfortable driving. The cabin should be as quiet and isolating as those of the A4 and the S5 that we've evaluated, and the available adaptive suspension should smooth out the ride further. The A5 gets high marks for its modern and elegantly simple interior. The materials quality is excellent for the class, and the controls are just where you'd want them as a driver. The rear seats are rather small and best suited for smaller passengers. The A5 coupe's 11.6-cubic-foot trunk isn't the biggest in the class, but it should be enough for most cargo, and the flat load floor and handy hooks score it additional points. Interior storage for personal items is merely adequate. Audi's MMI is one of the easier infotainment systems to operate, and the screen placement further reduces distraction. The available virtual instrument panel is as appealing to the eye as it is useful and effective. It makes cutting-edge tech as accessible as it can be. The Premium Plus trim strikes a good  balance of added features and price. In addition to some nice creature  comforts, there are plenty of tech upgrades to justify the jump in price from  the base Premium. Standard Premium trim features for the coupe  (availability for the convertible and hatchback might vary slightly) include  18-inch wheels, LED headlights, automatic wipers, a panoramic sunroof,  selectable drive modes, tri-zone automatic climate control, leather upholstery,  power-adjustable front seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, Bluetooth, a  7-inch infotainment display with Audi's MMI interface, a rearview camera, two  USB ports and a 10-speaker sound system. Low-speed forward collision warning  and mitigation is included.Stepping  up to the Premium Plus trim gets you  auto-dimming and power-folding exterior mirrors, a hands-free trunklid, front  and rear parking sensors, keyless entry and ignition, Audi's Connect Care (with  4G LTE connection and emergency communications), rear collision mitigation,  blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, a digital instrument  panel, a wireless charging pad with signal booster, an 8.3-inch infotainment  display, a navigation system, heated front seats, driver-seat memory functions,  a 10-speaker CD player and satellite radio.The Prestige trim rounds out the lineup  with adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, lane keeping assist, a  head-up display, remote monitoring and vehicle function controls via a  smartphone app, an automated parking system, a surround-view camera system and  a 19-speaker Bang & Olufsen audio system.Most  features on the upper trim levels are available on supporting trims as options.

Power adjustable accelerator and brake pedals are now standard on all F-150 Lariat models and optional on XL and XLT trucks. The Work Series model is no longer available, but there is a newly created Work Truck option group that deletes certain equipment from the XL model. Child safety-seat anchors and four-wheel ABS are now standard equipment on all trucks. XL and XLT trucks have upgraded standard-equipment radios. One of our favorite light-duty pickups, especially in Super Crew format. In the music scene, artists that top the sales charts are rarely considered the best in terms of quality. The same thing goes for prime-time TV shows or the most popular fast food restaurants. It almost seems to be an inverse relationship; the worse a product is, the more popular it is.This theory doesn't bode well for the Ford F-150. Not only is it the best-selling pickup in the country, it's the best-selling vehicle, period. But for whatever reason, the F-150 bucks the trend. It has the sales numbers and the quality.One particular advantage to the F-150 is its wide range of body and option configurations. You can order the F-150 as either a Regular Cab, SuperCab or SuperCrew, the SuperCrew being the double cab model with four doors and a short bed. Then, on everything except the SuperCrew, you have the choice of a 6 1/2- or 8-foot cargo box in either Styleside or Flareside design. There are three trim levels: XL, XLT and Lariat. There's also two special SuperCrew models offered this year: The Harley Davidson F-150 and the King Ranch F-150, each with unique trim and features.Ford offers three different engines. The smallest is a 205-horsepower, 4.2-liter V6 with either a manual or automatic transmission. Next up is a 4.6-liter V8 with 220 horsepower and 290 foot-pounds of torque. The biggest engine available is a 5.4-liter V8 generating 260 horsepower and 350 foot-pounds of torque.Towing and cargo capacities vary depending on model. For maximum payload ability, you'll want to order the 7700 Payload Group, which includes mechanical modifications that increase gross vehicle weight to 7,700 pounds.The F-150's feature list is comparable to many family cars and luxury sedans. Driver and passenger front airbags are standard, as are four-wheel ABS and child safety-seat anchor points. Lariat-trim F-150s are the most luxurious, and they come standard with features like 17-inch wheels, power adjustable pedals and leather seating.Even more car-like is the F-150 SuperCrew. It has been designed for consumers who want more interior space without compromising the functional capability and versatility of a full-size pickup. Unlike the SuperCab, which has smaller hinged doors that swing out from the C-pillar, the SuperCrew actually mates an Expedition cabin with a shortened cargo bed. It has four full-size doors separated by a B-pillar on each side, with inside and outside handles on each door. Despite the larger cabin, the F-150 SuperCrew is still the same overall length as the SuperCab model.On both pavement and rocky trails, the F-150 offers up a stable ride and plenty of power. Steering is somewhat twitchy, but otherwise this truck can be used for long freeway trips with no problem. The front seats are comfortable, and the extra rear-seat space in SuperCab models is perfect for extra cargo or children. Use the handy Super Crew for adults who need to ride in back. The interior design mirrors that of the popular Expedition SUV, with most of the controls and switches easy to find and operate.Overall, the F-150 is an excellent blend of style, comfort and utility. The full-size trucks from General Motors, DaimlerChrysler and Toyota all have their individual advantages, but none can match the Ford's level of competence in all areas. About the only significantly negative thing you can say about a F-150 is that there's just too many of them on the road!",V6 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Mazda,mazda 6,2011,mazda 6 2011,"['Roomy cabin', 'big trunk', 'muscular performance from V6', 'smooth automatic transmissions', 'sporty handling.']",,4.5,"For 2011, the Mazda 6 receives minor updates. The headlights and foglights have been restyled and the sideview mirrors on the Touring Plus and Grand Touring models now feature integrated turn signals. Mazda has discontinued the base SV trim level and dropped manual transmission availability for the Touring trim. Fuel economy sees a slight increase for models with automatic transmissions. A few features have been shuffled between trim levels as well. The well-rounded 2011 Mazda 6 ranks highly among family sedans for its sporty driving dynamics and spacious interior. Who says a family sedan has to be sedate? Amid a deep field  of competitors, the 2011 Mazda 6 proves otherwise, with athletic performance  and little in the way of sacrifice. In addition, sleek styling, comfort for  full-sized adults, top safety scores and a price that won't break the bank all  combine to make it a worthy choice.
Mazda prides itself in delivering an exhilarating driving  experience, and even in the rather tame sedan segment, it manages to inject  some personality into the mix. How much fun you'll have behind the wheel of the  Mazda 6 largely depends on which engine you pick. The base four-cylinder is  just fine for the daily commute, but the lively V6 certainly increases the  grins per mile. Handling is admirable for every Mazda 6, and anyone can  appreciate this car's spacious interior and large trunk. There's not much to  complain about, with subpar fuel economy and the use of some chintzy plastics  in the cabin being the car's only notable drawbacks.
That said, competition in the family sedan class has gotten  more formidable with the introduction of the 2011 Hyundai Sonata and  the 2011 Kia Optima. Both  trump the Mazda 6 in terms of price and features and are competitive in regard  to performance, though they lack the interior space of the Mazda. Other top  choices include the sporty 2011  Nissan Altima, the very impressive 2011 Ford Fusion and the  stalwart 2011 Honda Accord.  At the end of the day, there isn't a bad pick among these choices, and the 2011  Mazda 6 is certainly worth a look. The 2011 Mazda 6 i versions are powered by a 2.5-liter  four-cylinder engine that produces 170 horsepower and 167 pound-feet of torque.  A six-speed manual transmission is standard on the i Sport. A five-speed  automatic with manual shift control is offered on the i Sport and is the only  choice available on i Touring, i Touring Plus and i Grand Touring models.
Mazda 6 s models are powered by a 3.7-liter V6 that produces  272  and 269 lb-ft of torque and are available only with a six-speed  automatic. In Edmunds testing, a V6 model reached 60 mph from a standstill in a  quick 6.5 seconds, while the four-cylinder automatic required a more pedestrian  9.1 seconds.
The EPA estimates fuel economy at 21 mpg city/30 mpg highway  and 24 mpg in combined driving for the four-cylinder i Sport with the  five-speed manual. The Mazda 6 i models with the automatic are rated at  22/31/25 mpg and the V6-powered versions stand at 18/27/21 mpg, which is at the  low end for this segment. Standard safety features for all 2011 Mazda 6 models include  antilock disc brakes, stability and traction control, front-seat side airbags  and full-length side curtain airbags. In Edmunds brake testing, both the i and  s Grand Touring models came to a stop from 60 mph in about 125 feet.
The Mazda 6 has not been rated using the government's new,  more strenuous 2011 crash testing procedures. Its 2010 ratings (which aren't  comparable to 2011 tests) resulted in a perfect five-star rating for frontal  and side-impact protection for all occupants. Likewise, the Insurance Institute  for Highway Safety gave the Mazda 6 its highest score of ""Good"" for  frontal-offset and side impacts, while roof strength tests yielded a  second-best ""Acceptable"" rating. Among competing family sedans, the 2011 Mazda 6 is notable  for its nimble handling. It's certainly more confident in the curves than the  Honda Accord, and almost as accomplished as the class-leading Nissan Altima.  This athleticism results in a slightly firm ride quality, however, and road  noise is also a bit more prominent, but neither is particularly bothersome,  even when riding on the big 18-inch wheels.
While the base 2.5-liter four-cylinder will likely satisfy  most drivers, its leisurely acceleration and wheezy engine note may be a bit of  a turnoff. Opting for the higher Mazda 6 s trim levels will get you a  significant increase in power as well as improved handling with wider tires.  Unfortunately, this added performance is tempered by a transmission that is  slow to react in both automatic and manual modes. The 2011 Mazda 6 features an interior that is attractive and  modern in design. A gracefully arching center stack sweeps from the top of the  dash down to the center console. Some of the controls, however, are a bit more  complicated than those of its competitors. Red electroluminescent gauges  further enhance the visual appeal, and the roomy backseat (even for 6-footers)  is a definite plus. Legroom and headroom are plentiful in all seats, but the  wide front seats might lack lateral support for narrower occupants.
Despite the Mazda 6's attractive design, some cheaper plastic  materials are scattered throughout the cabin. Higher trim levels have odd  black-and-silver-patterned flourishes that might be an acquired taste for some.  Points are also deducted for the underperforming standard audio system, and  even the upgraded Bose system could disappoint some listeners. On the plus  side, the Mazda 6's 16.6-cubic-foot trunk is one of the biggest in its class,  while the trunk's unobtrusive hinge mechanisms and the 60/40 split-folding rear  seats further enhance cargo-hauling capabilities. 
The i Sport comes standard with 16-inch steel wheels, a  manually height-adjustable driver seat, full power accessories, keyless entry,  air-conditioning, cruise control, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls, a  tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel and a six-speaker CD/MP3 stereo system with  an auxiliary audio jack.
The i Touring model steps up the feature content with  17-inch alloy wheels, foglights, a trip computer, a power driver seat, an  in-dash six-CD changer, Bluetooth phone and audio connectivity, upgraded  interior trim and a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob.
Opting for the i Touring Plus will get you a sunroof, a  blind-spot monitoring system, electroluminescent instrument gauges and outside mirrors  with integrated turn signals. The i Grand Touring model adds leather  upholstery, heated front seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, a rearview  camera, a multi-information display and a 10-speaker Bose sound system. The s  Touring Plus model is outfitted identically to the i Touring Plus, except for  the engine, transmission and some exterior trim. The s Grand Touring adds  18-inch cast-aluminum wheels.
We expect one of the more popular options will be the  Technology package, which is available for Grand Touring models. It includes  automatic xenon headlights, automatic wipers, heated outside mirrors, keyless  ignition/entry, an auto-dimming rearview and driver-side mirror, satellite  radio, driver memory settings and a power passenger seat. A voice-activated  navigation system is available only for Grand Touring models and comes with a  7-inch touchscreen display and real-time traffic.

Bmw,bmw x7,,bmw x7 2023,"['Strong engine performance', 'Smooth ride', 'Impeccable interior', 'Cutting-edge tech and displays']",,,"BMW  has thrown a new coat of paint at its flagship three-row SUV, both in literal  and figurative senses. Literally, the automaker had purged five exterior colors  from the 2023 BMW X7 lineup but added five new ones (two blues and three grays,  if you were wondering). But BMW marks the first-generation X7's midway point  figuratively with a fresh dose of more power for its six-cylinder engine, a  rebuilt V8 engine (yet with the same power as before), a significant in-car  tech overhaul, and a subtle update to the X7's otherwise bold face. A new electrical assist system is added to both of the X7's six- and eight-cylinder engines, although the six-cylinder benefits most. It gains 40 horsepower for a total of 375  and about 15% more low-end torque. The V8 is built from entirely new components, according to BMW, yet makes the same power as the outgoing engine. At 523 , it feels like plenty, though the six-cylinder engine is no slouch either. The new X7 also features a sophisticated air suspension and anti-roll functions that give it a sure-footedness uncommon in its class. That helps it handle better than most rivals, with more controlled body motions around corners. Up  front, the X7 features restyled headlights, with LED intensity packed into a  narrower real estate. The oversized kidney grille remains a love-it-or-leave-it  proposition, but assuming you love it, now you have the option to illuminate it  with multiple tiny LED accents. Inside the cabin, two separate high-definition  dash displays seamlessly join into one expansive curved widescreen,  incorporating both digital driver instruments and the X7's infotainment nerve  center. It's a truly impressive unit, among the best in the business, and its  curvature encourages the passenger to take control of functions such as  navigation that might otherwise distract a driver.The  cumulative changes give the X7 an edge in a competitive class of large luxury  SUVs. We're still partial to the X7's main rival, the Mercedes-Benz GLS since  it better embodies the space and luxury most buyers seek. And others like the  Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade outmatch the X7 in cargo space and  towing capacity. But if you prefer a big SUV that can still handle corners at  high speed, the refreshed 2023 X7 is one of your best bets. The  M60i offers remarkable performance, with a rowdy V8 that moves the big SUV with  total authority and sings a glorious song along the way. But it's a commitment,  both in the price on the contract and at the pump. We'd stick with the  well-equipped xDrive40i. The  additional power for this year's six-cylinder makes it more potent, and you can  add many of the M60i's features as options. You'll certainly want to consider  the Driving Assistance Professional package as it bundles a variety of advanced  driver aids.",V8 cylinder ,,,all wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic 
Gmc,gmc savana-cargo,2002,gmc savana-cargo 2002,"['Powerful V8 engine choices, cavernous interior.']","['Odd styling, cheap interior materials.']",3.2,"GMC's full-size van gets only minor improvements, such as a more efficient starter and a stronger steering gear housing. Models with an 8,600-pound or above GVWR and either the 8100 V8 or 6.5-liter diesel engine are newly certified as Low Emissions Vehicles in California. How to you choose between a Chevrolet or a GMC full-size van? Which dealer is closest to your house? They're basically the same vehicle. And these GM vans stack up well against the formidable Ford Econoline and ancient has-been Dodge Ram Van. As long as the Savana provides what you need in this kind of vehicle, it's tough to go wrong here. When the then-new Savana arrived in small numbers for 1996, it had been 25 years since GM redesigned its full-size van. The old GMC Rally Van and Vandura were introduced way back in 1971 (when vans were still groovy) and sold steadily until they were finally discontinued. Competition and safety regulations had forced GM to redo the big vans for '96, but by then Ford had already re-engineered its Econoline twice! To help distinguish GM's all-new rounded-off design, GMC rebadged its new van Savana. The Savana cargo van is available in 135- and 155-inch wheelbases and three weight series (1500, 2500 or 3500). Their stripped down interiors are ready for upfitting with tool racks, parts bins or whatever it is you need to haul in the comfort and security of an enclosed cabin. Two trim levels are available, SL and SLT (the latter only for fleet buyers looking to create conversion vans)GM's full-size vans feature flush glass and door handles, hidden door hinges, standard four-wheel antilock brakes and dual airbags. Front foot- and legroom is adequate, and front seats offer a wide range of travel. Front air conditioning and rear heat ducts are standard. The center console contains two cupholders, an auxiliary power outlet and storage for items like CDs and cassettes. Inside the short-wheelbase Savana, you'll find 267 cubic feet of cargo area, while the extended version provides a whopping 317 cubic feet of volume. Rear hinged doors open a full 180 degrees for easy loading and do not conceal high-mounted taillights when opened. For hauling, gross vehicle weight ratings of up to 9,500 pounds are available on either wheelbase. The base engine is a 200-horsepower Vortec 4300 V6. Optional motors include a 220-horse Vortec 5000 V8, the venerable 255-horse Vortec 5700 V8, and a powerful Vortec 8100 big block V8 that makes 340 ponies and a whopping 455 pound-feet of torque.

The round-topped rear end and sheer size of this van make it seem as if you are looking at the back end of some sort of commuter train car.

Despite a great warranty and good build quality, we'd probably tell our friends to get a slightly used Japanese car instead. This may not be the case for long if Hyundai maintains its upward trajectory, though. Hyundai is on a mission to reinvent itself in the minds of the American car-buying public. After a rocky period in the early '90s that had people saying, ""Hyundais sure are inexpensive...and you get what you pay for,"" the company has unleashed several winners in a row. The Elantra offers impressive power and utility for its class, the Sonata is a roomy and well-built midsize sedan, and the Tiburon, uh, well, the Tiburon is a unique piece of work. Additionally, all new Hyundais come with an impressive 10 year/100,000-mile drivetrain warranty.The 2000 Accent is further proof of the ""New Hyundai."" The car has been redesigned from the ground up and offers a larger cabin, refined engine, smoother ride and better handling. It's also got a new look that is supposed to be both contemporary and conservative. We're not too sure about its new look, but as one of the 180 countries in which Hyundai hopes to sell the Accent, our opinion doesn't really matter much, does it?What does matter is that this new Accent is larger in almost every way. Wheelbase, overall length, and overall width have all been increased, giving the Accent improved legroom, headroom and hip room. The interior features a modular instrument pod and a clean, simple center stack with climate and radio controls. Rear seat heating and ventilation ducts help keep backseat riders comfortable and the use of noise reduction material in the A- and B-pillars gives the Accent a quieter ride. The driver seat features adjustments for height and rake, as well as fore and aft settings.Three versions of the Accent are available. The base L and midlevel GS come in hatchback mode while the highline GL model occurs only in sedan form. Options range from power windows and air conditioning to heated mirrors and a CD player.Under the Accent's bulbous bodywork sits a MacPherson strut independent front suspension and a dual link rear suspension. Stabilizer bars at both ends control excessive lean while the use of hydraulic engine mounting means reduced noise, vibration and harshness. The Accent can be ordered with optional ABS and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD), which monitors weight distribution within the vehicle to improve ABS effectiveness during quick stops. Additional safety features include depowered airbags, seatbelt pre-tensioners, reinforced A-and B-pillars and dual side-impact beams.The base engine remains a 1.3-liter four-cylinder with a larger 1.5-liter optional. The larger engine drags the Accent to 60 mph in just over 11 seconds, if equipped with the five-speed manual transmission. A four-speed automatic is available in either the GS Coupe or the GL Sedan, but we stopped timing zero-to-60 acceleration, with this transmission, after 14 seconds.Hyundai has made great strides in the last three years and we're cautiously gaining respect for its products. In a world of Kias, Daewoos and used Hondas, the new Accent has plenty to offer.

All 2001 Legacys comply with low-emission vehicle (LEV) standards and come with standard 24-hour roadside assistance. Legacy L models now include an ambient temperature gauge, a dual-mode digital trip odometer and a fixed intermittent rear wiper with washer on the wagons. GT models feature a power moonroof, six-way power driver seat, limited-slip rear differential and multireflector halogen foglights. A capable all-weather sedan or wagon for an agreeable price. Subaru distances itself from mainstream automakers by emphasizing its all-wheel-drive (AWD) lineup, thus carving out a unique niche that other companies are just now beginning to address.  Subaru emphasizes that true all-wheel drive is a transmission that ""drives all four wheels all the time,"" thus differentiating their vehicles from other entry-level luxury sedans whose AWD systems turn on the non-powered wheels only when the others lose traction. A wise move, since loyal Subaru buyers stick with the brand partially because of the wide variety of AWD models in the company's stable.       The AWD in the Subaru Legacy GT makes for a more controlled turn, giving the driver more confidence on tight curvy roads by increasing its handling ability. This is enhanced by the fully independent, sport-tuned suspension. The steering, tight and responsive, provides accurate control of the vehicle with no excessive pulling or looseness. Overall, it makes for a well-balanced, powerful ride and allows one to thread through traffic with precision.    All Legacy models have a Phase II 2.5-liter, 16-valve, 165-horsepower boxer engine under the hood.  Making 166 foot-pounds of torque @ 4,000 rpm, models come with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Subaru's H-4 design, first developed over 30 years ago for Japanese cars, makes the engine much smoother, as the cylinder vibrations cancel each other out. As a result, this engine growls, instead of roars, when you rev it. While either drivetrain offers substantial low-end torque, a bump in horsepower would greatly enhance the Legacy's fun factor and allow it to challenge more established competitors like Accord, Camry and Maxima.This year, the Brighton model is no longer available. The Legacy L now includes an ambient temperature gauge, dual mode digital trip odometer, and a fixed intermittent rear wiper with washer on the wagons, while the GT sedans and wagons get a power moonroof (dual on wagons), a six-way power driver's seat, limited-slip rear differential, multi-reflector halogen fog lights and an in-glass antenna.     Additionally, all Legacys boast conservative sheetmetal, a hidden tailpipe, standard breakaway mirrors and front and rear cupholders.  Safety features for all models include daytime running lights, front seatbelt pre-tensioners and load limiters, and a three-point seatbelt for the rear-seat center position.  Side-impact airbags are standard on the Outback Limited and GT Limited, but are not available on lesser trim levels.  The Outback has a built-in child seat option.

Hyundai is hoping for a fresh start with the 1999 Sonata, its completely redesigned midsize family sedan.  And from what we can see, they just might get it.  On the outside, Sonata's sheetmetal is all-new and highly attractive for a car that competes in a traditionally conservative segment of the market.  One-piece headlamps with integrated turn signals lend a European flavor to the Sonata's front fascia, and a sweeping character line connects the side panels with the trunk. The Sonata's unibody construction increases structural rigidity and reduces excess noise from outside the cabin.  Using a supercomputer analysis, engineers were able to develop a rigid, stronger frame without adding extra weight to the car's body.  Riding on a front double wishbone suspension and a rear five-link suspension, the Sonata's ride and handling is stable and smooth this year. Under the hood of this refined contender is a standard 2.4-liter DOHC engine making 149 horsepower and 156 foot-pounds of torque.  Buyers can upgrade to a more powerful, optional Delta V6 or get it standard if they spring for the GLS trim.  This new V6 from Hyundai is an aluminum, 2.5-liter DOHC motor that makes 170 horsepower and 166 foot-pounds of torque that peaks at 4,000 rpm, which means power off the line may be lacking for some.   Available in two trim levels (base and GLS), Sonatas can be ordered with automatic or manual transmissions mated to either engine.  Inside the cabin are plush seats, an adequate driving position, well-laid out controls and a nice-looking dashboard.  Seat-mounted side airbags are also standard fare on the Sonata this year, making for a safer ride.  Prices for 1999 start at $14,999.  For an inexpensive car, the Sonata is nicely equipped.  The base model comes with air conditioning, rear window defroster, AM/FM stereo, rear child safety door locks, power windows, power locks and power mirrors, seven-position tilt steering wheel, tinted glass, halogen headlamps and side airbags.  The step-up GLS (last year's GL and GL V6 trims have been dropped) brings with it a 100-watt, six-speaker stereo with CD player, air filtration system, center console with an armrest and storage space, heated side mirrors, cruise control, upgraded seat cloth, six-way adjustable driver's seat, 60/40 split-folding rear seats, four-wheel disc brakes, V6 engine and alloy wheels. The GLS with automatic transmission starts at $17,799.  Antilock brakes (complete with traction control) are optional on the GLS.  Load up the Sonata GLS with ABS, moonroof, leather package and power driver's seat, and it peaks at around $20,000 - no longer a bargain except when compared to a loaded Camry or Accord.   But Hyundai still has another ace up its sleeve.  Called the Hyundai Advantage, the company's new warranty program is a great incentive to buy a Hyundai over one of the many other choices on the market.  With the purchase of any Hyundai vehicle, consumers will receive an awesome 10-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty.  If the car is sold within those first 10 years, the new owner will still be entitled to a five-year, 60,000-mile powertrain warranty.  Also part of the program is five-year, 100,000-mile corrosion coverage and a limited bumper-to-bumper warranty for five years or 60,000 miles.  Additionally, the program offers free 24-hour roadside assistance for five years, which includes towing and lockout service.

Oddly reclined seatbacks.'],4.4,"Autotrac is a new optional automatic four-wheel-drive system that switches from 2WD to 4WD automatically as conditions warrant. A new option package includes heated seats and heated exterior mirrors. Second-generation airbags deploy with less force than last year. A theft-deterrent system is standard, and color selections are modified. Compact sport-utility vehicles get most of the attention nowadays, but for folks with big families--or scads of goods to lug around--they're just not spacious enough inside.  Chevrolet offers a solution to this problem with the Tahoe, based on the full-size C/K pickup platform but garageable in either two- or four-door body styles.At a glance, the four-door Tahoe and larger Suburban look nearly identical, but a Tahoe measures 20 inches shorter.  Beneath the hood sits a Vortec 5700 V8, rated for 255 horsepower.  Two-door 4WD Tahoes with LS or LT trim can be equipped with a 6.5-liter turbodiesel V8 instead of the Vortec 5700.From the driver's seat forward, Tahoes are virtually identical to Chevy's full-size pickups.  Space is massive up front.  Capable of towing as much as 7,000 pounds, four-door Tahoes seat either five or six passengers, and an underbody-mounted spare tire helps boost cargo space.On the Interstate, the Tahoe rides nicely, but the wide body takes some getting used to if you're accustomed to compacts.  Turning onto smaller roads, it suddenly feels more like a truck.  Easy to control either way, this sizable machine is reasonably maneuverable, if driven with discretion.  The V8 is strong, and the four-speed automatic transmission shifts neatly.Think about the ""entry assist"" running boards if your regular riders aren't so nimble.  They help.  So do the robust grab bars that ease entry into the rear seats.  Rear cargo doors are standard, but a lift glass version is available.New for 1998 is an optional automatic four-wheel drive system that shifts between 2WD and 4WD as conditions warrant.  No longer is it necessary to push a button on the dashboard o actively engage four-wheel traction.  Also new is an option package that includes such goodies as heated front seats, heated exterior mirrors, carpeted floor mats, an electrochromic rearview mirror with integrated compass and outside temperature readout, a rear cargo mat, a programmable Homelink transmitter, and 46mm Bilstein shocks.  A theft deterrent system is standard on all Tahoe models, and three new colors are available.Because Chevrolet targets customers with an income of $85,000 a year, luxury conveniences such as these are part of upscale Tahoe packages.  The typical prospect is an upscale 40-year-old man who currently drives a Chevy Blazer and is attracted to a vehicle's size and power.  Those attributes, the Tahoe has in abundance, as does its little-different GMC Yukon counterpart.With the introduction of the Ford Expedition, Chevrolet loses its dominance of the full-size SUV market.  Further complicating matters, the Tahoe is based on a decade-old platform, while the slightly larger, slightly less expensive Expedition is derived from all-new F-Series underpinnings.  While the Expedition is certainly the better off-road vehicle, we feel the Tahoe delivers superior urban performance due to its lower ride height, more maneuverable size, and zippy Vortec V8.  But drive both before making a final decision, unless you're a dyed-in-the-wool Chevy fan.",V8 cylinder ,," 330 lb-ft @ 2,800 ",rear wheel drive , 4-speed automatic 
Toyota,toyota sequoia,2008,toyota sequoia 2008,,"['Noticeable wind noise at highway speed', 'Awkward third-row seating position']",,"Up  until this year, the Sequoia was one of the oldest vehicle designs on sale,  having lived through three presidential administrations and countless world  events since its introduction in 2008. But Toyota finally brought its three-row  SUV into the modern age with the 2023 Toyota Sequoia, a modern design using the  same body-on-frame architecture that underpins the Tundra pickup. 
For  its third generation, the Sequoia gets new looks, an independent front  suspension, a new turbocharged V6 hybrid powertrain, increased towing  capability and an updated collection of advanced driver assist features. So  far, we like what Toyota has done with the once neglected big SUV. The new  powertrain has gobs of easily accessible power. Plant your foot at any speed,  and the transmission wastes no time to kick down a few gears and rocket the SUV  forward. Acceleration from a standstill is especially impressive for such a  large vehicle, and the sound emitted by the exhaust is so throaty you'd be  hard-pressed to identify it as anything but a burly V8.
Compared  to the outgoing Sequoia, the new version's interior is much improved. The  centerpiece of the dashboard is a newly available 14-inch touchscreen, which  definitely adds to the new Sequoia's high-tech cabin design. Wireless connectivity  for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto comes standard on all models, meaning you  don't need to use a USB cable to integrate your phone's apps into the  touchscreen. The first two rows are plenty spacious, but the third row suffers  from tight headroom and an awkward seating position due to the high floor. 
The  Sequoia competes with other big three-row SUVs like the Chevrolet Tahoe, Ford  Expedition and Jeep Wagoneer. It has a higher starting price, but it also has  more power, gets better fuel economy, and comes with a number of advanced  driving aids that cost extra on its rivals. It may have taken 14 years to get  here, but the new Sequoia appears to have been worth the wait.  One  upside of being more expensive than the competition is the Sequoia is well  equipped even in base form. The entry-level SR5 model comes with an impressive complement of useful features,  including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a 360-degree camera and a  host of advanced driver aids. Opting for the SR5 Premium package adds a touch of luxury with synthetic leather  upholstery, power third-row seats and the larger 14-inch infotainment screen.",V6 cylinder ,," 583 lb-ft @ 2,400 ",, 10-speed shiftable automatic

Think  of the M2 as a hot-rodded variant of the BMW 2 Series that's built to satisfy  driving enthusiasts. To that end, the M2 features typical M division upgrades  that include a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine good for 365  horsepower, sport-focused chassis and suspension changes, wider and stickier  tires, and bigger brakes. The  result is one exceedingly agile and entertaining sport coupe that accomplishes  its goal without sacrificing too much in the way of comfort. Sure, it's a  little bit louder inside and rides a bit firmer, but not enough to restrict its  use to a weekend-only toy. The  M2 might be our favorite BMW when it comes to driving quick, but it runs in a  highly competitive group with coupes that can offer even higher performance  levels and more exotic engines. Nevertheless, the M2's combination of luxury  and daily usability makes it an easy car to love.  The M2 is a coupe that distills the BMW performance driving experience into a highly enjoyable package. This driver-focused two-door makes little concession to its goals, but it remains comfortable enough to serve as a daily commuter. Even better, it's priced attractively among its competitors. Each  vehicle typically comes in multiple versions that are fundamentally similar.  The ratings in this review are based on our first drive of the 2017 BMW M2 (turbo 3.0L inline-6 |  6-speed manual | RWD). Thanks to its broadly powerful engine, sweet-shifting manual transmission and enjoyable handling balance, the M2 delivers the driving satisfaction you'd expect from a vehicle with an M in the name. This car is equally happy on a winding road or a racetrack. It may be a high-performance sport coupe, but the M2 doesn't make needless sacrifices to daily usability. You'll feel and hear more of the road, but you won't be punished for using the M2 to commute. Thick side bolsters on the seat keep you in place when you're exploring the car's capabilities. A tall roof and seemingly high seat position help make the M2 feel spacious for its size and easy to see out of. Being the least expensive performance BMW means the interior isn't as complicated as other models, so most features are easier to use. Because the M2 is based on a compact car, it benefits from a bit more interior and trunk space than a purpose-built sports car. Its trunk is larger than not only those of most competitors but also the more expensive that of the BMW M4. The latest BMW entertainment system is powerful and generally easy to use. Android Auto is not supported, and Apple CarPlay is optional along with wireless charging. The standard ConnectedDrive service integrates select phone apps into the entertainment system. Because the 2018 BMW M2 is available in one trim level and with only a few options, you can't really go wrong. Your biggest decision will be between the standard six-speed manual and the optional seven-speed, dual-clutch automatic. Rowing your own gears provides a more rewarding driving experience, but you'll be quicker with the automatic. Either way, we highly recommend the M Driver's package to get the day of driver training since increasing your skill will make the biggest improvement to your experience behind the wheel. Standard  equipment includes lightweight 19-inch wheels, LED headlights, keyless ignition  and entry, auto-dimming mirrors, leather upholstery, carbon-fiber interior  trim, and power-adjustable sport front seats with heating. The infotainment  system includes a 8.8-inch central display, navigation, satellite radio, a USB  input, a 12-speaker Harman Kardon sound system and BMW's ConnectedDrive phone  integration service. After  that, the options list is pretty short. An Executive package adds forward collision warning and  mitigation (with automatic emergency braking), lane departure warning, a heated  steering wheel, rear parking sensors, adaptive headlights with automatic high  beams, wireless device charging and a Wi-Fi hotspot. The M Driver's package  increases the M2's speed limiter from 155 mph to 168 mph and provides one day  of training at a BMW high-performance driving school.Stand-alone  options include a sunroof and Apple CarPlay smartphone integration.",Inline 6 cylinder ,," 343 lb-ft @ 1,400 ",rear wheel drive , 6-speed manual

An enjoyable vehicle that can't quite match the versatility of other mini SUVs. What do you do when sport-utility buyers won't drive home in your all-wheel-drive station wagon, which is dressed up like an SUV, because it looks too ""wagony""? If you're gutsy like Subaru, you put a taller, more squared-off body on your wagon chassis, and call it good. The Forester is a Subaru parts-bin exercise, and since the parts bin is rather small at Fuji Heavy Industries, which owns the upstart all-wheel-drive automaker, the car is cobbled together from a mixture of Impreza and previous-generation Legacy bits. Based on the rally-proven Impreza platform, the Forester uses the same popular all-wheel-drive system found in other Subaru models. The 2.5-liter boxer engine comes from the Legacy Outback, and makes 165 horsepower in the Forester. And, thanks to its hunkered-down stance, low center of gravity and car-based foundation, the Forester handles better than its primary competitors: the Chevrolet Tracker, Honda CR-V, Suzuki Grand Vitara and Toyota RAV4. The trade-off is lower ground clearance and less capable off-road ability, but you weren't going to go too faroff the beaten path anyway, were you? (Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.) Automatic transmissions are available on both models for an extra $800 and feature a hill-holding setup that detects the inclination of a road surface and holds a gear to maximize torque or provide engine braking. Inside is room for four adults, with a rear center position marked off for a fifth rider in a pinch. Though the Forester offers an accommodating rear seat, low step-in height, and a cavernous cargo area, the interior fabric looks and feels like terrycloth stretched over old cardboard, some secondary controls are placed illogically, and the stereo controls are difficult to operate. Two Forester models are available this year: the L and the high-end S. Air conditioning, roof rack, rear defogger, tachometer, power windows, tilt steering, rear wiper/washer, cassette stereo, antilock brakes, power door locks and cruise control are standard on the L. Theuplevel S adds a toothy chrome grille, alloy wheels, bigger tires, rear disc brakes, and upgraded interior trimmings. A limited-slip rear differential is also standard on the S for 2000. Forester options include CD player, alloy wheels (on L), a trailer hitch and a variety of cosmetic upgrades. While we are partial to the Impreza Outback Sport and Legacy Outback models, the Forester will attract buyers who want an inexpensive, functional, all-wheel-drive vehicle that looks like a truck and drives like a car.

The 2021 Chevrolet Trax checks these boxes and is  also easy to get into and see out of. But the Trax is hampered by some fairly  uncomfortable seating, a noisy, harsh ride and a back seat that could induce  claustrophobia. 
Much  of the problem is that the Trax is a fairly old design, having come out for the  2015 model year. Since then, newer and fresher competitors have arrived,  including the Hyundai Kona, Mazda CX-3 and Subaru Crosstrek. Furthermore,  Chevrolet has just introduced the Trailblazer, which is also an extra-small SUV  but considerably more modern. We recommend going with any of these picks before  settling on the Trax. In  LS trim, the Chevrolet Trax offers a decent amount of features for the money.  And while the upper-level LT trim  doesn't stand out for extra standard features, it is our pick since it holds  the promise of options including the Driver  Confidence and LT Convenience packages.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 6-speed shiftable automatic 
Lexus,lexus nx-250,2023,lexus nx-250 2023,"['Roomy and attractive cabin', 'Many desirable standard features', 'Impressive fuel economy']","['Significantly less power than rivals', 'Dull handling', 'Less cargo room than many rivals']",,"Redesigned  last year, the NX lineup returned with a second generation and a renewed  purpose to challenge established competitors like the Mercedes-Benz GLC and  Acura RDX and newcomers like the Genesis GV70. The entry-level 2023 Lexus NX 250  is key to that strategy, with its roomy interior, cutting-edge infotainment and  attractive starting price. 
The  base model offers essential features, including a bundle of useful driver aids,  but luxury buyers will likely gravitate to the Premium and Luxury trims for  more robust offerings: quilted leather upholstery, ventilated front seats, a  power liftgate, and a hi-def 14-inch touchscreen (optional on the Premium) among  others. The latter is a welcome departure from the distant display and  frustrating toucad controller of past NX models.
More  practically, the NX 250 has nearly 23 cubic feet of cargo space, roughly the  size of a standard washing machine. That's more than the GLC but less than the  GV70 or RDX, but they're slightly longer, and the NX's cargo area is easy to  access and accommodating.
The  NX 250 joins a more powerful NX 350 and two hybrids, the NX 350h and NX 450h+.  Some buyers may consider those options given the NX 250's modest power: just  203 horsepower from a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. It's adequate,  fuel-efficient (28 mpg combined) and keeps the price low, but power falls far  short of most rivals. And compared to alternatives like the RDX or BMW X3, the  Lexus lacks spirit. Pleasantly comfortable in a straight line, the NX 250 isn't  as sharp or responsive when the road bends. Still, buyers more interested in  value and fuel economy, with modest performance expectations, will find plenty  to like in the 2023 Lexus NX 250. Stick  to the base trim if you want to keep the price around $40,000, but we think  adding the Premium package makes  sense. It's not much more than the base trim yet adds appealing extras like a  hands-free liftgate and ventilated front seats. It also opens the door to  desirable options, such as the larger touchscreen, wireless phone charger and  upgraded audio system. If you're left underwhelmed by the NX 250's modest  power, consider the NX 350 or NX 450h.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 8-speed shiftable automatic

Subaru,subaru legacy,1996,subaru legacy 1996,,,,"A new sport model debuts, with a larger, more powerful engine. The 2.5GT is available in sedan or wagon format. The luxury-oriented LSi model also gets the new motor. A knobby-tired, raised-roof Outback wagon appears, offering 7.3 inches of ground clearance and an optional 2.5-liter engine. Designed specifically for American consumers, the Outback provides a carlike ride with light-duty off-road ability. The Legacy is a model of car that suffers from multiple personality disorder; half family sedan, half sport-utility wagon, this car has a lot of diversity.  Try to imagine another lineup of vehicles that competes with both the Toyota Camry and the Jeep Cherokee for customers.  Not too many are there?Stying on the Legacy sedan is attractive, and the availablity of AWD on any trim-level makes this car as desirable as any Toyota Camry or Honda Accord.  Unlike the Camry and Accord, however, the Legacy doesn't have the power to match its sharp handling and good looks.  An optional six-cylinder engine, or better yet the resurrection of the 2.2 L turbo, would inject much needed vigor into an otherwise desirable family of cars.  The mainstay of the Legacy lineup is the wagon, for thirteen years Subaru has sold more wagons in the US than any other importer.  The AWD wagon in general, and the Outback wagon in particular, is Subaru's response to the sport-utility shopper.  AWD, optional ABS, improved ground clearance, and a host of safety features not generally found on a truck, make the Outback wagon a decent choice for anyone looking for the utiltity of a wagon, the comfort of a car, and the capabilities of a light truck.We think that the Legacy's AWD sedans and wagons are a great idea, we just wish that they were a little bit faster.",Flat 4 cylinder ,,,all wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Flush-fitting doors and restyled exterior mirrors help quiet the ride, while horn activation switches from spoke button to center steering wheel pad. Sonata is Hyundai's midsize entry, and faces some very stiff competition in this category.  Ford's Contour/Mystique populates this class of automobiles, as does the Breeze/Cirrus/Stratus trio from Chrysler.  Perennial favorites such as the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Altima and Mazda 626 also go head-to-head with the Hyundai.  Heady competition indeed.Hyundai's forte to date has been budget prices and standard (or low-priced) luxuries that couldn't be matched by competitors.  It seems those days are over.  The 1996 Sonata GLS we sampled ran nearly $21,500.  True, it was well-loaded with automatic, sunroof, leather and power everything, but a similarly equipped Contour SE or Chrysler Cirrus was priced less than the Sonata.  Considering Hyundai's quality record, we don't find the GLS to be a viable option in this class, particularly since the Contour/Mystique twins are a real kick in the pants to drive.That's not to say that the Sonata isn't a satisfying car.  The doors thunk shut nicely, it is quiet and comfortable inside, and the leather makes it feel like a much more expensive sedan.  Everything looks and functions as though quality has been built-in, but the radio and climate controls are a tad overdone.  The back seat could benefit from better thigh and back support, but it isn't any more uncomfortable that the rear quarters of a Dodge Stratus.  Overall, we are impressed with this roomy effort from Hyundai.For 1997, Hyundai stylists have gone hog wild on the Sonata, providing the basic design with additional character through a jutting grille, revised rear styling, and intriguing headlamps.  Inside, the horn moves from a spoke-mounted button to the center pad where it belongs, and remote radio controls move from the bottom of the steering wheel to the side.  Noise, vibration, and harshness is further quelled by flush-fitting doors and restyled exterior mirrors.Unfortunately, the Sonata competes with many cars that feel as good and often cost less money.  Factor in the depreciation that the Hyundai is sure to endure, as well as the questionable quality levels of past Sonatas, and this new one's shine begins to dull.  Drop the price a couple grand, and the leather-lined Sonata GLS would begin to look like a bargain.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 4-speed automatic

Four new colors round out the changes for 2001, Integra's final year before an all-new model debuts for 2002. An absolute gem back in 1994. Eight years is a long time to go without a major update, though. The Integra replacement can't come soon enough. Yes, yes, we know that the Integra is long in the tooth and that an all-new model will be released in 2002. But don't disrespect the current model. Since its introduction in 1994, the current Integra has provided many drivers -- young, old, male and female -- with a sporty, practical, reliable and enjoyable ride. Even 5-year-old Integras still look hot cruising the streets. And the Type R, reintroduced last year after a year's absence, is a bona fide road ripper. There aren't any other cars in the sport compact market with as much longevity, style or popularity. So, despite being over the hill, the Integra is still a great car. And, just to freshen things up a little bit, this year's model gets standard carpeted floor mats and four new exterior colors. Also, an emergency trunk release has been added to the inside of the sedan's cargo area. Speaking of the sedan, those with a sense of history may want to pick one up in 2001. When the new Integra is released next year it will be available only as a three-door hatchback.We've always praised the Integra for its thrilling drive. We've even gone so far as to call it one of the top-handling front-drivers in the world. The shifter is one of the best in the industry, with a shape that fits the hand perfectly and a relatively short throw between gears. With a fully independent four-wheel double-wishbone suspension, front and rear stabilizer bars and a thick steering wheel that gives excellent feedback about what's going on down below, the Integra offers nearly the same driving enjoyment you'd get from a BMW 3 Series -- if you had twice the money for the dealer, your insurance broker and the service center. The base (on GS and LS trim levels) 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine produces an adequate, but not ripping 140 horsepower. For mega-thrills, the GS-R boasts a VTEC-enhanced 1.8-liter inline four that cranks out 170 horsepower and 128 foot-pounds of torque. When you run the gutsy Type R to 8,000 rpm, just short of its 8,500-redline, it delivers a street-racer worthy 195 horsepower, mostly due to its hand-polished intake and exhaust ports and a high-flow exhaust system. It's this raw energy that has made the Type R a cult favorite with Japanese road rocket fans.As part of Honda's larger family, you can also count on the Integra to provide excellent seating, good headroom, straightforward and functional ergonomics and exceptional build quality.So what if it's an old design; it's one of the best cars ever produced.",Inline 4 cylinder ,,,front wheel drive , 5-speed manual

Both of these truck-based  SUVs are more spacious and have higher tow ratings than three-row crossover  SUVs such as GMC's own Acadia. Like the Yukon — and its corporate  cousins, the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe ‐ the GMC Yukon XL is fully  redesigned for 2021 and aims to be a significantly more appealing SUV than its  predecessor.  
Chief  among the 2021 GMC Yukon XL's upgrades is a fully independent rear suspension.  It should provide the Yukon XL with a more supple ride since the previous  version had a traditional solid axle. An adaptive air suspension is available  for the first time too. It can lower the vehicle's ride height to help with  getting in and out or raise it for increased ground clearance. Its  load-leveling feature also helps keep the body level while towing. 
Later  in the model year, a new 3.0-liter diesel engine will be added to the options  list. Official figures haven't been released yet, but we expect it to offer  similar towing capacity to the gasoline engines — 8,000 to 8,4000  pounds, depending on powertrain choice — yet deliver improved fuel  economy.
Cargo  space is also improved compared to the previous generation, with an extra 2.2  cubic feet behind the third row. That isn't a tremendous amount, but the lower  load floor makes placing items into the back much easier. Fold the second and  third rows down and you have a whopping 144.7 cubic feet of room — an  increase of 23 cubic feet — and akin to what you'll find in most  minivans.
True,  a crossover SUV such as the Volkswagen Atlas or Kia Telluride is more  comfortable and fuel-efficient. But if you need to haul up to nine people and  their gear, or pull a heavy trailer, the 2021 GMC Yukon XL looks to be a worthy  choice.  The  Yukon XL is more expensive than the related Chevrolet Suburban, and the  benefits aren't truly realized on the lowest SLE trim. As such, consider the  midrange SLT. It's nicely equipped  with standard equipment and gives you flexibility with options. But if price  isn't a huge concern, the range-topping Denali is the best of the bunch. It comes with a more powerful V8 and unique  interior styling that further differentiates it from the Suburban. Make sure to  opt for the Advanced Technology package, which comes with adaptive cruise control — a feature sorely  missed on lower trims.",V8 cylinder ,,,rear wheel drive , 10-speed shiftable automatic 
Toyota,toyota 4runner,1996,toyota 4runner 1996,,,4.8,"A new 4Runner with a potent V6, updated styling and more interior room debuts. After a successful five-year run, the second-generation Toyota 4Runner has been retired, and not a moment too soon.  Fresh in 1990, the 4Runner aged quickly as the sport-utility market exploded and other automakers introduced larger, safer and more powerful rivals.  By 1995, the compact pickup-based 4Runner offered little, other than Toyota's reputation for reliability, to entice buyers.For 1996, Toyota has separated this high-volume SUV from its pickup truck roots.  The new 4Runner shares little with the Tacoma pickup.  As a result, engineers have created a more refined vehicle without sacrificing tough off-road ability.  Suspension travel and tread width are both up to improve off-road ability, ride, and handling.  The interior is larger in every direction, thanks to a wheelbase that is two inches longer than the previous version.  A lower floor and wider doors make getting into and out of the 4Runner less of an exercise in contortionism.  Rear leg room is up by three inches, and cargo space has been improved as well.Two engines are available on the 4Runner: a 2.7-liter inline four cylinder that makes 150 horsepower at 4800 and 177 foot-pounds of torque at 4000 rpm., and a 3.4-liter V6 producing 183 horsepower at 4800 and 217 foot-pounds of torque at 3600 rpm.  These figures represent a substantial improvement over the old anemic four cylinder and wheezy V6 -- in fact, the new 2.7-liter four is more powerful than the 1995 model's 3.0-liter six.Needless to say, all of this adds up to a much improved sport-ute.  Safety hasn't been ignored in the revamped 4Runner, which sports dual airbags.  Antilock brakes are standard with the V6 and optional on four-cylinder models.  Steering response and feel have also been improved by replacing the old recirculating ball-type steering with a rack and pinion setup.  Access to the cargo area is improved by switching from a two-piece tailgate to a one-piece hatch-style liftgate with a power-down rear window.Also new are 20-ounce cupholders, a bigger console storage area, and relocated rear speakers.  Seven new exterior colors debut, and all new interior fabrics and designs round out the new 4Runner package.  Overall, a very nice effort, resulting in a tough truck with looks to match.  Pricing runs from $20,000 for a 2WD four cylinder Base model to $36,000 for a fully loaded Limited.  This lands the 4Runner right smack dab in Tahoe, Explorer and Grand Cherokee territory.
